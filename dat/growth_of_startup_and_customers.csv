0," First of all, I posted ABBY to the usual social platforms. Twitter, Hacker News and relevant subreddits, but traffic was modest. Additionally, I had some free credits for Google AdWords, so I used them for a test campaign. The keywords for A/B testing are really expensive, so the campaign didn’t result in many clicks. But the traffic was more targeted than social traffic, so I was able to convert some visitors (ABBY was free-to-use, that helped a lot). The biggest growth occurred when someone hunted ABBY on ProductHunt. That resulted in about 20k visitors and about 100 sign-ups. ProductHunt has a diverse audience, and ABBY was a niche site, so conversion rate was pretty low. But I was satisfied, as 100 sign-ups were more than I needed to validate the idea of the service.",0,0
1," If you build it, they will come, right? Well, after that didn't work, I tried many other things, including: Adding a blog to the site and writing some articles for itEmailing my list, of courseI tried sending some cold emailsI made a spin-off site called easyecourse.com, which was the same software with a different stylesheet aimed at people who wanted to make email coursesI posted about it on Quora and Reddit a bit ‍ My nearest success was the Opt-In Form Generator, a free attached tool that actually gets a fair bit of google traffic. Unfortunately, it hasn't performed as a way to get people into the product, probably because it's something that's useful mostly to people who have already landed on a provider. I tried the free tool route a couple of other times, but that's the only one that people were actually searching for.",0,0
2," We started with maybe 20 bloggers from the network we tapped into from our market research phase. That number grew through sponsoring the in-person conference as our first big paid marketing initiative. As every blogger using the first version of our platform (pre-marketplace) was embedding a widget on their sites, we were able to effectively generate leads through that. Probably the most impactful marketing strategy for us, though, was one that most people don’t consider as a marketing tool. Our live customer support chat was really the main driver of growth. We focused on going above and beyond with empathy and immediate responses to any support requests. When issues were resolved, we would more often than not see users tweet about how great our service and support were, which drove quite a bit of organic word of mouth. One other idea was allowing bloggers to run free “ad swaps” through our platform. Bloggers would often cross-promote each other by showing ads for each other's sites. While we knew this wouldn’t be a revenue driver for us (as no money was exchanged to pull a commission from), it did help win favor and grow our blogger network. I borrowed a customer support mantra from a friend who runs a clothing business (United State of Indiana). He operated their support with a three-word mantra: “Spoil, Reward, Enlighten.” I don’t exactly remember what each of those words meant to him, but as I adapted them to our business, “Spoil” meant replying immediately and leading by seeking an empathic connection. When a customer reports an issue with their onboarding/installation, reply with “I’m so sorry - I know it’s really frustrating for me when I spend time on a platform and something goes wrong.” whether or not it was a user error. “Reward” for us meant that, after going above and beyond to help resolve the issue for the customer, we would default to refunding. So if there was a bug (or user error) that caused it to not display properly, even if it was a user error and we were able to resolve the issue quickly, we would voluntarily refund the commission from that transaction. “Enlighten”, then, was about education and/or a clear ask at the end of an exchange. “Also - just so you know - you can now run free ad swaps through Adproval. Are there any bloggers you’d like to link up with through our system?” -or- “We have a new brand getting onboarded next week in the _____ space, would you be interested in more information about their sponsorship opportunities?” Presenting a single, clear piece of information or ask with the chance for mutual value after Spoiling and Rewarding not only helped us with whatever business metric we were wanting to push but also tied together with the whole experience for the user.",0,0

6," Two things really worked in marketing. The first thing was doing a freemium B2C2B strategy where we had individual salespeople install a free version of Brisk, which we then contacted and helped out to turn it into a sales opportunity of the paid company version. The second thing was that we did a lot of user-driven content marketing. We interviewed a lot of users as we needed a lot of customer development. Instead of just throwing away these insights, we turned them into marketing material blog posts, a podcast, etc. These drove a lot of traffic to the free product.",0,0
7," I tried finding users for the app by posting to blog posts on meditation and emailing bloggers and anyone I thought would be interested. I have BusyMind App available which allows you to go through almost the exact experience of the app without registration or purchase. It's kind of an 'unlimited free trial' of the product. I think that's useful for folks who want to see what the app is about. I also reached out to friends and family, and would mention it to anyone I thought might be interested. I also wrote up a couple of blog posts on meditation and how tricky it can be, mostly as a thought experiment and to get things off my mind. Those were helpful in driving a little bit of traffic to the app.",0,0

It got 50 new user signups in the first month and the next month another 50 user signups. I used InfluenceWeekly to promote Creator Growth Lab to my existing audience and I got a dozen signups from that. I also sent direct emails to creators I knew because I had worked in the influencer marketing industry for five years. ‍",0,0
10," We did a couple of things. One was talking to friends. That was how we started. We then did some cold email outreach. We wrote some comments around the web when people were complaining about different citation tools and formatting tools. The thing that got us most of our traffic was writing articles. We wrote how-to articles where we would first talk about how to format papers. We ended up getting some SEO from that and reaching 260,000 visitors in 6 years. ‍",0,0
11," We didn’t do any paid marketing in our journey of FreshConnect as we wanted to grow organically. We were not present on any social media platform. We onboarded our customers through offline sales and used WhatsApp for communicating offers. I think customers were very responsive on WhatsApp as more than 390M users use it in India. Offline sales worked well as it allowed us to understand the problem of the customer and accordingly position our solution, which resulted in better sales.",0,0
12," We did a few different things as marketing goes. From paid ads, targeting on Linkedin, content creation (written and video), to word of mouth, we did it all. The only one that worked was WOM. The thing that made this channel work was that startups that enjoyed our service would talk to others about how great Hello Tyro was. It made our job of selling much easier with this kind of social proof. Prospects knew it worked directly from people who they trusted. It is what lacked with other marketing channels. They did not have the proof that the platform worked and they were more reluctant to make the jump and start paying for a service that can be pricey for up-and-coming startups who have limited funds. Ultimately, selling is all about creating and nurturing a relationship with your prospect. Talking with them, asking questions, and showing a genuine interest in their problems are the best strategies to turn this connection into a paying customer. After doing so, you can say if your solution could help them, and selling it is easier than just via cold emails or marketing your solution without knowing the person you’re talking to. With that in mind, we tried to connect directly on Linkedin and get the conversation going with our prospects. We did so even when they had no immediate interest in our product to acquire knowledge about the industry we were in, understand their finer problems when it came to recruiting interns.  As for other strategies, we did a few mailing campaigns without any results. We collected tons of emails during these years and decided to launch in France during the summer of 2020. So we created our campaign and sent it out. It returned no results. Automated cold emails are great because you can be lazy. Draft your email, send it to 500+ contacts but it is not a suitable strategy for an early-stage product like we had. We needed more feedback from customers and prospects to pinpoint their needs and know where to press when marketing our solution. ",0,0
13," Technicality was our forte, so we resorted to digital marketing whenever possible. We had a real gap in terms of our in-person sales and marketing skills. Call it lack of confidence, the reluctance of introversion, or the influence of laziness, both of us as co-founders had a major allergy towards meeting customers. To cover that gap we hired sales executives who would meet dentists in the city and get them on board. Our idea was to sell the application as a SaaS product. The dentists were happy to use the appointment scheduling module because it drove revenue their way. But, the practice management side of the application was barely used because a bigger player with a much higher investment was dominating the market. Though our features were on-par, dentists were already using the other product. Migrating to ours would mean losing all their patient records. We managed to bring over 900 dentists on-board and scheduled over 4000 appointments in a span of a year. These 900 users were spread across 5 different cities. Barring the city we were in, we never visited any dentist from any other location. We hired two passionate interns who signed them up along with their pricing details and photos using phone calls. They were working remotely while they managed to pull this off, so they deserve a round of applause. For getting traction, we primarily used Facebook Ads and SEO. That was right in our expertise and we managed to iterate and experiment with different digital marketing options for conversions. Since the SaaS model was not working, we pivoted our monetization model and took a percentage cut for every successful appointment. For Doondoo, we hired two junior resources for looking up information on the internet, as well as calling brands for data population. We listed thousands of businesses and I cannot recall the exact figure right now. At its peak, we had about 200K monthly page views driven by SEO. We tried different monetization models by contacting brands, but we had little success. Google ads worked reasonably well(~2K USD/month), but that was nowhere enough to scale and grow. Here is our intro video about Doondoo. The quality seems laughable today, but given the tools available in 2012 and our limited skills/budget, we did a reasonable job: ‍",0,0

15," We used Google Adwords and Facebook Ads to acquire users. Our idea was to be a multi-language app. We didn't have the money to invest in tier one markets.  We investigated how the application worked in second-tier markets and we started spending money in Pakistan, India, and Southeast Asia. We found out that women were converting better than men, so we focused on them. It was a free application, and the numbers were excellent. We were in top positions in India and Pakistan and we got cold emails from large VC funds in those countries. But that was not our main target. It was a way of testing the product, and the acquisition channels. ‍",0,0
16," Launching should not be a single event or one big event. It should be many small events that lead up to an even bigger launch. My audience was on Twitter and on Product Hunt. But in between I wanted to know if it scratched my own itch. I DM’ed some folks who had been engaging with me on Twitter around no-code. I showed them my project and asked for feedback and what it meant for them. Once you get that feedback, you can tweak the copy, make things simpler, or reduce the scope of the MVP. After that, I just tweeted about it asking for more feedback. When I did that, it was the biggest tweet I ever had at the time, with 30 likes and a bunch of retweets. After I got some users, I reached out to all of them to ask for more feedback and I kept iterating from there. ‍",0,0

18," Our growth was mostly organic. We had a focus to provide excellent service and obsession with ensuring that our customers would receive the best product of food quality and variety. We made it clear that we're doing our best to support small businesses. An additional behavior we did not expect was the desire for shared experiences, especially during the pandemic. We were uniquely positioned to offer high quality meals to friends apart from each other, enjoyed right at the same time. This was a key to having our service appreciated by users and shared with friends. And when nearby friends ordered together, this further improved our drop off efficiency. It was important to continue to expand the number of restaurants we offered and keep the options diverse. This involved a balance between exploring new options, and still offering the high demand items. Our most effective outreach to new customers was posting a friendly version of our menu to social media.",0,0

21," When we transformed MyMurmansk (community-organized movement) into MyCity (commercial product), we didn’t know anything about making government sales. Just some assumptions.   One of those was building demand from the bottom up. We thought that we could let regular citizens create websites on MyCity in their town for free. They will do all the work of creating momentum and building up pressure for local governments to get involved. Then the authorities took notice, and we would provide them with access to analytics, comments, and other premium admin features. That didn’t work at all. It might have worked in the private sector but not in government.  What worked and led us to our first few sales was just regular old-fashioned direct sales. I met with a lady who worked for the urban planning department of Tromsø (Norway) at one conference, our product happened to be precisely what she was looking for, and in several months we launched our first version in Tromsø.

23," Ok, first I need to point out that we wanted to build a marketplace. So we needed people to write itineraries and people to use/download them. First, we started by asking friends and family. We asked them to create itineraries for trips they have done, local gems they had found and things that would be great to share with other travelers. They helped to increase our portfolio of itineraries and we did a lot of social campaigns, build social communities and nothing was really working, people didn’t have a strong motivation to spend their time sharing their trip with others and we didn’t have money to pay them. We launch a contest and that brought us a few new itineraries but was just marginal. So with the itineraries we had, around 50-60, we decided to start bringing users to the site and for that, we launched social campaign and we did a fair bit of Google AdWords. People would come to the site, use the information that was available for them, download a few itineraries and leave without spending a cent.",0,1
24," I was listening to Brian Dean, the founder of Backlinko, on a podcast recently and he talked about how he consistently gets his content to rank near the top of Google for his target keywords. The answer: Create something 10x better than what currently exists. I decided to take this approach for OneUp. When you Google ""social media scheduling tools"", you find lists of the ""Top 10 Social Media Management Tools"". How could I make something 10x better? Create a spreadsheet of EVERY single social media scheduling tool. So I took the time to compare the free plan (if any), starting price, and social networks of 90 different scheduling tools and put them in a Google Sheet. I shared this spreadsheet to a few Facebook Groups and subreddits centered around social media marketing, and these are the types of comments I would get: It has kind of caught fire and has received consistent traffic. Because OneUp is frozen to the top row of the sheet, it has brought in a respectable amount of quality traffic and signups in the first couple weeks of its existence: ...and also led to many visits on the blog post version of this list that I created and linked at the top of the Google Sheet.  Quora We have also found that Quora has been a great source of quality traffic. There are tons of questions with people asking for recommendations on different types of social media tools, so we are working hard to get OneUp near the top of the answers. Almost everyone coming from Quora represents a high-quality potential user, because they are actively seeking out a solution to their problem.  Manually monitoring Facebook groups and subreddits Other more manual efforts have led to paying customers as well, such as actively monitoring relevant Facebook Groups and subreddits for people asking for solutions to their problems: It turns out our image scheduling Chrome extension was the perfect fit for what this redditor was looking for, and has since become a paying customer. Same for this person in a Facebook Group: ",1,0
25," To get our first very beta testers, I started a separate website called BetaList which features up-and-coming startups. It was pretty easy to get press coverage for that (I wrote about it in detail) which in turn lead to a lot of traffic for *openmargin. Of course, that initial press coverage only gets you so far. And while people seemed excited about the idea, this wasn’t reflected in user adoption. We quickly figured out that an e-reader app is only as good as the books you can read in them. And it was very difficult or sometimes even impossible to get your ebooks into our app. The ebook market was completely dominated by Amazon and there’s no way other apps than their own can open up Kindle ebooks. Their monopoly and use of DRM was a huge hurdle and are still today for any startup trying to innovate in this market. At the time the big publishers were still hesitant when it came to ebooks. So partnering with them seemed impossible. Fortunately, authors and indie publishers were excited. So we partnered with a bunch to make their books accessible within *openmargin. This also solved the chicken-and-egg problem where we might have 100 users, but they are all reading different books. We need a group of people all reading the same book, for the concept to work. This is something we might have figured out sooner (and not after 3 years haha) if we shipped faster rather than thinking too far ahead coming up with the ideal scenario. Anyway, starting with a handful of pre-loaded books kinda worked. But the chance that someone who downloaded our app happened to want to read one of those books was pretty low. We were in a few years in by this point, without any real traction. It was the subsidies that kept us alive while we each also had other jobs to pay the bills. I even co-founded a second startup in the meantime. ",0,0
26," As soon as I launched the beta and the idea on Twitter, it blew up. Investors started reaching out and the tweet went semi-viral because “income share agreements” were such a hot topic. A lot of people that signed up were thinking about starting an education business and monetizing through an income share agreement. From that point, it was a slow realization many people were interested in monetizing through income share agreements, few people committed to it. It turns out the market was just too small, and if you commit to using income share agreements, you didn't need our product to start. You could use a template contract and send it via email and just do everything else manually. Now, people would need our software when scaling. But there were just a handful of companies that needed it. We were trying to sell a SaaS instead of trying to sell consulting services where we’d help build these systems for them. ",0,0
27," We didn’t have a strong marketing strategy. Both co-founders were coming from technical backgrounds. So we didn’t realize that marketing is the most important part. We had a mindset like “We will make it and they will come”. They did come actually but nobody was retained :)   But we did some campaigns through Reddit, Linkedin, and Twitter to draw more traffic. I created some funny posts for developers and designers and shared them in subreddits. We kept posting updates about our project on Twitter and Linkedin. It somehow worked, we got some traffic but retention was low, unfortunately. ‍",0,0

29," Getting the site up and running for ""I Voted Remain"" was quite easy. The rest of it was marketing. The challenge was that once you do political t-shirts, marketing becomes a lot more difficult because advertising is seen as political. This was probably one of my first forays into AdWords and Facebook Ads. The advertising rules and regulations, tools, and political lines are quite challenging. You're in a niche because you're talking about Brexit. It was a nightmare to do online advertising. The key levers for growing RealityHunt were very much acquiring users because it's a dual-sided market. I needed those users to be adding different types of projects and resources to the website and build-out that community space. That was a challenge because the website didn't work that well. I didn't have the whole user management and upvoting system in place properly. It never really took off. But at some point, I'll probably restart it again. ‍",0,0
30, I held a meetup for plant-based eaters in Atlanta. It grew to a little over 100 members and was a source of initial testers. I also cross-promoted and held virtual events with plant-based influencers on Instagram. It was fine to get people to sign up but didn’t attract any paying users.‍ ‍,0,1

33," PR was our #1 driver of growth, though expensive when we paid for it and time-intensive when we did it ourselves. I think we missed a significant opportunity to invest resources into community building — a weekly Zoom with users could have gone a long way. While we wanted to keep the app free while in Beta, I wish we had experimented with charging for the product. Participating in an emerging industry presented a ripe context to network with diverse communities. Some of these explorations led to tangible outcomes (creation of Digital Wellness Collective industry trade association, volunteer support from users/fans, in-person meeting with Google and Samsung execs), while others led to distraction and overwhelm (creating an angel group for fundraising).

34," We used everything we could. Email marketing, social media, events, galas, media, new stories, speaking and interviews. They all worked and contributed to our success. The most successful thing we did was network our asses off, meeting the right people, getting our story in front of the right people was what made all the difference.  Once we had our model and plan in place we spoke at about six conferences a year, attended dozens more, added over 500 new contacts a quarter for the first three years. We were part of every local networking organization that we could be part of to talk about the business and spread the word about the business. The Chamber of Commerce served as a powerful vehicle, but it was really about getting introduced to the right people so they could introduce us to the right people. We had three TV interviews, numerous podcast interviews, and wrote articles for news outlets. One connection and meeting would lead to the next and before you know it we are being invited to Washington DC to meet with the Secretary of Education. The effort was exhausting at times, but it served as a way to “megaphone” the mission and vision so we could reach the right people who could help.  ‍",0,1
35," As we started thinking about the launch, we began reaching out to Armenian beauty influencers in Los Angeles and Armenia. We began working with them, and my sister and I flew out to Los Angeles to meet with some. The goal was to onboard them and create a networking beauty event, which would help us launch successfully.  I found it advantageous to reach out to every single tier of “influencer” one on one. The goal wasn’t to get them to advertise but to gain their insight and feedback. I would also offer them titles such as “Lead Influencer”, without committing any equity, to build out an “influencer board” (just like an advisory board). This was to ensure they felt part of the startup, rather than just another means of advertising. ‍",0,1
36," At each stage, I set an incremental goal that would advance our progress and help us win greater funding and support. Our roadmap ended up looking like this: Create a low-budget video of autonomous drones dropping packages, which we could use to show that we were serious and raise some funds. Build drones capable of dropping small packages on 100-kilometer round-trip flights.Conduct and professionally film a major demonstration in the United States, involving Syrian refugees, which would prove that we had everything we needed to take the capability overseas.Repeat that demonstration in Turkey. This dress rehearsal would prove we could get aid over the border if we just secured the right permissions.Fly a single drone over the border and drop medical supplies to a hospital.Assess, partner with a larger organization, and hopefully scale. We achieved the first three goals. A year after beginning the effort, we were reliably flying autonomous fixed-wing drone flights and dropping packages at roundtrip distances of up to 100km. We conducted an amazing demonstration in California and produced a professional video. BBC also flew out to observe and produced a beautiful video story. In the wake of that success, we launched a crowdfunding campaign to fund goals 4 and 5--taking our capabilities to Turkey and then, hopefully, to Syria.  ‍",0,0
37," I promoted the blog and eBook through Twitter, Facebook, G Plus, Triberr, and YouTube. At its core, this was a sound marketing strategy. I generated over 1000 page visits a day by aggressively sharing this blog in the right spots and by commenting on top blogs and linking into the blog.

38," It was the hardest part because of our lack of marketing experience. We planned to get the first paid users from friends and cold emailing. Our second step was to launch on Product Hunt and then scale. It looks naive, but it was our plan. We started with cold direct messaging on Facebook and commenting in marketing groups. We had interviews with marketers with crazy optimistic feedback. We got some signups. None of them was a paying user, but we started getting feedback from real users.  One month later, we decided to launch Product Hunt. We ended the day in the 6th position. We got some traffic, feedback, and messages like “Toki is awesome!”. However, Product Hunt will not do magic for your project. Our launch translated into thousands of visits, a few dozen free users, and zero paid users. ‍",0,0
39," Mainly just cold emailing and using Linkedin for direct outreach. I posted blog content on LinkedIn groups once every 2 weeks. Starting was darn slow, but as I got my messaging dialed-in, I got more and more sales calls. The initial solution was generating leads through Facebook ads. But after the first 10 sales call, I realized that this wouldn’t be the right application given that we’re dealing with businesses (B2B) while Facebook was more suited for consumers (B2C). That’s also why I pivoted to generating leads through Linkedin. ‍ I bombed my first 60-70 sales calls, as I was still getting better at sales. Think of it as learning to ride a bicycle the first few times. You probably suck at it and fell many times before you can ride smoothly. Pitching to these 7-9 figure guys was not easy. They were sharpshooters, brutal, and would tear my sales pitch apart. I had my ego bruised real bad, but after a while, I kinda became immune to rejections. It was only from the 80-100 calls onwards that I started to get better at sales. I started noticing similar patterns of smokescreen these guys would throw. Things got easier because I was fully prepared. I entered each call knowing what these guys were going to say, and how I could counter their objections. That’s when I started closing clients and getting paid (3 clients at $2k retainer). That hurdle was over, but delivering results and retaining clients was a bigger problem I couldn’t solve, and eventually led to the downfall of Uptrend Consulting. ‍",0,0
40," Technically, our business never took off because the entire time we made ZERO revenue. I know… shocking. Looking back at this time I would have slapped the younger me so hard that I’d need to reconsider everything I was doing.  Nonetheless, the main marketing strategy was hoping for SEO to succeed. To get listings I reached out on Craigslist and added them for free. I vastly underestimated the amount of time it would take for SEO to work considering our website had no authority whatsoever. You could say the startup fuel was hopium.  One advantage we had is that people were eager to be listed (well, it was free, duh!). I found that property owners or managers were mostly kind and fun people to talk to. Many understood our mission and were eager to be a part of it. Not being a larger company played to our advantage in terms of communicating with people. ‍ I cannot underscore the gravity of just how bad we did during this time. At our height, we had maybe a max of 200-300 listings. For the organic SEO strategy to work, we’d need thousands of listings on day one to start getting aged in SERPs, assuming we did an amazing job building backlinks to the site.",0,0
41," Our main growth channel was actually speaking and hosting events. We were able to acquire and grow a Meetup collective to over 12,000 members, and use that to send people to marketing events. We would do in-kind sponsorships of marketing events, handling all social media and advertising, in exchange we would get a booth at the event, and that would often result in business. Other than that, we had 2nd order business. A few of our clients ended up leaving certain companies, which ironically typically meant our arrangement was going to come to an end as well. And when they would land at another company, they would bring us in. So it wasn’t so much referral, like in other agencies, but actually 2nd order business. And the 3rd and most unique to us way we secured business was talking about our competitors and pricing transparently on our website. We ranked #1 for “Digital Marketing Agency San Diego” back when we were nothing and the big companies honestly should have been able to hold that spot. But because we compared our competitors to us, we outranked them. They all shared our content and loved that we sent them leads, and that was fine for us, because every agency works with different types of businesses, and we highlighted when to go to Internet Marketing Inc, or IDEA, or any other agency that would have honestly been a better fit. In that way, we got the right leads for us, and automatically sent out the ones that weren’t a good fit. Now, that being said, we had lots of content fails, like when we thought we should use an online course to get new clients - so I created a course on setting up a Wordpress site, maybe got 4 people to buy it, no clients, and wasted a good 2-3 weeks of my time on that one. And of course, there were some partnerships and events that never really panned out. One event in particular cost us a lot of work and when all was said and done, no one in the audience seemed to be a good fit target client for us, you could tell right at the start of the day too, so 80 hours of work to get the sponsorship and one whole day of “tabling” wasted. The one learning from all this is really understanding who you want to engage with (from a target audience perspective) and making sure you really understand why they would want to engage with you, where they hang out, what problems they have. Of course, this is something a marketing agency is supposed to know really well, but even the best will make mistakes or overlook something. ‍",0,0
42," I coded the first version on my own, then recruited partners to work with me. One was a business person whose job was fundraising and product marketing. The other was a designer whose job was making things look good. The company was funded on my savings, which came from my previous business, which had made a nice profit on outsourced web development.",0,0
43," There we find one of the issues: a yearly enrollment doesn’t allow scalability. That’s why at first, we planned two enrollments per year with growing participant numbers. To ensure the quality of members, we needed more applications per seat. As we had a very unique target group, we couldn’t go for Instagram ads or something similar. So we looked for niche communities like entrepreneurship initiatives at top universities, my podcast targeting young and aspiring entrepreneurs, recommendations from the most successful entrepreneurs in our network, and of course entrepreneurs from the network of our participants who were already part of the program.  Later on, we switched to a paid community for young entrepreneurs. This pivot was due to the pandemic and other issues. Our growth strategy with the paid community was the same as before except we could onboard as many entrepreneurs as we want. ",0,0
44," At first, I was selling all my products on eBay. If you’re unfamiliar with eBay as a seller, it’s essentially like your first time with a prostitute. Everybody is disappointed with the end result, the seller is always the one getting fucked and when it’s all over you’re crying in the dark alone. I realized it wasn’t a long-term solution and decided to move away from it. Over time I would sell my products on my own website, however I didn’t invest a single dollar into marketing. All sales were made either through word of mouth or referrals. I’d like to refer to my blog post titled: “My Early Business Life: A 6 Figure Business That Fell Apart When I Was 16” where I talked about one of my marketing strategies: “Because I was always busy both before and after school, some of my friends caught wind of what I was doing and wanted in. Looking back now, I had somehow recruited affiliates, but back then they were simply friends helping out. I had designed a flyer template which I gave to each affiliate (I’ll stick with the term affiliate for now) and had them add in their name and contact number at the bottom of the flyer. I raised my prices to $55.00 per item giving each affiliate $15.00 per sale which left me with $40.00 profit. I remember before the Christmas break going to school a few times with a box full of MP3 players and handing out lots of 10 to people who expressed interest in selling. This was probably one of the easiest things I did to make a few thousand dollars – who knew teenagers were good salespeople!” Within a few months, the business was doing it pretty well and was on track to 6 figures in the first year. My entrepreneurial story started to go viral which helped me make Zor Technology more famous. However, everything was going too well to be true. Only a few months before the business turned one year, I was forced to shut it down.",0,0
