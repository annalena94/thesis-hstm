0," Finding time is the biggest obstacle in expanding 10er and the other side projects I have. With a full-time job and 2 kids (son 4 years, daughter 10 months 🤯) free time can be hard to come by. This reality has forced me to make 10er as autonomous and small as possible. I still don’t have a custom admin interface and still do some things manually in the terminal. Project sign ups still go through me personally for instance. It’s almost like forced non-growth. I tell myself that this is both a curse and a blessing. I’ve personally connected with and spoken to every project using the service and have never had any problems with abuse or the like.  I’ve made lots! Handling people’s money and credit cards make everything a lot more serious so mistakes feel like your entire world is breaking up. I’ve had made a few stomach-turning mistakes: The first time I ran the charge script, it wasn’t idempotent. That is, when a charge failed (for some reason. They do a lot, I know now) the entire script would start from the beginning charging everyone again. When I realized what it was doing, it felt like sweat sprung from my entire body like one of those garden sprinklers. The fix was to make the script look for existing charges before charging. That way it never charges twice for the same donation. At one point I consolidated two kinds of user accounts (project owners and donators. It was very confusing) I jumbled almost everyone’s subscriptions. When I ran the charge script a few weeks later, people were charged for other people’s subscriptions. I almost felt the earth shake when I realized. Rebuilding everyone’s subscriptions ended up taking a few weeks and I was very embarrassed. Still, both times only a few people didn’t accept my apology. I think I had 2 or 3 users leave from those accidents. Everybody else was very forgiving and appreciated my swift response and openness. Always be humble and honest. ‍",1,0
1," The biggest challenge for me has always been, and still is, giving 40 Aprons my absolute focus. Because it’s enjoyable and has always been my passion, it always was pushed to the back burner for me. And today, client work and deadlines always come first, but I have to remind myself: all of this is a reality because of the blog. That should be my #1 focus always!  In terms of challenges within the industry, there is so much content now, and it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd. It took time for me to do this, and I’m still working on it! But given the sheer volume of food blogs these days, it’s challenging for almost everyone to separate themselves, develop a recognizable style, and drum up a loyal followership of people who really relate to what you’re doing and how you’re doing it. It wasn’t until I really narrowed down my niche, and then narrowed it further by analyzing the content that performed best with my audience, that I was able to feel successful on this spectrum. Now that I’m established in the niche and know very well what works and doesn’t work with my audience, I’m working hard to pump out the content that my readers want, whilst integrating a voice that resonates with them (Thankfully, that’s my regular voice, but I include my more family-oriented perspective these days) to continue to grow a presence. I want my site and content to be more than a random recipe found on Pinterest I want it to be a collective, a voice, more of a destination than a chance stop along the way. ‍  40 Aprons is so old, you can witness every mistake or total lack of skill or knowledge like layers of fossils. For a long time, my photography was absolutely atrocious, and in the beginning, it didn’t really matter! Today, food bloggers consistently produce magazine-quality photography, but a decade ago, cell phone shots were a-OK. That, of course, changed, and I tried to adapt to it.  And then, of course, there was the creative titling, naming things “So Nice They Named It Twice” rather than what the dish actually was. Again, back then, people weren’t searching on Pinterest for recipes (Because Pinterest didn’t exist!), and priority was always, always given to mega food sites, so on top of it being less visible, there were simply no real resources to learn best practices.  The biggest mistake, though, would have to be my tendency to keep 40 Aprons always idling in the driveway, burning fuel and resources but not really going anywhere. I saw quick growth after I gave it my all, but, to be fair, I spent many years learning the skills that allowed me to do so.",1,1
2," I was unaware of how difficult it is to grow a B2B business, even more, if it is a niche product. Also, I was not well prepared for launch there was no strategy. Promoting a product is hard. Doing so without a plan is virtually impossible. ‍",0,0
3," My biggest mistake is that I really don't want to do anything but write software, and that only works if your product is so narrowly focused and immediately useful that it practically sells itself. I guess this is the usual mistake for a technical solo founder: I made a thing that nobody really needed. We're trained to make our software as general as it can reasonably be, but for the purposes of operating a small business, you really need to target a small niche, which I was never able to find. ‍",0,0
4," Here are the main mistakes: Working without salary: You have a family so, sooner or later, you are going to get exhausted and frustrated.Picking a wrong business partner: I now have a thumb rule that consists of never ever picking a co-founder from your family or friends and never picking a co-founder who doesn’t add value (besides money)Planning: Plan for 5 years and backtrack that. Iterate until you reach a level where you have visibility of the goals in the next 15 days.Realistic goals: Your goals should be realistic and also should be objective enough to get traced in a metric. Not hiring people: Not hiring sales/marketing staff is one of the most common mistakes and we’ve also committed it. Some challenges we faced were: Creating a regular sales funnel and pipeline.Lack of focus and doing a lot of things simultaneously.Building a portfolio and pitching customers. It was a chicken and egg challenge. ‍",0,0
5," Jared: As we mentioned earlier, we’d started explicitly as a student plan. We had a partnership with the University of Central Florida, and we were marketing it to the students directly. That ended up being a pilot program that taught us what was working and what wasn’t. Selling to students directly was challenging because they didn’t know a lot about warranties, so we started integrating transparency and education about how insurance works in our product. And, of course, working more with students’ parents and school administrators helped us achieve better results. Eric: Once we decided to expand and go national, we had to learn how to find our customers. You might think that our base of potential customers is everyone, but it’s tough to appeal to everyone at once, so we tried to hit a number of highly specific demographics. It was like, “Okay, musicians will want this, and extreme-sports enthusiasts will want this,” and so on. So we tried appealing to these somewhat niche groups, but it didn’t work. But we learned a lot about our customers, and we learned not to make assumptions about consumer behavior and purchasing decisions without the data to back them up.  ",1,0
6," It took us a while to find the right backend system for Aplano. Before using Firebase we struggled with slow processes in deploying the application and fixing bugs. With Firebase that problem vanished.  We were competing in a market with well-funded companies and lots of manpower. What we were lacking in experience we had to make up for with hard work and long nights. So all of us started to specialize in different areas to be able to compete. We went through a difficult period but I have to admit, it was well worth it since all of us ended up learning new skills, gaining experience, and broadening our knowledge in the saas market.  Ranking in Google was also quite the hassle. We didn’t have much experience at first and therefore faced the issue with a typical “try and error” approach. It cost us some time, but we started to understand how to deal with SEO in the end.  ",1,0
7," We did not spend enough time validating the idea through customer interviews before investing in building the MVP. This meant that with every day we spent building the tool we were increasing the likelihood of confirmation bias (this is the right thing to do because we are doing it), this ultimately lead us to spending too many resources on what was ultimately a poor business idea. ‍",0,0
8," I find you only have one of two problems: time or money. In our case, it’s time. Although we’re bootstrapped, we’re two very resourceful guys but college can get in the way when you’re trying to get it done as quickly as possible.  As an example, James is in his last semester for his Master’s in Engineering and spending this semester researching ways to regenerate neural networks if they become corrupted. Oddly, that correlates with what we’re doing at Aura but that also requires deep work sessions.  Luckily, he graduates in the coming weeks and our little obstacle won’t be a problem anymore.  I think it also helps to put problems within context. I like asking the question if something is physically possible. If something is physically possible, then you just have a knowledge or information problem. Problems are easy to solve once you understand that something is possible. Then, you just need to learn how to make it possible for you.   I’m incredibly happy that we’re bootstrapped. It made us focus on revenues from day 0. I find that’s very understated. In the early days, bootstrapping makes sense but at some point, you may need to raise money when the ROI is clearly positive.  As an example, if our paid ads are well below 1:3, CAC:LTV, we would be giving up a positive investment in our company. Being bootstrapped can mean that you capture only a percentage of that opportunity.  At some point, raising money may make sense. Not now, but maybe at some point.  Outside of that, this is our first tech company as entrepreneurs. We both run successful small businesses but this is a whole new level that we’re excited to learn about. It’s the Dunning-Kruger Effect, where your confidence is too high when you know little and becomes more realistic when you realize how little you actually know.  Now, it’s learning and applying everything that we’re learning to build the company we’ve always wanted to build.  ",1,0
9," Our biggest challenge was hiring. Hiring full-time mechanics meant paying them even when we had no work. But we believed that hiring meant that mechanics were always ready to go and that they were of higher quality. We learned that we needed to have a continual hiring process and that a high attrition was the norm in the industry. Unfortunately, we were never able to completely solve this problem. Another mistake we made was trying to expand so quickly. After meeting many investors, we were always told that our numbers were too low. This got us into a bad cycle of trying to acquire as many customers as possible, using the fastest methods. This ended up causing the resignation of many mechanics, due to too the big work demand.",0,0
10," What we understood was that you always need to be ready to overcome challenges.  In our case, there was a big chance of failure due to our relationships - it's always hard to run a company with your life partner. When you launch a business with equal partnership, conflicts are almost inevitable as there are two leaders and two opinions.  Sometimes, this can cause a deadlock, but luckily, we've found a solution. From the start, we decided to divide our spheres of influence. Besides, as a CEO, Roman has veto power, makes the final decision, and takes responsibility for it.  We've learned to plan everything from the very beginning, analyze our progress, and count risks. Because success won't happen if you back away when facing challenges. ‍",1,0
11," For me, the biggest challenge has always been maintaining a strong focus. I am the type of person that comes up with more ideas than I could ever bring to life and gets excited about them quickly.  But having only minimal resources in my startup phase, I had to learn the hard way that I couldn’t do it all at once. And if I nevertheless tried realizing many ideas at once, I often ended up with a bunch of half-done tasks. That’s why I always create three months OKRs for myself and the company to know exactly what I will be working on - and even more importantly, what I will not be working on over the following weeks.  That helps a lot, but staying on my plan remains a huge struggle to this day.   The whole startup fundraising market is very crowded. On one side, you have all these providers of cheap templates that are bringing out new designs weekly. And on the other side, you have very focused software providers that came to the market with a lot of funding. For an independent company like ours, it's always hard to find a place in the middle and especially have visibility. That is ultimately what we are fighting for with all of the competitors. Luckily, the market in total is huge and every founder needs something different. So there are still enough people who see BaseTemplates as the best solution for them and we try to be as outspoken about it as possible.  Another huge mistake that I made repeatedly was not being consistent with content creation on our blog. I hate writing, so this is something that I always pushed to the bottom of my to-do list and ended up dropping quite often. But especially with SEO, it is important to stay consistent with your content creation. And we could have been twice our size if we had just continued to create blog content regularly. ‍",1,0
12," I’ve been passionate about our business, our products, and the community from day #1, however when building the business I never anticipated what it meant to be a leader of an organization. For the longest time, I put off managing duties with the hope that our hires would just get it. Of course, they didn’t (no fault to them), and it lead to several headaches. After about 3 years we finally understood that for the business to grow we needed to become better managers. We implemented the techniques from Traction which helped us set KPIs, improve our hiring process, and maintain our vision.    In the early days, we gave our team a lot of freedom without many guidelines, accountability, or metrics. Subsequently, it was challenging for them to know if they were being successful in their role and they didn’t have all the information they needed to make appropriate decisions. One season we made investments into inventory that would take 24 months to clear through. Fortunately for us, the product isn’t perishable and we’re able to work through it, but it’s not fun having that much capital in inventory that won’t move for a long time. Other challenges came in the form of our proofing process (or lack of one). We’ve had several products that needed to be destroyed, recalled, or re-produced because labels were wrong. After about 5 years and tens of thousands of dollars of loss, we’ve finally made it a top priority to resolve and mistakes have dropped dramatically. ‍",1,0
13," Challenges you have faced in the process of building and growing Bediwin Information Services. Far and away the biggest challenge was finding prospective customers. Experienced salespeople will explain the concept of a sales funnel to you and honestly, most of that isn’t rocket science, but they won’t tell you how to find prospects to go in the top.   Your personal and your team disadvantages. I was selling a service my prospects didn’t want to a target market that was mostly in survival mode and would have seen me as a frivolous expense (at best) and a waste of time that they didn’t have (at worst). ‍ Mistakes you have committed. I assumed that my prospects would recognize the value I could offer straight away. This, it turns out, was wrong. Towards the end, I started to look at other businesses in the area and I noticed that they almost invariably had one thing in common: the product or service they could offer, and the benefits thereof, were immediately obvious. I found precisely one business that wasn’t in this position, and in that case, it had taken the owner about eight years to make it work. The second mistake I made was I put precisely the wrong amount of money in. If I’d started out the business with nothing, I would have recognized immediately that I needed to work hard to get some money in. If I’d started out the business with a very large sum of money, I could have spent that on growing the business more quickly. Instead, I put £5,000 in. Which, it turns out, was enough to leave me thinking “Hey, I’ve got loads of cash in the bank, I don’t need to worry!” but not enough to engage the sort of professional help I needed. ‍",0,0
14," Where to begin… The most challenging part of a startup IMO is handling the daily or even hourly swings. Super highs and super lows. Keeping even and staying the course is paramount. In our services business back in the day, we had to learn the hard lessons of understanding our value and how our perception of ourselves translates into reality and success. With Bildr, the learning comes straight from users and customers. It’s a constant process of failure and iteration. Sometimes these are small things and not very costly other times, they have a tangible impact through lost time and capital.",1,0
15," When I founded BizzBee, I made the mistake of relying solely on freelancing platforms as my primary source of work.  It was a good short-term strategy, but I clung to it for much too long. I was afraid of rejection, and I didn’t reach out to people.  That was something that could have killed my dream right from the start. Luckily, I decided that even though I am terrified, I am going to do my best. I will dive into the wild waters and swim with the big sharks.  Either they will eat me, or I will learn how to swim with them. At first, I did everything wrong, of course.  I was that needy, pushy salesperson that I now teach people not to be.  You can now see where that comes from and why I tell people not to do it. The chances are, making your first move a sales pitch will only get you the rejection you are so afraid of.  If you approach people with the sole intention of selling them something, they will give you the leg. Instead of selling, you should be building.  Yes, you read that right. Building rapport, connection, relationships with your prospects.  Instead of just talking, try listening to people. Instead of assuming, try asking.  That’s the right and the only way of doing outreach. ",1,0
16," So far, I’ve gotten incredibly lucky with Blogging for Devs. But that’s mostly because I made all the classic, first-time founder mistakes with my first product, Affilimate: No distribution plan beyond “build it and they’ll tell their friends”Not diversifying the customer baseHaving a time-sensitive marketing plan that relied solely on SEO (which has a timeline of its own, especially in a competitive niche like affiliate marketing). Thankfully, I was able to do the opposite of many of these mistakes with Blogging for Devs and it had a positive result. And I’ve managed to turn around most of those with my SaaS, too, and things look wildly different than they did a year ago. Some things just take time :) ",1,1
17," GILAD: So for me, it was the dependencies. Driving 45 minutes to the lab every time was exhausting and time-consuming. And It took much time and energy talking to restaurants, persuade them to join, persuade them to pay for the food-check, going like that door-to-door, and realizing that we can’t make a progress at one front without a progress in the other. Restaurants wanted to see users, but they wouldn’t come without restaurants, and restaurants asked how many users do we have before paying for the food-check. I figured that this is not how I want the business to come about. It’s like we were a low-tech business, with just an app to support it. Of course, if we had money then a guy would have delivered the dishes to the lab for us, or we would have paid for ALL the food checks just as a proof of concept instead of asking restaurants to pay, etc. But we just couldn’t go on like this. ‍ SHAKED: I think that what disturbed me the most and always felt like a problem, was the fact that I want to keep on traveling and live abroad. As Gilad mentioned that would have been quite complicated thinking about the way things worked. ‍",0,0
18,"  When we first started, we didn’t account for the seasonality of the travel industry. So there was a point when our revenue stopped growing, and we got very worried that it would never come back. Revenue eventually picked up again, but it taught us that seasonality is very much part of the travel industry and something we need to plan around. ‍",1,0
19," Building an ops-intensive e-commerce startup is scary: when ordering our first run of inventory, we found ourselves wiring a good chunk of our pre-seed funding to our factories in China. If you haven’t raised much money or are bootstrapping, managing working capital is key. Once you demonstrate traction, you’ll be able to secure an asset-backed line of credit to finance your inventory. Until then, it pays to negotiate supplier and payer terms to minimize your working capital needs. In general, operations is the toughest part of our business. We’ve learned that writing clear service level agreements (SLAs) to govern our relationship with fulfillment partners avoids issues later on. What happens if goods are damaged in route? What are the penalties if your supplier ships the wrong color of a product? If you don’t know what a good SLA looks like, ask someone running logistics at a similar business to help. Be prepared to do things yourself to learn what to expect from your partners my co-founders and I have delivered and built probably hundreds of pieces of furniture ourselves.  PR is tougher for a B2B product, but we’ve learned that every business has angles relevant to a general audience. If you’re solving a big enough problem that customers care and like you, there is a reporter and audience out there who will care too. Figure out what you know that will change their thinking about the area you’re building in. Provide evidence if you can there’s nothing like compelling data for a successful pitch.  We made too many mistakes to count! It sounds simple, but here’s a general concept we’ve gotten much better at applying over the past year: identify critical assumptions early on and dig as deep as you can to verify them. What are the key things you have to believe for your business to succeed? If they’re that important, stress test your assumptions!  For example, we made assumptions about the availability of a certain acquisition channel early on based on anecdotal evidence, but didn’t verify until it was too late. In a weird way, for smart people in particular, it can be tempting to cover your eyes and avoid digging in because you’re worried about a key assumption being proven wrong.  Resist the urge to protect the sunk costs of your thesis better to go back to the drawing board early than plunge into months of work under false pretenses. ‍",1,0
20," We should have been more focused and built a smaller product. The biggest headache of building Brisk was that we had two “open surfaces”: both the data and the user interface.  We were flexible on what data to use and how to interpret it (What is a good deal in your Salesforce instance? How long time should one wait till call again?) and the user interface and user. We allowed a lot of different use cases and ended up having a very unfocused development, onboarding, and sales. Salesforce is a very flexible system, and we ended up spending massive amounts of time to support all the different customizations that were done and then propagating that to the user.                                                                                                                                                       ",0,0
21," Taming Chrome and getting users! Chrome (which is the defacto headless browser) is just crazy-hungry for resources, so babysitting it and providing a web-service around it is crucial. Some folks don’t even put things like concurrency-limits around it and just let their apps go crazy running Chrome jobs, but there’s such a high-risk of it bringing down your entire stack if you don’t contain it. This is why having something open-sourced is extremely helpful: just because I maintain the project doesn’t mean I know everything about it and can fix everything. The community sort of gathers around the best-in-class and helps to make it better. Getting users and understanding their feedback can especially be challenging when starting. I think it’s important to know that not everything is a rocket-ship, and that if you enjoy the project and it’s fun when you can make sacrifices elsewhere (like growing crazy fast). No one wants to sell their soul for money…. or at least they shouldn’t!! Technically speaking the greatest challenge was the debugger. Chrome comes bundled with a remote-debugger that’s incredible, but getting all the other pieces working (like user-submitted scripts, type-ahead, linting, error-handling) is a lot to manage. Overcoming that was a big win for me, as I now solely use that tool for writing any new scripts. ‍  So many mistakes were made. Some that come to mind: Not building an audience earlierNot having a good strategy for content marketingBeing ahead of where the market wasDocumentation was lackingNot sleeping enough I love that there’s a lot of good things too. I definitely shipped early, often, and listened to users a lot. I think this helped bring browserless up to speed on where other cloud-providers are, but wish I would have spent more time on polish and documentation. ‍",1,0
22," I already mentioned some of the emotional ups and downs. The biggest challenge so far has been the lack of money. We run everything with our own time and money, and this has become increasingly difficult. During the low times, you can really start to ask yourself, is it worth it to keep going? We’re about to break even, so the investment is paying off slowly—but it is working!  We are now in a kind-of profitable situation, which means that we can pay our expenses, but we cannot afford to pay a salary to ourselves. Still, we do not need to keep putting money in, which is good, but we have to work for free. I hope soon enough we reach the so-called “ramen profitability”, where we can get paid something, even if a little bit, that might not make a big difference but for sure will help in lifting our spirits. We have overcome this limitation for now by splitting our time between Bugfender and consultancy work (for Mobile Jazz). It is not ideal but it is working, though it has been extremely difficult.    On a personal level, I know I am too pessimistic. I have to be careful how I phrase things or how I express my feelings with the team since I could damage their morale. Fortunately, I happened to team up with the right people and we rely on each other’s support when things go out of balance. It has worked very well so far. As a team, I mentioned everyone who works on Bugfender also works on Mobile Jazz, mainly for economic reasons. We maybe could have made the decision to hire someone completely external earlier, who would work full-time on Bugfender. I think the multi-tasking has made us miss some good opportunities.  Also, as a company, I think we have not experimented enough with pricing just yet. We have a pricing based on certain assumptions but we have not tested much. For example, right now we have a free plan which we believe helps people try Bugfender without fear. However, how would changing the free plan for a trial work? We do not know. On the technology side, we have also made mistakes. Working in Go seemed very appealing in the beginning since we were eager to learn about new technologies but Go at that moment was not mature and we have paid the price for it. Also, today we are still finding it difficult to find experienced developers. Something causing problems was the choice of libraries. We chose martini as the web framework and it resulted to be extremely poor performance even its author moved on to a new project called gin. Migrating away from martini to the native HTTP library has improved the performance about 10x for us, saving us (or in the previous months costing us) thousands of dollars, literally. For database access, we used gorm (version 1). But also gorm was mostly rewritten in the following months, resulting in an incompatible API from the version we use it mainly means we should rewrite our code and do a thorough data migration… we are probably going to leave gorm and stick to sqlx, which is a widely used library giving us better control on performance. I guess this is all a reflection of the evolution in the language as the development community matures. We wrote a blog post about Go and the choice of libraries, listing all the pros and cons—maybe it could help other people make better choices next time.  Also, we naturally have had to evolve the primitive MySQL based system. Relational databases are not good at write-heavy workloads such as log storage. We have evolved it into a more complex setup with MySQL only for certain data, then using Kafka and Elasticsearch primarily for storing logs, with some help of Redis for caching the most commonly accessed data.",1,0
23," It’s not easy to build a startup when you're married, have a 1-year-old, a family to think of and debts to pay :) But luckily, I had some resources in my bank account which allowed me not to focus on the money, but on the journey ahead. The biggest challenge we faced was when Roxana, my co-founder, was hit by a car and needed a few months to recover (she’s doing great now, in perfect shape). This was the trigger to go out to find sources of investment.  6 months later we got €750K in our bank accounts for our first seed round, led by Early Game Ventures. ‍  I think we should have launched the product even faster. We were slow about taking some bold actions. We wanted to build a product for everyone and we were so happy that people listened to us and gave their feedback that we forgot to ask ourselves a question: Is this feedback relevant for us, for what we are building? ‍ What’s the real use case? Is it a relevant opinion? Feedback is great, but if you listen to the wrong advice, it can end up killing your startup. Or you’ll build something that you don’t want to build. Create a company neither for yourself nor for your customers. And then you yourself will kill your startup. ",1,0
24," I didn't trust that it could work. I was too afraid that I'd spend all of my time on the app and building an audience, but nothing would come of it. Because of this, I stopped working on it all together and ""gave up"" on the idea. I'm not saying that if I stuck with it it was a guaranteed success, but there's been an ongoing interest in the app and I've received some really positive app reviews. I think had I kept on working on it, it may not have been a financial success, but would have still been a worthy effort. ‍",0,0
25," I struggled first with the courage to leave my comfortable job and salary. It's easy to stay in a job where you are comfortable, content, and have a steady salary coming in, so gaining the confidence to take that leap and follow my dreams was a really difficult thing to do, especially having doubts and measuring success. There are challenges every day, and I see them as opportunities to make a difference. I love it. If I never would have taken that jump from my job to entrepreneurship, I'm not sure if I ever would have. Taking the risk is initially the hardest thing to do, but if something scares you enough, that means you're doing something right. ‍  Honestly I don’t see any disadvantages – I am truly blessed to have the advantages I have. And mistakes? I make them every day, just like all of us. The important thing is to recognize them quickly, and fix them quickly.  When we started scaling, I was convinced that we could trust our logistics to a third party. After only two months, I realized this was not going to work for us. I flew to Indiana and personally supervised the transfer of our goods back to California where we could control it and guarantee the customer experience I want. The customer is always right, and a true, honest experience for the customer can make or break a sale. This is something Buttercloth is passionate about, giving our customers the most memorable e-commerce experience we can. ‍",1,0
26," The biggest challenge I faced was taking that first step to introduce Campertunity to the world. When the website was finished and ready to be launched, we were standing in the kitchen of my small Vancouver condo and sweating just before hitting the “launch” button. Then, I did it. I hit launch...then waited.  Before Campertunity launched, we had media attention. So much of it that we were in the newspaper and on the radio before Campertunity even had one user signed up. So, by the time launch day arrived, we had 250 people who had signed up on our landing page. Here we are, thinking that by pressing the launch button, hundreds of people are going to list their land and Campertunity is going to make thousands in its first year.  As you can maybe imagine, that wasn’t the case at all. The launch button was pressed, 3 people listed their land, and the website was almost stagnant for another 6 months. Camping season was over.    Our greatest disadvantage is that camping is seasonal, meaning Campertunity is a seasonal business. We are busy all year round with marketing but the interest just isn’t there in the middle of December. That’s simply a reality we have to face in Canada.  Our second disadvantage is that we don’t know how to code. Although people smarts are a great quality to have, growing up in the 80’s didn’t have any advantage in learning how to code. With many tech start-ups being created by people in their early 20’s who have nothing to lose and all the knowledge of a computer, it’s hard to keep up with maintaining our own website and tweaking it to suit the appearance and functionality that we want.  And, my mistake: I wish we had started small and then grown bigger. It would have been easier and we could have gathered more attention if we focused first on British Columbia, my home province, and then expanded as we became more popular and with more revenue. But, we started big...all of Canada, and marketing to the second largest country in the world is a lot of work that’s overwhelming. We can’t reverse what we did because we already have a few listings and users across Canada, but we may shift our marketing back to BC and grow more at home.  ",1,1
27," Raising money is one of the hardest and longest processes so far. We’re raising $150,000 and started fundraising in September of 2018. There is also additional pressure since Canary is not yet making enough money for Josh and me to pay ourselves. For me, I have no other income, so I’m currently eating through my savings to be able to do this full time. Once we close this round, I’ll feel a huge weight lifted off my shoulders since I’ll be able to have some income, regardless of how small. The biggest advantage of raising money is that it buys us time to operate for the next 12-14 months. In terms of actually finding investors and raising money, that presents another problem. How do you meet investors? For me, I met most of our investors through Shapr. Shapr is basically Tinder for networking. Whether you’re looking to meet investors, find an engineer, or just network with people in your area, Shapr will help. Another challenge I have personally faced, which I alluded to earlier, is dealing with rejection. I have never been trained in sales and have had no prior experience before Canary. You can imagine the wake-up call I had when the first dozen venues told me they weren’t interested. It was hard in the beginning, but I’m learning to have thicker skin. There’s no easy way to get comfortable with rejection, but being able to adjust my expectations is something that’s eased that pain. ‍  I made a few technical mistakes early on in developing the app. Although building a web app is great, it was done incorrectly. I didn’t create a codebase with reusable code and so trying to update it was a nightmare. I also should have used React but instead used mostly PHP and jQuery. That just meant that, even if I wanted to do something simple, I had to write a lot of code to get it done. With React, and now with Swift/Kotlin, you can get so much more done with a small amount of code. We haven’t made all the right moves in how we approach selling, but we also didn’t have any experience in selling something like this. I wouldn’t call them mistakes, but there was just a learning curve that took a few months to figure out. There was no easy way to figure out how to sell, it was just being aware of how we were doing and constantly improving it. ‍",1,0
28," The biggest obstacle I overcame was uncertainty and doubt. I came very close to giving up and selling Career Sidekick multiple times, for a shockingly low amount (I was earning very little from it for years, and the sale price would have surely been below $10,000). Now, as my site competes with much larger businesses (some with 50-200 employees) to get attention and search traffic, I’m facing new obstacles, but I’ll have to return in a few years to describe how that turned out :) The biggest mistakes I’ve made: Trying to do everything myself for too long instead of hiring help and trusting others. I think because the nature of my business is so scalable, it allowed me to get away with doing everything myself for a very long time. I would have been forced to delegate tasks much sooner in another business model like a service business (marketing agency, content writing agency, etc). However, the business began growing faster once I overcame this mental block and trusted others to help with the operations. This is a transition that’s in progress and that I still need to improve upon. This also allows me to play to my strengths. I’m not very detail-oriented, for example, so I’ve hired an editor and proofreader so that I never have to read any content before it gets published. That’s a huge help and frees me to do higher-impact tasks. Also, at the very beginning, I was far too hesitant to spend money and invest in the business. I learned that trying to save a few hundred dollars (on website software, marketing tools, etc.) often costs you far more in the long-run. My business is still highly profitable… 80%+ profit margin… just because of the nature of the business. But I always look for ways to invest and buy the best tools/resources for myself. It’s worth it. ‍",1,0
29," I think the single biggest mistake we made from which we did not recover was the “Uber mentality”, which was growth at all cost and ignore any regulations. In building up our food production and distribution process, we should have consulted with the health department early on. We should have paid a private consultant to come in and do an audit for us. Early warning on this would have provided us with ample time to try different distribution models and adjust accordingly. Instead, we were hit with an abrupt shutdown order and as the result could not muster any resources in the short term to make operational changes.  But we didn’t consult anyone. Because we were inspired by Uber and Airbnb to just ignore the regulators. On top of this, there were a bunch of other mistakes in hindsight which, although did not directly cause Chowdy’s demise, all contributed to it: Our pricing was way too low. So low that we basically made no profit over the 2 and half years we ran Chowdy. So low that we didn’t have any resources in reserve to help us deal with unexpected emergencies. Not getting funding. This again relates to the question of resource. When the health department issue came up, we literally had no money to deal with it. If we had outside funding this may have turned out differently. Not having contingency plans for a lot of situations. It wasn’t just the health department issue - we were constantly going from one emergency to another. I barely devoted any time on growing the business after the 2nd year because there were so figurative fires I had to put out, from water getting cut off in our facility, to hub shutting down, to employees walking out.  No risk management. I never sat down and analyzed what were the major risk areas our business faced, partly because I spent all my time in the weeds of running the operations and handling the emergencies. In retrospect, there were so many parts of our business that were very fragile and would break at the slightest disruption. The health department issue that led us to shut down was really just a manifestation of this. ‍ In terms of the challenges we faced along the way but eventually overcome, there were so many. I’ll give 3 examples: The first challenge was ingredient sourcing. We started with buying ingredients ourselves from local supermarkets. We would rent a car on production days, drive to cheap Chinese supermarkets, and buy 1-2 shopping carts worth of ingredients. After about 3 months our volume became way too big for us to shop for ourselves. Additionally, I realized we were not taking advantage of our volume to get discounts on the ingredients. That’s when someone explained to me how restaurants get their ingredients from national distributors like Sysco and GFS. With that, I reached out to a bunch of these suppliers through their websites. Initially, I didn’t get any response back. I then called them directly and was able to meet with some of their reps to figure out how we can buy ingredients from them. The next problem was the facility. We were using our cook’s home kitchen in the beginning. But very quickly that became unfeasible as we learned that it’s illegal to use home kitchen for commercially sold food. Also, home kitchens are simply not equipped with all the specialized and expensive equipment that commercial restaurants use for volume production (like a convection oven and tilt skillet). So we looked around for any commercial kitchens we can rent for cheap. At one point we had the idea to partner up with nightclubs, which are all legally required to have commercial kitchens but they rarely use them. We were able to get a couple of nightclubs to agree to let us use their kitchens for cheap, but this turned out to be a big mistake as we found out that these kitchens were woefully under-equipped and not very clean (we had 2 hires walk out on us because of it). Eventually, we found a newly-started hourly rental kitchen that was clean and had everything we needed. We stayed there for 2 years until we eventually took over a restaurants space and converted it to a dedicated kitchen space. The biggest problem, though, was staff. I learned pretty quickly that the type of people I was hiring was so different from the corporate type I used to work with at the consulting firm. In the food industry, every one job hops every few months and it was extremely tough to retain good and reliable people. We offered above-market hourly wages, yet we were not able to keep anyone for longer than a few weeks. And because our production team was so small, losing even a single person caused significant disruptions for us. There were so many days when my partner and I had to personally jump in to help with dishwashing and deliveries because we were so short staffed. This problem never fully went away, but we eventually grew to a scale that we were able to have a full-time head chef, who basically managed all the hiring for us. ‍",0,0
30," We’re in a very competitive space. Therefore, one of the challenges we face is making our value proposition and differentiating from some of the more established tools that are out there, like Slack communities and Facebook groups. Another of the challenges is helping our creators have engaged communities and have members to interact between them. A lot of times, online communities can lead to ghost towns. Therefore, we help our creators build active communities that are valuable for their members. ‍",1,0
31," Again, it all depends on what stage you’re at. Initially, it’s finding out whether this whole thing could even work. At first, most airlines just jerked us around and wouldn’t pay, so we had no idea what to do. Over time we built some legal know-how, got people with a legal profile on board and began collecting money. Then we nearly ran out of money, so had to fundraise. Then our unit economics broke as we tried scaling - spending more on customer acquisition, but lagging behind in collecting that revenue, etc. Then there’s scaling tech, people, operations, etc. There’s always something.   Not sure if that’s a disadvantage, rather than a reality for any business, really, but we’re in somewhat a competitive space. The barrier to entry is seemingly low and anyone who can build a landing page and drive traffic feels like they’ve got what it takes to run this business. Luckily, that’s not how it works.  One of the greater mistakes, if I can even call it that, is perhaps that we were a bit naive - travel and especially distribution in travel is an unbelievably consolidated space, which makes incumbents sit rather comfortably and a nightmare for a small startup to try to do something differently.  We’ve also spent money on useless things. Be it failed marketing campaigns, hiring the wrong person, building something that has no real application or shipping it half-baked, so again - it has no real application - the classical stuff.  ",1,0
32," The number one obstacle for me was pushing through burnout and cranking through another product launch. It’s still remarkable to me that functionally I didn’t do anything different than other ideas that failed to take off. Other than “Build something people want”, it’s hard to reconcile that you can do everything right and have a $0 outcome. Another one was not trusting my co-founder Mikey completely. I’m an operator and so is he. I tend to take control and go do what I think is right, and that doesn’t leave much room for other people to be comfortable enough to do the same. It’s a strange thing to start something and quickly give up control to someone else, but it was the right move. Seeing the hunt for a great CEO play out poorly at the venture studio, I decided to do it early and it worked but was an uncomfortable process. Thanks for your patience, Mikey! I made the mistake of being too flexible with customers. The cadence of this business is hard to manage. We took on several customers that would frequently “pause” campaigns. It made billing annoying and lumpy. ",1,0
33," The biggest challenge has been in taking personal time away from the business. The success of the business is something that's constantly on my mind, trying to figure out how can I make it better and how can I serve the clients. It’s like my baby. For me, this has meant a struggle to take time for me personally and away from the business. I've gotten better at doing this since joining a mastermind coaching group with other entrepreneurs. This has been the greatest tool and investment that I've made for myself!  The only disadvantage that I can think of is that our status in this industry is only within Colorado, which can make it difficult to get as clients companies that aren’t only located here or those companies who like our services but would also need it in other places of the country. The only mistake that I can think of is that I haven’t allowed anyone to join us as a partner. A good mutual friend of mine got involved for some time. The problem is friendships and business are totally different things and in our situation, it didn't work and a friendship I had for many years changed forever because of our business. Stacy and I decided because of this experience that we wouldn't take on a partner or anyone else wanting to buy into our business, not understanding or seeing the vision that we have had from the beginning. It's really hard to give someone a stake in your business when they’ve only seen what it is now and not having been there when you made the struggle, when you didn't have a paycheck and when you had to pour everything into the business. ‍",1,0
34," There were lots, but the one that stands out is our footwear factory closures in Afghanistan. Our plan was to leverage the boot contracts won by the factories to cover the overhead while we built up the footwear line. Unfortunately, the factories lost their contracts during our first run. We had thousands of pairs of footwear material and no place to make it. With no money and a basic idea of the construction process, the team built a guerilla flip flop factory in my garage and Andy got carpel tunnel syndrome sanding 8,000 individual flip flops. In spite of the fear, lack of knowledge, and no money--we delivered. Since then, we’ve moved our footwear production to Bogota, Colombia. CFF textiles are made in Afghanistan. Jewelry made from recovered landmines is made in Laos. T-shirts and other items are made in the United States. Fail. Learn. Improve. Repeat. ‍  We fell for a lot of the digital marketing company hype. If you have any kind of success or media, you expect your inbox to be full with “digital marketing experts” that guarantee a 10x ROI, 400% increase in sales, and unicorns on payday. Most of the time, these are people that worked in an agency, learned how simple the process is, and decided to go it on their own. You’ll see great metrics and references from one or two of their customers in the sales call, get excited, then invest a great deal of time getting them integrated into your digital environment. After a few months, you’ll be lucky to see an increase in direct platform return. By the time you add in their services fees, you’re making a lot less than if you were doing it on your own. I’m not saying all digital marketing companies are illegitimate, but it’s really tough to discern the players from the ballers on the sales calls. To date, we have yet to find a company that can generate returns from advertising better than our internal team. Spend the time on Youtube tutorials, find your market, generate your own ads, and measure your returns at a low level, then scale. We’re of the belief that “you miss all the shots you don’t take.” We’ve taken plenty of shots with online partners and missed. As a business owner, you should learn how this works, grow your system until you can hire a dedicated team member, then scale. ‍",1,0
35," One of the biggest mistakes that I made was not finding the right “balance” of planning and doing. I think as entrepreneurs, this is a challenge that you’ll consistently face. Although everybody might tell you to be executing every day, if you’re executing towards an overall plan that is not sustainable, your “execution” is pretty irrelevant. One particular example was when I thought I had to learn Javascript and more advanced languages when I was pivoting towards a freelancing platform. The learning curve for me to learn these languages was very difficult. I wasted about 2 weeks “executing” towards something that I thought had meaningful value.  Another challenge was a competitor, particularly GenM. We were different than GenM in the sense that we paid our students and apprentices, however, what I really respect about GenM is that they were able to prioritize their revenue stream and incentivize business owners/entrepreneurs to provide a healthy, economic supply and demand marketplace from my perspective. By also charging a small price to business owners (compared to where we charged approximately market value), GenM was able to differentiate themselves on price and have a niche market of bootstrapping business owners, while we didn’t necessarily have a niche. Another challenge was that our team was not software developers, and we were working towards a SaaS platform at one point to connect students and businesses. However, we again had to learn languages like C++ to try to attempt and build a platform of this complicated structure and we were not the right personnel for this.  A combination of these mistakes was a waste of most of the time and the lack of prioritization. If I could go back, instead of learning software development languages, I would put more effort into finding more profitable revenue streams to tackle local businesses and use no-code stacks (Webflow, Zapier, Parabola, Bubble) to develop my MVP. I had no idea about visual programming during this state, and could definitely see how this would save a ton of time and money during this period. ",0,0
36," I think we’ve been fairly lucky in this regard. I can’t think of any major things we’ve had to deal with. Some things used to get me really worried, like a competitor releasing a new feature or someone saying something negative. These kinds of things just don’t get to me anymore. I’ve learned there’s just no point in letting them upset you. You just deal with it and move on. The one thing that definitely still gets to me are the periods of slow, or even negative growth. It might only be a few days, maybe a week, but it definitely affects mood. Logically, all you have to do is zoom out and realize everything is still moving in the right direction. ‍  The biggest mistake by far was not being careful enough on feature selection when building our MVP. We rolled too many things into the first version which blew out our development budget. We spent way too much on our MVP. If I had to do it again, I’d pull out everything that wasn’t absolutely necessary, and work more closely with the development team to make sure we were all on the same page. The other big one is probably keeping our web design business going at the same time. It’s hard to call this a mistake because I’m still not sure if it was the right or wrong decision. The original idea was to keep building websites so that we had the additional income to keep us going, and so that I still had my finger on the pulse of the industry. That way I could write posts and make videos that helped out our target audience - so education-based marketing. I’ve since realized that one bad client can eat a whole week of my time (plus the team’s time) that could have been spent on Content Snare. I also realized we can work with other people to provide education to our users through guest posts. They’re experts at what they do. That means they write things way better than I could have and get some traffic and SEO juice at the same time. Truthfully, we probably should have dropped web design sooner. ‍",1,0

38," Bugs works in mysterious ways. Once, we lost a significant partnership deal because of the random sequence of bugs when our potential partner was testing our product. They postponed the partnership for one year, yet we still needed to pay half a fee. Core takeaway: develop a robust testing system as soon as possible. Human errors also work in mysterious ways. We are such losers sometimes, like that one time when we launched a marketing campaign with the wrong URL as a call to action :) Core takeaway: invite your family and friends to click everything clickable before launching anything. Bad investor's deals work in disguise. Core takeaway: a) hire only those lawyers who understand how startups work b) don't hesitate to ask for help from fellow founders.  Investor soft commitment is not done deal. We have experienced investors retreating from the deal at the very last minute of finalizing the investment round. Core takeaway: don't stop pitching until the money is in the bank account. Also, remember It's okay to break up life's full of failed relationships and full of new opportunities. ",1,0
39," Cristina: Being a new insurance company with an innovative offering, we faced an initial distrust & misunderstanding about our products. Customers buying auto insurance in Mexico are used to being sold their policies face to face from an insurance agent.  Changing this mindset was our first obstacle as customers were not used to buying intangible products by themselves, let alone from their mobile phones. Fortunately, digital natives have been our most frequent adopters, and they are helping us spread this new model via word of mouth. This is why we are looking for ways to keep incentivizing and rewarding them. Arnoldo: Another challenge has been finding new ways to invest in our growth. Being a small player in the industry means we have a limited budget to compete with already established insurance companies with substantial marketing budgets that allow them to invest heavily in national media & PPC campaigns. In our case, we have to be super creative and efficient. This is why we are investing in our long-term growth by focusing heavily on inbound & content marketing. We know this will take some time, but it will be way more cost-effective for us in the long run. This does not mean we do not invest in PPC campaigns. We do, but with laser focus and constantly iterating to learn and build upon that knowledge. ",1,1
40," Signups weren't a problem, or so I thought. I ended up getting 50 signups per month for four months in a row. The challenge was to get active users. It took a while to get to the aha moment. You needed to use it each day for a week or two weeks before getting the aha moment. That's painful. Users will never get that far. ‍",0,0
41," Our biggest obstacle has been creating a brand new product and sport with very little money in the bank. Being patient, when you have this crazy idea, was tough for us. We wanted to get a million nets out there and send them to everyone, but financially that was simply not realistic. We did not want to bury ourselves in so much debt, where we were working for the first two-three years simply to recoup our losses. We started small, purchased 100 nets, sold them and rebought 200. Now we’re buying in 7500 unit increments. It’s an awesome feeling.    Our worst mistake was launching our company and accepting orders before we had our final product and enough inventory in our warehouse. We’d bring our prototype to the beach and dozens of people would have an absolute blast playing it. We’d then direct them to the site where they’d purchase with the understanding that they’d receive their order in a few weeks. In the beginning, a few weeks turned into a few months, and that was our first experience with how important having good customer service was.  I always tell fellow entrepreneurs to make sure you 100% have your inventory in before you start selling or to properly set customer expectations for the absolute worst. Customers won’t complain about getting their order earlier, but they certainly will about getting it late. We now pride ourselves on having a 48 hour turn-around time and getting almost every order that arrives before 5 PM EST out of the warehouse on the same day.  ",1,0
42," I mentioned the coupons, right? 😅 The biggest challenge has probably been how difficult it is to forecast work accurately. This won’t come as a surprise to anyone working on a technical product, but stuff always takes longer than you think. I had expected to finish this course in 3-4 months when in reality, it will have taken more than a year of full-time work. I’m reminded of Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take Hofstadter's Law into account. If you think something will take 2 weeks, so you give yourself 4 weeks, it’ll probably take 8 weeks. ",1,0
43," My biggest mistakes were (a) building the app based on a business model rather than an audience, (b) making a strategic error on the launch platform that cost us extremely valuable earned media, and (c) being the wrong CEO for the company. I already addressed (a) and (b) above, but being the wrong CEO for the company was very important learning. One thing that I think we did right is to build the company on a foundation of values and hold ourselves accountable to them. These were ours: Everything we do starts and ends with people.We always consider our users first.We are all team players.We are humble and self-critical.We communicate openly and honestly.We solve problems, not create them.We deliver on our promises. Following the values of communicating openly and honestly and solving problems, not creating them, we’d have very deep conversations. Bear in mind that Pinguino, Steve, and I have all known each other for over 15 years, and we were all good friends before we started Cuddli, so we were uniquely positioned to do this. But we were also all older, and I think this helped a lot--we were more mature. There was a point in the company where it became obvious that my marketing initiatives were gaining limited traction, Pinguino’s user acquisition initiatives were gaining considerable traction, and the most important thing our company needed to do was get users, not do MBA stuff with business models. I stepped aside as CEO and moved into a supporting role as COO and chairman of the board. Pinguino stepped up as CEO, and the fact that she did kept the company alive for another two years. ",0,0
44," Obstacles?! Plenty. The most current obstacle we are all struggling to overcome- Corona. But before all of this, my main developers went out of business, I had to migrate servers multiple times, and my wife and I welcomed our second son. But CuriousCheck has persevered.  Our goal is still the same - to simplify and provide a platform for business advancement.  We bring transparency and knowledge to a space often overlooked, because people tend to stay stagnant in their way, regardless of how technology evolves.  We understand the thought of uprooting and starting over can be hard, but we make it as easy as possible and even exciting.  ‍  I don’t believe I had any great disadvantages at all. It’s what you do with the cards you’re dealt with.  My worst mistake was not researching how to have a React-based APP optimized for SEO.

45," Customer service is definitely something I struggled with in the beginning. I was not used to dealing with angry customers especially when I saw their complaints as unreasonable. Over time I learned that it was best to ‘take the hit’ on these types of customers as they are not worth stressing over. Moreover, if a dissatisfied customer leaves a bad review online it will likely cost the company future revenues far in excess of refunding a partially refunding a customer. It’s important to leave your ego at the door in the service industry and act in the best interest of your business at all times.",1,0
46," Our single biggest challenge was (and continually is), finding and reaching the correct people who are prepared to take action on our products and services.  We were a “business” for two years before we found any type of traction anywhere.  We were so slow for a number of months in the beginning that we simply stopped updating anything.  I would stop paying attention to the site entirely until an order came in, get reinvigorated and write some content, do some outreach, etc,  get discouraged, and stop paying attention. That cycle was on repeat through the first two years. We finally broke through with a feature in Huffington Post.  I had been bugging this comedy writer-at-large at daily for a couple of weeks until she finally gave up and featured our product.  That was our “big break” (read: we saw this could be something profitable and real).  From that article, we received something like 30 orders which gave us some cash flow to play with. I rolled that into a marketing budget and we were off to the races...so to speak. Of course, there are also always challenges with summer seasons.  We are a delivery chocolate service.  High temperatures mean melted chocolate and people who are none too pleased. Our solutions are always a work in progress.  However, we have minimized melting by shipping more quickly, shipping in thermal envelopes designed to keep contents cool, and including ice packs during the hottest times of the year. We still get a good handful of melty dick emails though.  We can’t control someone who leaves a package in the direct sunlight in Atlanta for three hours in July.  Just going to have to roll with the punches and understand that will happen. ‍  Our single biggest mistake has been underestimating our audience. We honestly never believed this would have been something to be successful. it was always just two friends having fun messing with our friends. That means we went far too long not having a good email list built, no marketing, no real work went into building the foundations of the company. If I had to do it all over again, I would start with a solid website, strong email list builder, and bigger outreach to prospective audiences. I would have gone after more social platforms (Twitter, FB, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, etc) to gain the audience we were looking for. Behind those early days mistakes, I would have invested in the chocolate making process much sooner. We spent a couple years bootstrapping all our equipment which proved to be much more expensive (in the long run) and time-consuming. ‍",1,0
47," Again, the biggest mistake by far was that we spend >80% of our resources developing something very few people needed. I was aware of the concept of the lean startup, but I didn’t know how to put it into practice and how you can take it to an extreme in order to improve the chances of finding the elusive product-market-fit. IMO the most important thing for a startup by far is to be lean and agile. It seems to me that if you fail at any of the two you’re very likely to waste your time and money, as we did. You need to be able to challenge, test, and if required change your assumptions as cheaply as possible in order to give yourself the best chance to find the right approach. It’s wise to start serious investments in development and marketing only after you have tangible evidence you’re on the right path. Besides that, there were many other problems, mistakes, and learning experiences along the way. For example, I’d avoid doing another startup as a solo founder. I think a co-founder is extremely beneficial. I’d also avoid doing another startup without a mentor. That said, I don’t think those are true for everyone – they are negotiable, case-specific, and they have pros and cons. Being lean and agile, however, is simply non-negotiable. There are no downsides besides the fact that it requires more effort on the side of the founder(s), but this is well worth the increase in the chances of success.",0,0
48," The biggest challenge I faced as an entrepreneur wasn’t the marketplace, my clients, prospects or a difficult Facebook ads campaign. It was my own mindset. Developing the mental toughness/grit to handle the inevitable obstacles, challenges and difficulties of entrepreneurship. Forcing myself to get rid of the “scarcity” mindset ( don’t take risks and seek safety ), and develop a “growth” mindset ( take calculated risks and get out of your comfort zone ). Developing the confidence to not listen to naysayers & doubters ( especially people around me who told me to go get a safe job ). Not quitting even when things weren’t going well. Having the patience to think long-term and delaying gratification.   I would say that one of our greatest disadvantages is the fact that our industry is getting over-saturated with low-quality consultants/service-providers.  We have many of our prospective clients tell us that they’ve had very bad experiences with consultants, which makes them skeptical of working with another one.  We counteract this by putting extra attention on building trust/credibility with our prospects as well as having a fantastic background of social proof. The mistake I made in the beginning of this business was not investing enough back INTO the business. That limited our growth greatly at first and it took me time to mature & understand the necessity of investing back into the company for long-term growth. ‍",1,0
49," I’m fortunate in that I’m involved in content creation, so it’s difficult to make mistakes, per se. The one thing I wish I had more of is to promote my products more aggressively.  My email list is probably half the size that it could be today because I did not do the work of heavy promotion early on. I’ve easily left six figures of revenue on the table because I did not promote as heavily.  The big thing I’ve learned is that if you’re in business for yourself, you live and die by promotion and marketing. One of the big changes I’ve made recently is that I promote my content much more heavily now than I ever have before. This has resulted in more sales, signs ups, and visitors. All of those are excellent outcomes for my brand. ‍",1,0
50," I’ve made so many mistakes along the way that I’m not super proud of. I'll mention some of the main operational and personal obstacles with building Embarque. I'll start with the operational ones. First off, creating a hiring pipeline for skilled writers, fact-checkers, and editors is really, really hard. If a working relationship does not pan out, then you're back to square one in the hiring process, which can easily last for more time than you want.  I have encountered several issues related to hiring that I had never expected to happen. Here are a few off the top of my head: Writers using plagiarized or spun content. We've caught a writer hired through referral spinning content from various sources, and I was not ready to tackle this issue when it happened. It ruined a relationship with a bootstrapper whose work I greatly admired. Oh, well. Since then, we've doubled down on our fact-checking efforts and implemented a zero-tolerance policy for all types of plagiarism, including duplicate content and content spinning. A candidate submitted a portfolio full of content written by a GPT-3 tool. No joke. This only happened once, but I was shocked by how the person thought they could get away with it. I'm confident that people who can't distinguish good writing from bad would be easily fooled by this.Writers not meeting tight deadlines. An added issue of being a remote-first company is having employees who will ghost you if they don't meet deadlines or expectations.  Hiring can still be a struggle. At Embarque, we have a certain quality that we want to uphold. The content marketing industry is tough. One poorly written article can instantly sour a long-term relationship with a client. We need great writers who can follow guidelines, are proactive, and can think clearly and strategically. These qualities allow us to compete against other agencies that promise similar results at significantly higher price points.  As for my personal obstacles, I decided to pursue a Master's program that I ended up not liking, and it took a lot of time and energy that I could have spent on building Embarque. There were times when I had to decline large orders because I had too much coursework to do.  This will probably sound cliché, but the biggest issue I face is taking care of my mental health. I struggle with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD). I have a history of substance abuse mainly attributed to BPD. That said, these very issues mean that I can be obsessive towards achieving things and can do 15-hour workdays without much of a break. The lockdown has helped me focus on work, but I hope I won't regress once everything opens up again. Finally, being a first-time founder, I can get into my head quite often and find myself procrastinating on things out of fear of not doing them well enough. I've learned some prioritization techniques to ensure that I do the tasks that move the needle forward. ‍",1,0
51," The challenge in growing emit is being in a place where the minimum order quantity from our manufacturers is 1000 units which is not much for them, but needing to raise around $45k from Kickstarter which is a large amount for a project with very little market spend. We have had to bootstrap a lot of the marketing, outreach to PR and customers, as well as create the creative assets to showcase emit. It's an exhilarating experience as we get to learn incredible amounts every day, and have to learn to be rapid and decisive but also thoughtful with our actions. Being a recently graduated student, there is always the pressure of pursuing a traditional corporate career with big names and high starting salaries. It is initially difficult to express your vision with a business especially when it has not yet started generating revenues. Our hardest challenge so far has been raising funds by exhausting our list of friends and family as our initial group of backers. Apart from being very time intensive as you have to manually reach out to them, it also involves a lot of awkward conversations and unfortunately strained relations too. To the personal relations who do back you, you now have the added pressure of delivering a successful product as it puts your trustworthiness at stake. On the other hand, it also drives us to work even harder to make a success out of emit. ‍  In terms of mistakes, we started by asking what now looks like really basic questions about manufacturing to our manufacturers. We have had a very steep learning curve about the process so far. We also realized that spending money on Facebook ads ought to be done with much more tight goals (metrics) as otherwise, you can be fiscally very irresponsible in the chase of acquiring customers. We have learned to set a fixed customer acquisition cost and divvy up the different strategies that we will spend on to trying to acquire a customer. We are also improving our outreach and media assets in quality with every piece of content we release. We have become clearer on wanting to only produce content that is valuable to our community instead of pure ads as it builds a stronger sense of service for us. We have also become more disciplined in prioritizing goals and milestones instead of trying to do a bunch of different things at once with diluted effort. We started off by wanting to only show countdowns on the watch, but user feedback led us to quickly incorporate normal time, heart rate monitoring and footsteps as well. We did this to balance being a purely time keeping device with the minimal functions needed to convince a user to have an emit on their wrist. This was probably our biggest pivot - but we stay true to our core of wanting to change a user’s behavior with time by always showing them some form of time. ‍",1,0
52," As an early stage startup, the obvious challenge is validating that people actually want to use your product.  As a pre-launch tool, we are still not 100% confident that the feature set we have on our roadmap is the right one, but we do our best to minimize the risks. In a more personal aspect, I’d say the biggest obstacle for me is balancing my client consulting work with the startup.  As a bootstrapped pre-launch company, I still don’t have the luxury to work full-time on Encharge. Right now, I’m consulting 2 days a week while spending the rest on Encharge. It’s challenging to juggle between projects, but I do my best to tackle it by having a very organized schedule and a daily to-do list. ‍  One of our advantages is also one of our biggest disadvantages – the marketing automation market is extremely saturated. There are dozens if not hundreds of decade-old gorillas like ActiveCampaign and Mailchimp. It’s scary because these guys have built a huge barrier to entry and compete on relatively low price points. We still believe that no one is solving the marketing connectivity problem good enough, so there is room for tiny players like us with a unique positioning angle.  Before starting with Encharge, we made the mistake of not sticking with a single product for long enough. We were jumping from project to project and not giving them enough of a chance, discarding any ideas that don’t receive positive feedback within 10 customer development interviews or less. Another mistake we made was not relying on our strengths and interests enough. We tried to validate ideas in markets that we weren’t very interested enough or require skills beyond our core skill set. Before moving forward with Encharge, we jotted down specific criteria for the type of startup we want to work on: Big, horizontal categoryA lot of existing competitors (saturated market)Something that excites both of usSomething that we have experience withB2BSelf-serve mode – Something that we can sell from a website ‍",1,0
53," My bandwidth has been our biggest obstacle to growth. In addition to my full-time job running my consulting practice, I am also a doctoral candidate completing my dissertation, have a toddler at home, and have been recovering from surgery. So I can't always dedicate the focus I'd like, which is part of why I need to be strategic about what's needed if we are to attempt to grow this fall.  Beyond that, I’ve made a few tangible mistakes along the way. I’ve spent the money I allocated to marketing inefficiently I tried a few different approaches just to see what would stick and many of them didn’t. We tried a tiered pricing strategy, created some less-than-perfect-looking online ads, and we hired a marketing consultant to put together a plan that wasn’t any good.  ‍",1,0
54," At the beginning of this year, we were in the process of closing our largest funding round. Things were looking good for the Summer. Then, lockdown was announced. Though the round was approaching completion, it hadn’t finalised. That’s when disaster struck. We received an email from our lead investor saying that they were out. We called an emergency board meeting at 11:30pm on a Thursday night, trying to work out what the hell we were going to do.  We only had 2 weeks of runway left, and we had to somehow turn that into a year. One of our investors suggested that we choose 1 of our 9 employees to keep. That was a hard thing to hear. We came up with a few options to pursue, but we didn’t have much time. It was with a heavy-heart we called the team meeting that day to announce the current situation. The initial response from the team was phenomenal, something neither me or my co-founder, Callum, could have possibly predicted or asked for. Everyone rallied. People offered to take pay cuts or no pay. We didn’t ask them to do that. Thanks to an incredibly solid effort from Callum and overwhelming support from the team, we managed to navigate through 2020. Somehow, though, we didn’t just “hang on” as a business, we grew. Quite substantially, actually. This is one of the biggest obstacles we've overcome as a business. As a startup we will encounter countless more, and if this taught me something, it is to treasure the team and the support we give each other through the good times and the bad. ‍",1,0
55," Building the platform quickly and cheaply. Using the .NET stack, I found was too clumsy a way to build the platform. At least I found that was too inefficient. Maybe because of the complexity of learning each component in the stack. My current project is using MeteorJS and MongoDB. Took me less than a month to learn. ‍ What obstacles did you have? Convincing prospects to sign up. Keeping my partner’s spirits high.Your personal and your team disadvantages. ‍ Were there any disadvantages in the market of Eventloot? Event planners are very busy. Wedding seasons make them virtually unreachable. The profession is not exactly established. There’s a range of commitment in that community. Some planners do it for fun others will quit in a couple years and then there are those that have an army of planners working for them. ‍ Did you have any disadvantages in comparison with your competitors? Our competitors were either very established or well-funded. ‍ Did you commit any mistakes? Building Eventloot without consulting with a customer. Initially building without designing the platform on paper. ‍ Did you make any mistakes that cost you time and/or money? We didn’t talk to the people we were building Eventloot for. As a result, we spent a lot of time building either the wrong thing or something they didn’t need. Hiring subpar freelancers initially and then having to find a replacement to redo their work. ‍ Were there any things that could have been made in a better way? Build Eventloot with MeteorJS and MongoDB. Roll out with an MVP that had core functionality that was absolutely useful to a planner. Consult with an established wedding planner at each stage of developing the app. ‍ Any missed opportunities? Working with wedding planners early on.",0,0
56," One challenge that I had run into that I didn’t previously consider is platform loyalty. It’s a royal pain in the ass to get people off the platform that they are already using and to get them to start using something else. There are a number of reasons why that is the case, but the most important one is that you are going directly against the platform’s investment of keeping their users right where they are. The Facebooks of the world invest hundreds of millions to make people stay in-app for as long as possible and actively work to discourage switching to a direct competitor or the use of alternatives. Another factor that made ExploreVR.net an impossible business was timing. Bill Gross says that timing is the single most important factor in the success or failure of a company. When I started ExploreVR.net I felt that the timing was spot on, but the more I got into the project the more I realized that I was about 2 years too late. Later on, I learned about the Technology Hype Cycle model (which I highly recommend that anyone working with emerging technologies studies) and it just crystalized exactly how late I was to the party. My gut tells me that if I built the same exact site two years prior, it would have been successful even in spite of every mistake I committed. That’s right, a better timing would have changed everything. Jumping in the same exact niche earlier would have given me the time to correct my mistakes. Very often it’s far more important to be first, to define the category. Two years ago, I would have had a shot at becoming the biggest site of its kind and delivering value to the users. But I entered the market too late, and as such couldn’t put together a compelling value proposition. As a wet behind the ears startup founder, I was out of touch with the element of timing. Finally, I’d like to point out one supposedly critical thing that was not a factor – money. I made a decision to be self-financed. To this day I firmly hold the belief that having or not having money doesn’t solve the fundamental business problems. Problems like, you know, your customers not wanting your product…. Would Plankton’s Chum Bucket be a big hit with Bikini Bottom residents if he had 10 branches and a $50 million dollars operating budget?  No, because he didn't sell Krabby Patties. Also, as the Founder and CEO, you need to be ready to handle money.  This is especially true if we are talking about outside capital.  What assurances do your investors have that you won’t just squander the cash on stupid stuff? Go and learn with your own money. The magnitude of the lessons learned when playing with your own cash on the line will make you into a stronger business person. You will learn just how irrational you can behave when there is skin in the game. Raising money when you have a solid product that customers want, and a management team that knows what they are doing is not a problem.",0,0
57," Having thought about this a lot I can put the mistakes that led to the failure of fantastic house buyers down to one main thing: not validating the idea before launching, unfortunately, this is something I should have realized at the outset. A lot of challenges can be overcome but not having a market for your product can only end one way! Having been through the start-up process I now realize how important it is to build something that is genuinely solving a significant problem for a significant amount of people. I set out to build a product that I thought I would want, and without a clear vision of the problem I was solving, and who I was solving it for, my chances of succeeding were very slim from the start. The great thing about this experience is that all I lost was time rather than a significant amount of money, instead of seeing this as time lost I see it as a valuable learning experience to take forward to my next venture. While marketing fantastic house buyers I spent an awful lot of time on Google Analytics, sometimes 1-2 hours a day trying to understand what my users were doing, how many were converting and where I needed to improve my marketing and sales funnel, or where I could potentially generate revenue through affiliate marketing. I was spending so much time on this that I built a visitor analytics function into the fantastic house buyers admin (I was already utilizing user tracking so it was essentially a rough and ready front end to show me the numbers and info I needed, rather than having to dig through GA and plug it into spreadsheets). While dissecting the failure of fantastic house buyers I realized that this was a pain point I had solved for myself and others may also want something like this so they can spend more time on their business and less time trying to gather the insight they need. This time, instead of worrying about the features and writing the code I’m fully validating the idea first. To do this I’ve put together some rough mock-ups of what I think the product would look like and have a landing page where people can sign up, I’ll only develop this further once I’ve hit a certain number of sign-ups and know that there is enough interest in my product. You can find the landing page here and I’d be really interested to hear what your readers think. (Note that I’ve not even committed to a product or domain name until I’ve validated the idea!) I also think there are a couple of secondary reasons fantastic house buyers failed, I think these could have been overcome but certainly didn’t help: Poor choice of the market: In hindsight, the UK property market is currently being disrupted by a number of online real estate agents which are significantly undercutting traditional estate agents. These currently only account for around 5% of the market and the remaining 95% is quite conservative and skeptical of technology that could reduce their income, making it very difficult to get traction. There is also a lack of online communities and influencers, with 2 huge property portals serving most consumer needs. For my next venture, I’m very much focusing on the tech/start-up world where I think there is a much more supportive community and an inherent culture of embracing new opportunities and products.Lack of industry experience: Again, I don’t think this an obstacle that cannot be overcome but choosing an industry I had no real knowledge or experience of for my first start-up only served to make it more challenging. While I don’t have a deep knowledge of the market for my next venture it is at least one I have experienced for myself and where I can better understand the challenges and problem I’m trying to solve from my customers point of view.",0,0
58," I think the biggest challenge was waiting a long time until the first paying customer. The team morale was not so good, so the first customer was a great event. For us, this brought validation that the product was desired.  Another challenge was when a key member of our team decided to leave the company before break even.  We also implemented too late a customer feature request, which would have added more value. Usually, we add extra features to the application if they make sense for the product and the customer pays for them. Those were hard times in the beginning, but we succeeded even with these challenges. ",1,0
59," With no background in software development and definitely very broke with no funds to hire a developer, I didn't know how I would build a platform by myself. I took up the challenge to research, read a lot of articles on website development, how to build an MVP, etc! Well, as they say, the rest is history.  Also, manually curating thousands of film festivals and carefully selecting the ones that are a perfect fit for Festivilia was a painstaking job. We spent a few months doing this. Well, it is still a painstaking job as we constantly research and add film festivals to our database.  One of our biggest mistakes was at the initial launch of Festivilia, we priced the service so low and this was a huge strain on us. We overpromised and in the bid to not disappoint our clients, we worked our ass off (Permit my language) to fulfill our promises. Because of this, we couldn't take any more clients for a few months for obvious reasons. If we had done that, we would have failed to deliver. This meant we lost money. Fast forward to today, we are happy we made such mistakes as this has helped refined our business model. I guess the popular saying “If you are not embarrassed with your product when you launched, then you launched too late” is true. ",1,0
60," We didn’t really think about the narrow market niche for Fibery till the official release. It took us 3 years to nail the niche and deliver something specifically for this niche. Overgeneralization may work if you have huge budgets, but if you don’t, then focusing on a niche is your only choice. I think this was the main mistake we made. We spent the first several months just prototyping and playing with various technologies. We manage to solve all major technological problems, but we may face more with growth. These are good problems to have, but I still wonder how Fibery will survive large 1000 people accounts in the future. The real challenge was a company separation. Fibery was an internal project first, and it was extremely hard to spin it off as an independent company. It took more than 2 years and endless negotiations. At some point, Fibery was close to death (and it was even announced to the team), but we survived, separated, and cleaned our cap table to get the seed round. I definitely don’t want to have this experience again. ",1,0
61," I’ve learned that you need to be very thorough throughout the hiring process. I’ve been lucky to hire many great intrapreneurs, employees, and freelancers over the years, but this was a learning curve. I used to be much freer in my approach to hiring and this didn’t always work out. Now I’m very clear about the people I want to work with, as they’re representing my business and need to have the same hard-working approach and vision I have or it just won’t work.  I try to see the mistakes of my team and me as learnings and something to be grateful for. Without them, we wouldn’t be where we are today. There are so many things I could have done differently from the start but we are all just doing the best with the information we have available at the time. Every CEO is a work in progress and I’m always reading and learning how to become the best leader I can be. ‍",1,0
62," The biggest challenge we faced was to build trust in an unorganized market. The efforts to organize have been haphazard, where complex skills are treated as a commodity that can be measured by usual marketplace dynamics such as ratings and reviews. The result is the core interests of all parties involved are compromised. When a company wants to hire a freelance developer or a designer for a particular job, they have to deal with a lot of noise, leading them to engage with sub-par/ not the best talent without having proper structures in place - thereby leading to a not-so-good experience. Increased competition and transparent pricing have not been able to solve this problem for these companies. Our consistent and unwavering focus on quality has helped us differentiate ourselves and build a reputation as a preferred talent partner in the market. We realized very early on that our community members are our core product, who have helped us garner a positive response. We continue to recognize this and have been working diligently to refine our screening process on a continuous basis. Today we are a community of 200+ such members with freelancers from 5 countries with diverse backgrounds and skill sets. They range from hardcore backend developers and the most complete full-stack ninjas to expert UX’ers andamazing illustrators who have worked at top tech-centric companies such as Ola, Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe and Goldman Sachs. Through such a high bar of quality, we are able to work with the best companies in the tech space and help solve their varied talent challenges through our community. On a personal front, wearing different hats and juggling multiple responsibilities has been a challenge I have been able to live up to. Over the past 6 months, apart from managing and delivering on my personal targets of meeting our revenue targets, I have been managing Flexiple’s finances, handling the hiring and onboarding process which saw us grow from a 4-member to a 9-member team within 6 months, and giving inputs whenever necessary on UX design.   The biggest disadvantage in the first year was that none of the three of us were especially good at tangible skills needed to grow and build Flexiple. While Hrishikesh is a core techie and had worked at Adobe and Amazon as a Software Engineer, it had been 2 years since he had last coded. Though, with our motivations aligning and immense efforts, all three of us are hands-on and to certain extent experts in a field, much-needed to grow Flexiple.  I have spent the last year or so, learning the nuances of sales and implementing them across both freelancer and client onboarding. At the same time, Hrishikesh has honed his product management capabilities while also getting back to being hands on with coding. And Karthik has taken to content marketing seamlessly and is our go-to-guy for everything relating to marketing. We still have a lot to learn as we need to improve upon our client conversion rates, our ability to meet product deadlines, and content distribution. However, the learnings we derived from the mistakes we made in the first year have us in good stead to ensure we do not repeat such costly mistakes and don’t let our goals blind us from understanding those of our customers. ",1,0
63," The biggest obstacle we overcame would be the ability to generate quality inbound traffic and as a result, good leads. None of us (the three co-founders) were active on social media or knew much about marketing. I just made my social accounts last year. Of course, one has to find the relevant channel for them to leverage, but in our case, we realized that just adding value on the mainstream social channels like Twitter and LinkedIn would help us grow our own business too. Also, learning SEO was critical but we started too late. For a couple of years, we wrote articles that were never optimized and therefore didn’t bring us any traffic. So, in all honesty, they were wasted efforts. We, of course, learned from our initial mistakes of building tech before actually needing it or understanding what to build. Since then, we have been gradually infusing it as we scale. Even now, ironically, all our tech is set up on NoCode tools as it gets the job done extremely well. ‍",1,0
64," One of the main challenges is hiring the right people. As an agency, we need to hire people who are creative and talented, can also work hard for quite a long period, and can jump from project to project.  I believe we were particularly slow in the hiring process and it is hindering our growth a bit for the moment, but it is important to hire the right people. We were intentionally slow, but in the coming months, we will start hiring worldwide for remote work.  Sometimes I can push at a speed that might be called premature scaling, and in the end, it can cost us a lot of money. Hopefully, Nastya and Davit, my co-founders, will show enough wisdom to counter my actions with common wisdom. This is the reason that I don’t like to start a business alone. ‍",1,0
65," The first one was working with an external provider. Because we had somebody else building it for us, we had to learn through that person. We didn't know what we were doing. It was very hard to iterate through those versions. We'd create a version, realize it was terrible. And then we will need to spend another $2,000 to completely rebuild the product. We were not even sure if this new version was going to work. We discovered paper prototyping and prototyping tools. I started getting into that. Another big challenge was monetization. We were trying to figure out what our product offered that people would be willing to pay for. ‍",0,0
66," I don’t want to dramatize my experience as I know there are many others who probably have gone through a lot to grow their business.  My biggest challenge was around this time last year. My newborn son was colic (i.e. - he would always cry for no obvious reason) and I was trying to balance my full-time day job alongside building Friday and keeping customers happy. Additionally, we were trying to sell our house and move to a new location. To make matters worse, I was renovating the new house on my own (flooring, trim, etc). It was one of the most stressful times of my life, but it taught me to be patient. With that being said, I’m so thankful that the season is done. It was brutal.   My biggest mistake was in the early days of product development. We had just closed our biggest customer and had just spent a bunch of time building out new features. Long story short, we onboarded them and it was a disaster. Notification emails were sent to the wrong customer, so people would see a “Bob completed an update” email, whereas Bob worked for a different company. That was massively embarrassing and in many ways a breach of customer trust. It was one line of code fix. If I had taken the time to QA a bit more, it’s possible we could have caught the issue. I really don’t like letting our customers down. I try to take this as seriously as possible and not take their trust for granted. My biggest mistakes are things I should have caught with a bit more time/effort/attention. ",1,0
67," The biggest obstacle we’ve had to overcome is time and resources (which is much the same for anyone starting!). It was only January this year that I went full-time on Frontend Mentor, and Mike only came on full-time this month. So we’ve been juggling building Frontend Mentor with our paid work for a couple of years! I had been working as a contractor, so I had more available hours to work on it. Whereas Mike has always been full-time elsewhere, so he could only manage the odd evening and weekend. This has meant we’ve both needed to be patient, but it’s also helped us get good at prioritizing the right work because of our lack of available time. Over time, the community has continued to grow, and it has picked up more and more pace as each month has gone by. In May, we surpassed 150,000 registered members on the site! Another obstacle we’re starting to see is copycat sites. Some of whom have copied our model and wording to a tee. It’s frustrating, but there’s plenty of room for other players in the space, and I’m all for competition and offering alternatives to the development community.  For anyone facing copycats or competitors launching, I’d recommend reading The Innovation Stack by Jim McKelvey. It offers a brilliant reminder that the small decisions you make through research, feedback, and gut instinct compound to create something truly unique. Others may try to copy, but as long as you’re clear on your vision, it will be hard to stop you. We’ve also turned down investment in favor of trying to build the company sustainably. We’ll see in time whether or not that’s a mistake! ",1,0
68," Managing a company of 25 people at 25 / 26 is fun but definitely challenging. Launching/growing your own business today requires total commitment, it’s nothing fancy for the first few years. 15 hour days, missing out on experiences with your friends and family because you have to work is not cool but it’s an investment towards your future and your company, if you keep remembering that you’ll be okay.  Like I’ve mentioned earlier one of our biggest challenges was hiring the right people at the right time, especially in the beginning we wanted to pretty much stretch ourselves as much as possible before hiring someone so we are 1000% sure that we need to fill that position.  Not hiring fast enough. You know, as a founder you think that you can do it all the first few months but that’s not true and I realized it the hard way after I had a minor burnout. The truth is that the faster your hire people to help you with the small tasks you can focus on growing your business.  Another mistake is hiring the wrong people. We didn’t have an HR manager or someone experienced in our team so it was 100% based on some key factors and our gut that lead to a couple bad hires throughout the years but looking at it from a percentage perspective our success rate is over 90% which is good.  ‍",1,0
69," This section could easily turn into a novel, so I’ll try to be brief! GawkBox was my first “proper” time as a founder & CEO. I went through a lot of firsts as CEO -- raising capital, reporting to investors, managing a board of directors, owning recruiting (both employees and board members), setting vision & owning company strategy… the list goes on. The first time that you do almost anything in life, you generally aren’t that great at it -- on the whole, I think starting and running a company is the same. It takes experience and practice to get better. As a CEO, I now realize that you have so many responsibilities, but you only have the same amount of time in the day as everyone else does. Layer in a young family, and it means you have to be extremely good at prioritization, time management, and decision making… and it is very hard.   I often prioritized the wrong things.  Sometimes I deprioritized having external conversations because I had other things on my plate: legal, health insurance, accounting…these are very important, but there are others who can take this responsibility from the CEO. This led me to have a suboptimal understanding of the market we were in -- I didn’t talk to enough customers or other companies in the ecosystem. Because I didn’t have a maniacal focus on the customer, it meant that we didn’t have an organization-wide customer-driven culture and in the end, it led to us not building a product that customers truly needed. By deprioritizing conversations with other companies in our space (competitors or potential partners), I didn’t have as good a picture of the live streaming ecosystem as I should have -- and also limited our strategic partnership options when I most needed them.  We could’ve invested our money more intelligently.  We may have found ourselves in a different scenario these past few months if we had been more frugal with our spending immediately after raising our last investment round. Flush with close to $4M in the bank and believing that we had the next billion-dollar business, we prematurely set about investing in growth -- just 3 months later we’d more than doubled the team and were spending an equal amount on sales & marketing as we were on engineering. However, at that point our product had shown only poor retention metrics -- so we spent more cash filling our leaky bucket up faster only for our churn to increase. We ramped our sales & marketing spend out of sync with our product development.",0,0
70," When I was in construction I was top of my industry. I was making more money than I could spend and had a comfortable position with strong growth prospects. I was not satisfied with being comfortable and made the hardest decision of my life to leave all that behind and start in a new industry.  When I was leading my construction organization we were winning and growing. When I left, two of my companies failed. It was hard. When I pivoted into tech I was a nobody with no experience, network or status. I spent two years before GenM launching product after product and failing every time. I was no stranger to failing, but this was different. I was failing on all fronts, for a long time and that had never happened to me before. Being ignorant in tech I grew my team without knowing if I had product-market fit. That forced me to sell real estate I owned to fund the company because it was pre-revenue and we did not have a clear product-market fit to raise capital. The product failed, and I was left with no more real estate and over a million dollars in losses. To add during this time my personal life was going downhill. Me and my wife separated and my father was in a coma from a heart attack. So here I was at the bottom of a new industry, failing for years, with 1+ million in losses, and alone. I wanted to quit and go back to construction. My wife at the time told me I would not succeed. My best friend and business partner in the construction organization told me I would not succeed. My family told me I would not succeed. If I quit now I would cede failure. To me failing is quitting. Until you quit, you have not truly failed, you are only losing. I grew up poor, fat, and ignorant. My family came to this country with nothing. I changed my life before and became a self-made millionaire, married the women of my dreams and was super fit I knew I could do it again. I was down, but not dead. As long as I could move, I would. With every step, I learned. With every step, I became stronger. I emptied my cup totally and cleaned my slate. I became a student again with unlimited potential. My forays into tech before GenM failed but they did teach me a lot and they did allow me to meet my future co-founders in GenM. This time things were different. This time we would follow the right process every step of the way. I would assume nothing and trust only what I knew deeply and what could be proven with data. Slowly we started winning again. One-win lead to another. Momentum shifted. My personal life became significantly better, my fitness increased, my business was doing better. Every day I come to work I guard my state of mind. I never want to feel or be in a position like I was again. That fear helps give me drive, but ultimately it was the knowledge that we could help millions that made me look beyond myself through all the pain and suffering it was finding my purpose that lifted me out of darkness  My greatest disadvantage for starting a tech company is being located in Ottawa Ontario. Proximity is power. I am far away from the tech mekka in the Bay area. That means less talent, funding, and scale. We found ways to overcome this and turn it into an advantage however if we build GenM in the Bay area first we likely have scaled sooner. My worst mistakes were not following the right process early on and hiring the wrong people. We managed to learn from this, but at a great cost. ‍",1,0
71," I should've done more marketing and hired sooner. Things could have grown faster. I didn’t pay myself a salary for 2 years. I wouldn't ever want to start a business from scratch like that again. That was super hard. It’s a struggle that most people have when they're on their startup for the first time. You see a few people who build something and make $500,000 in the first year, but chances are they either got lucky or had an existing audience. I want to build something that's sustainable long-term. I'm not trying to build upon the current hype. Many bootcamps have raised tons of venture capital, and they tried to grow fast, and after a few years, they shut down and have to let go of all their employees. Everything depends on the product that you build. I built 3 very different products. Right now, I publish a screencast every week on GoRails, which is a time commitment. Then I have the hosting service, Hatchbox, an even bigger time commitment with less ROI than the others. And then the business template, JumpstartRails, which is probably the best ROI for the time that I give it. It's been fascinating to see those, compare them, and figure out where I want to invest my time.  The more your product is critical to the day-to-day operations of someone else's business, the more critical it is that you have perfect response times for support. Other products may grow slower but don't require hardly any support. Totally different businesses or products to run. It's been interesting to find a balance between all three that have different demands. ",1,0
72," I think the two biggest mistakes I made with Graphite were focusing on the wrong market and shipping without validation. I talked a little bit about the wrong market problem, but let me go into a little more detail.  I am good at b2b customer service, account management, and sales. Getting in front of businesses and trying to sell Graphite was never a problem. I managed to get in front of CNN, Buzzfeed, high-profile NGOs, law firms, and medical clinics. So, the problem wasn’t in generating leads. It was entirely in not understanding the product’s fit within the market I was trying to sell to. Businesses don’t want individual ownership of documents and files. They don’t want absolute control of user accounts in the hands of employees. I tried to fit Graphite into their box, but it was never a good fit. The encryption and protections were always the main selling points, but those benefits were tightly coupled with the things businesses didn’t want. Top that off with the complexity I mentioned earlier, and the b2b path was just flat-out the wrong approach. A quick anecdote to the complexity:  I had done a product demo for an NGO. Most of the staff was on the call, and the goal of the call was onboarding them to a pilot that would eventually convert into my first big paying customer. As part of the onboarding, my goal was to walk them through all the enterprise-specific features they’d be getting that the free accounts didn’t have. We never made it that far. It took 45 minutes for a single person in the organization to create a user account and understand how to manage that account. That experience was the beginning of the end for me.  The second challenge that I think I was able to overcome, but probably too late, was shipping without validation. I first built Graphite as a Google Docs alternative, but I soon convinced myself that it should be a full office suite. I built a terrible spreadsheet app, a file storage app, a Google Forms alternative, and even started on a slideshow app. Build all of these various apps and packaging them into the Graphite offering was distracting. I didn’t focus on my existing users as much as I should have, and I wasn’t able to improve the core product—the documents—fast enough because I was always building and shipping some unvalidated features or product.  I reigned this in, but it was probably too late by then. There’s actually a branch in the Graphite GitHub that was going to be the next generation of Graphite where it was only a documents app again. But as it stands, the final product that users saw was documents and file storage.  I was fortunate that Graphite’s overhead was very low (I sunk almost every dollar of grant money into marketing expenses, not infrastructure), so these mistakes didn’t cost me money. They cost me something more, though. Opportunity.  ‍",0,0
73," The biggest challenge was just starting in the stage of 0 to 1. So this included everything: marketing, product, development, etc. Not having social proof (having to build that up from scratch), not having a product that solved any customer use-cases (having to rebuild that from the ground up for one year). Everything in this process was a learning experience. So overcoming obstacles just took a lot of time. We would improve marketing and product reactively, digging for improvements at the roots. The biggest mistake was having a generic SaaS product and compromising on the product. This translated to 0 customers for us. ",1,0
74," The start was definitely the hardest. I was extremely close to quitting and just calling this another failed side project during that first month. The biggest struggle for me, as I mentioned before, was selling. I’m naturally a very introverted person and getting on the phone with people (and facing rejection) 5+ times a day was draining at the start. But I am extremely thankful I pushed through it. I feel much more outgoing and articulate (not just on the phone but in real life too) now that I have the practice and have almost no anxiety getting on the phone now. In terms of personal life, there were definitely low points. It’s difficult to wake up early, work on your business, go to your day job, and then come home and work on your own business more. Especially when things aren’t going as you planned. And while I can look back now and see a lot of my hard work paid off, it didn’t always feel that way. There were times where I questioned why I was spending all my free time on this when I was still in college. I should be having fun! Relaxing! I think anyone who builds their own side projects knows the feeling. But ultimately you stick with it for the same reason you started: because you enjoy it. I can say with near 100% certainty that I would not give up being an entrepreneur or a business owner for anything else.  I, like a lot of other entrepreneurial-minded people, suffer from an inability to delegate. I love learning to do everything myself. I taught myself to build and design websites just so I wouldn’t have to hire someone to do it for me. Unfortunately, this mindset is also limiting in a lot of ways. As a business owner now, I feel like I should be focusing on more high-impact areas of my business rather than spending hours tweaking the CSS on my site. Learning how to delegate and properly hire is definitely an obstacle I still need overcome if I want to grow my business. I’ve turned down projects which in retrospect could have been good gigs just because I felt like I didn’t have time for them. But, if I had hired people to take care of certain aspects of my business (mainly campaign management) I could have easily taken them on as clients. Speaking about the marketing ‘guru’ market in general, it is extremely easy to fall into the trap of selling a dream rather than selling a tangible strategy. I’m sure everyone at one point has seen a Facebook or YouTube from Tai Lopez or someone similar, promising to teach them the secret to working for yourself and becoming financially independent. It is a very fine line to walk when it comes to creating an online course in the marketing industry, and I never want to cross over to the ‘dark side’ of it that I’ve seen. ‍",1,0
75," The biggest challenge is figuring out a way to educate founders and marketers that there’s a whole new way that they can learn hard stuff. And that’s the peer to peer way. For example yesterday I couldn’t for the life of me figure out how to properly set up cross domain tracking on Google Tag Manager. So I jumped on a 15 minute Skype call with Max Corbeau, a growth mentor who specializes in analytics. He walked me through it on a Skype screenshare and within 3 minutes my problem was solved. If it wasn’t for him, I’d probably hire some freelancer to fix it for me and lose out on that opportunity to learn something new. Busy/successful people don’t have time to read hours of blog posts and watch online courses. Either they know how to do it, or they hire someone who can do it for them. Their time is too valuable to waste. Communicating succinctly that there’s a middle ground option is my biggest challenge so far in the realm of product marketing, but we’re getting there! In terms of the chicken vs. egg dilemma, I’d say the biggest challenge is demand side acquisition. The first month was easy, just post on Facebook Groups and communities and shout some stuff on LinkedIn. But after the low lying fruits are eaten, you need to become more sophisticated and choose your weapon of choice. Outbound? Inbound? PPC? Referral? I used to think, “I’ll just do them all!” but OMG, that does not work when you’re a team of two people working this alongside another full time job! Ideating, executing, and tracking results of growth experiments is relatively straight-forward, but for me, what’s most challenging is managing the pressure of taking corrective action based on the data. There’s a million directions you can take, and as growth lead, you have to make the tough calls. My biggest obstacle is controlling my FOMO. There’s always going to be that annoying little voice in the back of your head telling you that you’re missing out on huge opportunities by not doing that “new cool thing.” 99% of the time that voice is just talking shit. Ignore it.  ‍  My greatest disadvantage is that I don’t know Ruby on Rails, I’m a non-technical founder. I can’t just jump into the code and fix things. Anything that needs to be done like bug fixes or new features has a significant cash cost. And as a bootstrapped founder, this can get a bit demoralizing. To know that you have the design and spec sheet ready for <insert here killer feature>  but you just can’t afford it. I guess that’s life though :)  But on the flip side, being a non-technical founder also can have it’s advantages. You end up being much more deliberate with product development and rely on a lot of user testing and data to justify all your decisions. At the end of the day, you’re paying for it out of pocket, and building silly features that don’t move the needle stings. It also puts the fire on your ass to make more money. Nobody is going to come and save you, you have to save yourself. You want to build that new feature? Figure out a way to sell 100 new subscriptions!  In hindsight, my worst mistake was probably flying the team out to San Francisco for the StartupGrind conference. It’s not cheap to fly 4 people to San Francisco for a week, but the worst part was that I had to miss one of my best friend’s wedding to attend it. Sure, we got some great photos and made some solid connections, but overall was it worth it? I guess time will tell. On the flip side, I got the chance to see first hand how unattractive  the whole groveling for VC money scene is. I don’t know if I’d be so strongly footed in the #bootstrapped camp as I am now if I hadn’t seen that with my own two eyes.  ‍",1,0
76," As the app started to pick up steam, we started getting emails saying door guys weren’t accepting their covers. So we went to the door guys to ask why, and they were very candid in saying it’s a pain in the ass to pull out their phone, find their own app, and scan drunk people’s phones. So it was back to the drawing board. Ultimately, we determined that a user wouldn’t redeem a cover on purpose without getting an entry in return. So we created a button you would hold for 3 seconds, a yellow bar would fill behind the button over the course of those 3 seconds, and then the cover would vanish. Users would simply redeem the cover in front of a door guy for entry. Problem solved! ",0,0
77," The biggest challenge was selling to and convincing private gym owners that they needed yet another way to process payments and manage memberships. We made the huge mistake of not validating early on the base idea behind Gymlisted. We did not position ourselves as the provider of a service that could solve our target customer’s problem while also being something that those potential customers would want. An obstacle we were constantly faced with was very rarely getting a gym owner to get us to come in and showcase the website. It was after the idea of starting a tangential service to for private gym owners and offering it for free that they started really responding to us, even inviting us in to their gym to offer or free service.",0,0
78," As a growth lead, the biggest challenge I faced was to find a profitable marketing channel for the company’s product. You know, it’s not easy just applying all the traditional methods like taught on the courses, because each product has a distinctive characteristics. Mine is both in a small niche that has little to no case studies, and is targeting very specific segments of users.  Finding the right channel is the result of intensive experimenting and analyzing results, so as you can guess, it’s a matter of balancing your spent bucks with the ROI. Sometimes the ROI was unclear, but I had to reach my pocket anyway because the insight from my customer survey said so. Sometimes the ROI was a little bit clearer, but long-term, so I had to battle the impatience in seeing my dollars going away without almost nothing in return.  I think my solution at that time was to stop doing everything, and rethink about my long-term goal for the product. That helped me prioritize which experiments would be run first, and what I should expect out of it. While I’m betting on some short-term tactics which burn a lot of cash, I’m still backing up the plan with investment in long-term solutions in case things don’t go my way.  My mom is a typical Asian mom, who values dinner together and more “traditional” jobs at state-owned companies. Seeing me going heads over heels about this startup made her worried and she couldn’t stop complaining to me and asking me why I’m so late for dinner every time. The family pressure was rising every day when I started working on Saturday once in a while (which is abnormal here in Vietnam) and when I become more stressful with unsuccessful campaigns.  I decided to have a heart-to-heart talk with her and started explaining every bit of my job in mom’s language so she could somehow understand what I am doing and how important the role is to the company. Things got quiet down, but I know, deep down inside, she’s still worried. But now at least she doesn’t exert pressure on me every late dinner.    I think the greatest disadvantage of Habitify team is market understanding. We’re targeting Japan and the US, the two largest economies in the world with completely different cultures and social norms. When we were launching campaigns, there was a part deep inside that keeps wheezing because we are not completely confident about offering the “right” thing for our customers. I also see that this disadvantage kept us from innovating the product and being robust in our marketing. Our worst mistakes were to invest in short-term growth hack tactics, to which I think the lack of market understanding attributes largely. Instead of building sustainable foundations, we spent too much time expecting quick results and crying over spilled milk. Admittedly it was me who was obsessed with some quick numbers that I did everything at the disposal of the company’s brand. This did cost me a huge load of money, but more than that, it was the loss of time and the damaged brand that have a more profound effect.  ‍",1,0
79," The biggest mistake was spending too much time on the early phases of the startup and not enough on determining the feasibility of the product. The biggest challenge was determining whether or not the product was technically possible given the constraints we had.  If we had spent more time working on the feasibility of the idea earlier on, we would have had a better understanding of the R&D requirements around this problem. If we were deeply passionate about solving this problem, it might have been a different story, but as I mentioned, neither of us were farmers and it wasn’t an industry were particularly driven to build a business in.  ‍",0,0
80," I faced a few challenges in the process of building Hashtag Pirate, mainly getting my point across to the developers. You need to have patience because sometimes developers do it wrong. Another big challenge was to compete against big websites that offered a lot of Instagram search services, even though what I offered was unique and more useful. You might be offering the best service, but that doesn't increase your ranking or give you priority in traffic. Finally, I think my biggest mistake was building my services around Instagram API which I had no control of. I was naive. You should do more research and predict changes for at least the very near future when building a web application. Or at least when you hear about changes to an API, you should change your business right away to avoid failure. ‍",0,0
81," One of my biggest early challenges with Hawkers was convincing the co-founders to outsource the manufacturing of sunglasses. They wanted to keep it in-house, but I had business connections that offered an affordable way to get the work done without losing control over the process. If I were starting again today, I would have insisted on more transparent customer service policies right away. Today we update customers immediately if there is a problem with their order at any stage of the supply chain, but that was not always the case. Making this change has led to greater brand loyalty and customer goodwill. ",1,0
82," The biggest mistakes I made with Hawthorne Strategies were not securing capital and leaving my job prematurely even though it required me at a full-time capacity. Additionally, I had created a consulting service with no boundaries and didn’t know how to enforce contractual obligations. I jumped into the Hawthorne Strategies, LLC with peanuts of resources and was totally dependent on my first client for survival, which is a recipe for disaster. That created a stressful situation and created leverage for the client to take advantage of talent and offerings.  The verdict remained: my lack of understanding of how to run a business was at the core of all of my problems. I was trying to figure it all out as I went, like many entrepreneurs but unfortunately, I ran out of time before that lack of knowledge caught up with me.  ‍",0,0
83," One of the biggest challenges was the large amount of “entrepreneurs” plagiarizing Headlime, stealing the code and content, and launching it under another name. This made me very cynical back in the days, but I’ve come to realize building a successful product will get copied. You just have to work harder to be more innovative enough than the copycats. Something I managed to do by launching version 2 of the tool. Another obstacle was the large amount of negativity you get when you’re put in the spotlight. Negative comments from customers or competitors trying to sabotage me got me down for a while. Luckily I have a well-supporting group of fellow entrepreneurs around me who would cheer me up and cure my imposter syndrome. Headlime felt like my one golden ticket to wealth, and I was scared daily it would all get taken away. I’d wake up with multiple churn messages in the morning, and it would absolutely ruin my day. Or a competitor got funding, and I’d be scared days were over for me. The most significant upside of selling Headlime might have been calming my mind. Running a high-growth business is tiring. I’m lucky I was still young, without kids. I have the utmost respect for any founder who juggles many responsibilities on the side. ",1,0
84," One of the biggest obstacles we overcame was making it to just before the 1-year mark. We had dwindling sales, and all of our contracts were running out. In August of 2016, we only had only two weeks of runway left.  One of the 4 founding partners ultimately decided agency life wasn’t for him, and he left the company simultaneously.  With our backs against the wall and only one full-time employee other than the remaining three partners, we had a “come to Jesus” moment. We gathered in Eric’s basement bar, poured a drink, and said either we’re going to do this, or we’re not.  If anyone else was out, this was their opportunity to hit eject.  We all were in. We had a vision for what Headway could become and an appetite to bet on ourselves to make it happen.  ",1,0
85," Shared inbox is critical software for any business as your business runs on it. So, the biggest challenge for us was to provide 24 hr support to our customers. Also, given our team’s location (India), the time zone difference made things even more challenging.  So, to overcome this, we firstly worked in shifts ourselves. And, then use Upwork to hire a support agent in PST timezone.     Timezone difference b/w our key market and our team’s location is definitely a big disadvantage.  But, the bigger challenge is that the shared inbox market is still pretty small in comparison to some of the other SaaS domains like CRM, cloud telephony, digital signature, etc.  I’m not saying that the market is tiny but it’s not big enough to create enough organic growth to sustain & grow. So, it will require a lot of effort and capital to create a mini-brand and reach the first million. Please note that I’m talking about market size in relative terms (i.e. in relation to markets our other products are in).  I feel that the worst mistakes that we have made as a team are:  Delaying our launch in order to build more & more features before launch. Targeting broad & multiple use cases. In the last few months, we have got some clarity on best-suited use cases for our product but we have definitely lost some time and money.  ",1,0
86," Our MVP wasn’t focused enough on a pressing user problem. From weeks of user interviews, it seemed that nearly everyone we talked to had a gripe about their hair experience, but the complaints were related to different issues: expense, booking, opaque pricing, quality, etc. We grouped all of these user needs together under the umbrella of “finding a good hair stylist,” but we should have been more focused on delivering a product that addressed one need very well instead of many needs halfway. Also, we are first-time entrepreneurs, which makes it riskier (and scarier) to work on a project that won’t make money for a long time. I think that Hot Barber is doable if the founders raised venture capital at the onset or built and grew the website on the side while working a full-time job, but it wasn’t a good fit for us. ‍",0,1
87," To sum up our mistakes, I highlighted our mistakes to make it easier. Our market was too small.We just couldn't figure out how to effectively monetize. We implemented a few monetization features, however, customers just weren't willing to pay for it.We created unnecessary costs for ourselves and spent our limited funds covering those costs.Inability to be able to focus on one mini-project and seeing it through before moving on. We were always quick to change course at the slightest challenge.At a point, we started chasing the wind. What doesn’t concern us, we saw ourselves chasing.We had serious management issues. Implementation of decisions was very slow and this was because founders argued and argued on what direction to take over time. We barely ever agreed on anything.We ran out of funds and then slowly, we saw life began to drain from us.Over time, we all got discouraged and worn out.We realized late that Hubrif would have been a brilliant project as a Social Not-for-profit initiative. Perhaps we would still have been alive if we treated it as such.At the height of it all, I had to take a stand. Either to keep petting an almost dead horse or move on to help nurture a newborn horse.

88," Challenges you have faced in the process of building and growing Hubstaff. One of the biggest challenges we faced while building and growing Hubstaff was the technology, it’s very complex. We have one of the strongest platforms for time tracking in existence which is a great feeling and we’ve built it with a relatively small team but it was a very challenging software to build. ‍ The obstacles you have had with Hubstaff. The biggest obstacle I’ve faced as an entrepreneur is figuring out where to place my resources, it’s kind of like a game of chess. I really enjoy the challenges of entrepreneurship but I’ve realized over time that it takes a lot of guts to go through with when you have a family and employees that are counting on you.   Obstacles and challenges in your personal life, while building your business. The biggest challenge in my personal life has been creating a work/life balance. It’s easy to get caught up in work, especially when your office is at home. I’ve learned that sometimes I have to disconnect and unplug. My goal has been to create a team that is equipped to answer questions and solve problems for themselves so that I can achieve a work/life balance that in the end will make me a better entrepreneur because of it.    Mistakes you, or your team, have committed. The biggest mistake we made was offering a free plan. In the beginning, we thought this would bring in quick and constant revenue but in the end, we realized there was no benefit to this method. Free plans take up resources and don’t necessarily attract future customers but rather people who are merely interested in a free product. If we were to do it all over again, we never would have offered the free plan.   Did you make any mistakes that cost you time and/or money? What were they? Spending time and money on developing the wrong features is a huge mistake. I’ve since learned to make sure that we are spending time on features that our customers are going to use every day.   Things that could have been made in a better way. Customer feedback is the most important thing and simple surveys can provide you with so much information. Looking back, we would have done a survey or relied on direct feedback before moving forward on a new feature. ‍",1,0
89," As I’m reading through this interview, it seems everything was great and I was moving from one job to another. In reality, there was no support network around to bounce off ideas or to bring others onboard. The majority of my working life has been remote working in Asia, usually from home by myself, bootstrapping and having the difficulty of facing a work/life balance whilst spending time working out what I should be doing. Being based in China and running an internet business was hard. The majority of popular sites from Google, Facebook, Twitter were blocked in the country so I had to find alternatives to use. My daily routine isn’t healthy either, with hours ranging from 9 am to 1am on most weekdays. In terms of the niche of crowdfunding, Kickstarter has a bad reputation. Even if the campaign owner reaches their goal and successfully funds, it doesn’t mean backers will receive their product on time (or if at all!). Right now 160 new campaigns per day are added to the Kickstarter platform, but if the problem persists combined with a low 30% success rate I can see entrepreneurs finding non-crowdfunding ways to raise finance in the near future.    The biggest mistake is not launching Version 2 of Hyperstarter. We could have launched 1 year ago, but instead, refinements and changes have delayed the launch. Right now, it’s not so urgent as the site is automated and it’s bringing in regular sales per week. Version 2 has the possibility of bringing in dozens of automated sales per day, so between working on campaigns per day or working on V2, we need to work on our own site ASAP. We could have captured emails better at the beginning. Previously, users could run their Kickstarter URL and then after they didn’t know what to do next. We implemented a free downloadable PDF report, in exchange for an email address which works very well in collecting emails for our newsletters. ‍",1,0
90," Being an entrepreneur is not easy. You have to make a lot of sacrifices and fight your way through some of the toughest obstacles in order to see your business flourish. We didn't know much about entrepreneurship when we started, but we learned things through tons of trial and error and consistent hard work. Not knowing anything about how to build a business was the biggest challenge for us. But, as I look back now, I must say that it was actually a blessing in disguise. Pete and I literally put our sweat, blood, and tears into growing the company, and I mean “literally”. The emotional, physical, and mental struggles that we faced were imperative to our success, but we persevered and never gave up.  A good example was Pete losing his firstborn child, who was a beautiful premie baby that couldn’t hold on any longer after about seven weeks or so. During that time it was incredibly challenging because Pete had to step away from his traditional work hours, and I had to step in and take on a lot of that workload.  The lack of sleep and stress during the years caused us to get sick continuously while also working because we had no choice but to continue to work, taking a very little vacation, and times of heavy anxiety were frequent during the mountains of challenges that were in front of us.  However, as business partners and brothers-in-law, we balanced out each other, picked one another up when the other was down on the ground, worked together, stayed positive, trusted, and made big things happen.  Some of the biggest mistakes/poor decisions we made are the following: Not taking our time, patience, and process to hire correctly. We hired way too quickly sometimes.Taking too long to let employees go that were harming our business or weren’t a good fit.We hired new employees based on the assumption that new sales and revenue was going to be generated in the near future. Do not play “the role of God” and assume new deals will close, and allowing yourself to go on a hiring spree. Only hire based on your current financial situation, comfort level, and monthly cash flow. Project cash flow is good to be mindful of, but it shouldn’t be used to determine when to hire new people.We kept working with clients that were harmful to our business because of financial desperation sometimes but hurt us in the long-run. Sometimes you have to let your clients go and part ways, it will benefit both parties.When times were great financially, from time to time we neglected the smaller potential clients. Sometimes these smaller clients are your bread and butter, this is something to really be aware of. In the later years, we scaled too quickly regarding the size of our team and newly incurred expenses, and sales were difficult to catch up. We let our emotions take over, stress us out, and not make the best business decisions. It’s important to not be emotionless, but in a sense not let your emotions and personal feelings dictate your business decisions.At times we tried to focus on too many different things, trying to do too much, which tends to clutter up the organization of other effective strategies, processes, and tasks at hand. Stay focused and don’t try to take on more than you can handle, as it can negatively impact your growth and create confusion within the company, and ultimately cause delays in achieving your goals.  ",1,0
91," With IMPOSSIBLE, we’ve had no limit to people copying our brand, steal domain names, and even straight-up copying our logo. It’s been a massive headache, but something that I’ve come out the other side with a huge trial-by-fire knowledge base and I try to use it to help other entrepreneurs avoid the same headaches I’ve had to deal with. Business-wise, one of my biggest mistakes was overinvesting in the content on our Ultimate Paleo Guide site and not investing enough in marketing the content we did have. you can call this going “wide” instead of “deep” - which I wish we would have done sooner. For example - our beginner’s paleo guide and recipe section are hugely popular - we built out tons and tons of recipes, but we could probably have done half the content and twice the promotion. Also - when we moved from manual meal plans to our meal planning app - we took on a MASSIVE technical challenge + upgrade. We should have done this in smaller steps rather than biting off a big chunk in one go. When you find something - jump on it - we’ve found great success with our stretching pages and mewing guides on MoveWell so we’re doubling down on those.  One of the good things about having multiple sites is we can quickly learn from our mistakes + correctly quickly. For example, when we saw how well MoveWell was doing, we built out ImpossibleFitness.com in a similar way so we could scale up much faster and reach more people. ",1,0

Through this experience, I’ve learned that developing great software takes a lot of time and resources (money and experience). We are very excited for the day our tech is complete for college athletes and brands to finally receive the whole Inked Sports experience. ‍",1,0
94," Around 2013 I realized that SEO just wasn't working for me anymore. I was competing against companies that were worth millions, if not hundreds of millions, and they had entire departments focused on SEO. And they were winning. I was slowly losing my rankings and by spending all my time on SEO (which wasn't working anyway) IWantThatFlight.com.au was falling behind competitors in usability and features. I needed to let go of SEO and find a way to promote IWantThatFlight.com.au. It took a long time (Like everyone, I went through the entire ""Traction"" book) but eventually, I found a way to make Facebook work. I also worked with forums to find out exactly what visitors wanted and reacted to. This wasn't so much asking what they wanted, but just constantly posting updates/information and seeing which had the biggest response. Having 2 small children (3 and 5) during the most stressful time in 2013 probably did help, but they gave me a great release when I wasn’t working. ‍  Where to begin? Luckily, nothing that has proved too painful. The number one this was hiring without a practical test as part of the interview process and then having to let the employee go soon after hiring. ‍",1,0
95," A big obstacle we found was selling to industries. These were so used to placement agencies coming to them and charging 8.3% for employees sent. We tried to explain them our process which was a unique model that involved the offline and online world. However, they kept confusing us with placement consultancies. They paid us the small job posting fees and then expected us to give services of placement consultancies. For this reason, is that we had to spend a lot of time educating clients and explaining them our process. Jobridge was a concept ahead of its time, which is always a challenge. For us, explaining and educating our customers took a lot of time. Sales only happened after a lengthy process of educating customers. We also had some disadvantages. We were in the business space and no one from the team had any experience with it. ‍",0,0
96," The largest obstacle was having every single unit become defective due to a bad batch of batteries. It was my largest purchase of cards and my vendors were placing sizable POs in the $20,000 range. I learned it was all defective about 4-5 months after selling thousands and thousands of units. It was painful and embarrassing. I hated getting up in the morning and reading my emails about complaints and my customers feeling cheated. Wisely, I had kept the money in the company, and slowly I had to refund every order and resend working units later on. When it was all done I didn’t any money left, or trust with my vendors, or much else. I didn’t even know if buying new cards would save me or bury me deeper. Obviously, I chose to keep going. My manufacturer did take the heat and offered to replace the units. But the damage was very severe. Shipping was costly, vendor orders shrunk significantly, and Amazon reviews were at one star. This Amazon effect crushed my direct sales as it was #2 on any search of Joker Greeting a glaring 1 star. The party was definitely over. This was late 2016. Above all, I tried very hard to be patient with every single customer. I begged for a second chance and sent them free cards when I got new ones. I cut prices with some vendors to try and keep the relationship and keep them happy. And I had to fix my Amazon rating I stopped selling that card and made sure no one else was selling that SKU on Amazon. I designed a new card and color and relaunched a new SKU on Amazon. On top of this, I had to get more reviews on Facebook and Google but I had to wait for all my defects and angry customers to stop complaining. Once I was able to fix my cards I was able to turn on a customer rating feedback and with 237 reviews were have 4.5 stars. Super happy about this! Other obstacles in comparison to this are small. Personal life and family (I have a wife and two kids now) is always a challenge but I don’t think it’s any more difficult than a normal job. It’s just different challenges.    The biggest mistake was pushing other non-traditional ideas too quickly. I knew that Birthday and Christmas cards were selling really well. I should have really focused on those two a lot more rather than pushing my Baby Card, and I’m Sorry, and other cards that sell less often. I ended up with too many units sitting on the shelf and not enough of the units I sell through. ‍",1,0

98," Every roadblock to growth has forced me to look more closely at what we really need in the tool and what we must continue to improve over time. In the early days, we launched a version of the product that was self-serve and many customers didn’t understand our approach, so they ended up misusing the tool. We’ve since gone back and provided guidance and education to help people get their campaign underway in a far more efficient manner. We are a super lean team and we are growing while also still striving to educate customers who are accustomed to more traditional PR outreach or not experienced in outreach at all. We work hard to support our customers’ campaigns and provide them with the tools necessary for several different outreach tactics.   Financially, being bootstrapped has given me the freedom to take things at my own pace. For many other founders, this path isn’t the best way to go. Despite the limitations, I have no regrets about the decisions I’ve made to grow JustReachOut. ‍",1,0
99," The number one challenge we have faced is trying to separate the signal from the noise. You get a TON of noise and it is very, very distracting. You get paying customers who ask for new things they don’t need and don’t use. You get investors telling you that you need to do X instead of Y and they don’t really know the business or sector but are applying general things they have read or experienced. You get competitors releasing new features that scare the crap out of you but then you go have a closer look and you realize that they are completely over-hyping their capabilities. Anything you can imagine, it happens. Money is the second biggest challenge. There is such a thing as being overfunded, but we have no idea what it actually feels like because we have always been lean and efficient. But, for sure if we had $1 million in the bank we would be doing more and better things right now, so we have to overcome the growth obstacle because there are only three main ways to get meaningful cash: Demonstrate a tech benchmark that is much, much higher than the best in the sector and raise money from VCs who value tech.Sell your product/service to paying customers for a profit.Get tons and tons of loyal free users and demonstrate the data advantage that gives you compared to everyone else. Any of these can also mean you get acquired by someone who sees either your tech or your product or your revenue or your customers as valuable. But that’s an endgame not an obstacle. Nobody has failed by realizing, “damn nobody wants to acquire us.” They failed before that happened. There is also the personal challenge that I’ve been through. For the past five years I’ve been pretty much unable to invest in improving the quality of my life. I went from having a pretty nice monthly income to less than 10% of that income, and that affects where/when you can go on holiday, what kinds of nice things you can buy, whether you can help people in need, and even what healthcare plan you can afford for yourself and your partner. It’s pretty brutal but it’s necessary so you don’t have this false sense of security. The first $225k into the company came from my own pocket, and I know there are gurus who say don’t do that, but I think it’s helped sharpen my focus further to not have the distractions that go with more personal financial resources. Sounds totally counterintuitive, but it also means you have to sell your vision to investors, you have to find other ways of incentivizing your people, and you have to find perseverance you didn’t know you had. Cliché but nonetheless true.  Our greatest disadvantage is our ambition. We know we are taking on the world’s giants like Adobe, Apple, Vimeo (part of the massive IAC group) and many other well-funded companies and startups. We envisage an ideal world where people from anywhere and any financial capability can express their creativity. Why is that a disadvantage? Because we are constantly biting off more than we can chew and trying to do more and more, introduce newer and more amazing technology, and getting further and further ahead of the tech curve. That tends to put more of a focus on building and less of a focus on growth, and because we rely on web browser technology to deliver our service, we are always pushing the boundaries of what those browsers were designed and built to do with video. It’s one thing if you just want to play back video in a browser it’s another thing entirely to get a millisecond-specific cut in a video based on the exact timing of a sound. So to counteract that, you have to continuously try to bring innovation to your customers but resist the temptation to build “just one more feature.” We’ve built a massive service with so many moving parts and we did that while trying to just make it easier and faster for people to convert their videos from one size to another. Never underestimate complexity, but also don’t let your ambition drive you to increase that complexity beyond its minimum required level. ",1,0
100," So many mistakes! I remember understanding for the first time what it means to become a sort of public figure. In a semi-private space of Kaya.gs (a private channel, but accessible for many people) I made a jokingly sarcastic comment about a user making an unreasonable request. It was the writing style of that space, which was not taboo or insulting. A user took a screenshot and made a huge fuss in another forum where that would be taboo: a classic case of Schadenfreude. The first time I had to learn about PR meant, about watching what you say and how you say it because it can be taken out of context.  This is related to another challenge we had: we wanted to be the Server where we would do everything for the user. Go Servers had a famous reputation of being trigger happy with banning and treating users with some contempt. Some servers would ban you for just mentioning other servers! We, on the other hand, created a place for users to vote on features and participate in product prioritization. This gave us invaluable feedback, but it was also unruly. Consumers are all-demanding and it’s particularly insidious with free/freemium products: when you give the user some power and they cannot exert it, they become detractors. A lesson that is very evident in services like Twitter or Reddit, where it's filled with people that post constantly every day, pay nothing and still deride the services they use. There were plenty of Engineering mistakes, but I think they stemmed from inexperience and from product direction. I wanted to build everything, so we had everything half-built. I would tell myself to focus on key features first, end-to-end, before moving on to the next one. Another thing I learned later in my career was being more data-driven. I should have picked the key metric (# of games) and made sure that was the metric that improved every single day. That would have done wonders for the three issues: would have focused Product, would have made Engineering easier by having fewer features and work better and would have raised Morale had we been successful at improving it.‍ ‍",0,0
101," In addition to the pivot, the early stages of the pandemic are no doubt at the top of the list. Trying to connect with team members across regions and time zones when we were used to collaborating in-person and real-time was a big challenge. Especially given how much our team members rely on and support one another. Finding team members who are the right fit, remotely, is an ongoing challenge. It’s one we’ve overcome with some roles, but still face with others. We want to continue building a supportive, creative culture for our team, especially as we’re working remotely. But recruiting remotely can make assessing that quite a challenge. In terms of mistakes, there’s nothing much that I would call the worst because our missteps have often led to finding new ways to do things. Like building out our CRM and productivity tools to measure and assess how we’re doing. If I had to choose I’d say it’s pushing ourselves too hard. Burnout is tough to bounce back from. And while you want to give your customers a great experience, and support your team members to the fullest of your abilities, you have to step back from time to time to rest and recharge. ‍",1,0
102," I think we were trying to bite off more than we can chew without fully appreciating the type of effort and know-how that was required for running a startup. We simply did not have the skillsets at the time to bring the idea to a product, and we also did not have the funds or resources to obtain that type of help the SWOT analysis saved us from learning this the hard way. With Ridj-it, we found that having access to money and being good at managing money, having work experience, and ability to pick up skills as needed were important predictors of success. Our mistake, apart from trying to competing with established competitors, was not being prepared enough to manage a start-up. ‍",0,0
103," First and foremost avoiding talking to customers. When I say ‘avoiding’, I mean that I intuitively knew it was the right thing to do, but I still didn’t get the courage to do it in fears I would get rejected. I also felt I knew better, thinking that I understood the problems people were facing, so there was just ‘no need’ for additional customer discovery talks.  Why waste that precious time? I also felt uncomfortable talking about it with strangers, so these are all fears founders must overcome in order to get good at getting to know their customers.  The other huge mistake I made was to take out a loan to start the business.  The failure rate among startups is so high that it’s simply not worth risking your own money. Instead aim for accelerators, incubators, and angel/VC money.  Better yet, before even talking to them, I would focus on validating the demand first before ever jumping into those conversations which can usually take months.",0,0
104," I definitely made a lot of mistakes when building Kopely but I think the failure of Kopely was out of our control.  Outside of COVID-19,  one of my biggest mistakes was trying to compete against monster companies like Headspace and Calm. Some people thought I was crazy that I was trying to compete with companies who had a marketing budget that was 1,000,000x more than ours. But, I still felt that Kopely was a unique offering and I was so passionate about delivering better tools around stress management (that weren’t meditation) that I didn’t care. I also found it really difficult to explain to people that we weren’t a meditation app. When I told people that Kopely was a stress relief app their brains went immediately to meditation apps.  And, it was really hard to drive interest with such a small (nearly non-existent) marketing budget. I love grassroots marketing but I found it really hard to compete online. I wish I had more of a marketing budget to attract early adopters more quickly.  ‍",0,0
105," Our greatest challenge has been the lack of a structure to meet the exponential growth of the project. As our revenues started to grow significantly, we realized that very small decisions could have very big impacts on the entire business, both in positive and negative terms. We had to structure LeadsBridge as a real company and be mindful about our weaknesses. Something that helped us immensely was looking at the metrics and taking our most important decisions based on that. For example, we started crossing the website data (Google Analytics) with our MRR, cash flow and churn. Then we started to pay closer attention to the multiple touch points data instead than just to the last one, in order to understand better our sources of conversion. On another level, we started optimizing every single step of the workflow of our micro-teams, from developers to marketers, since managing a remote team is extremely challenging. Last but not least, keeping on crafting the best plans for our customers had a huge impact on our revenues. When we started split-testing multiple solutions and implement new ideas faster, we gained more feedback and we started to control our business better, which benefited both our revenues and customer satisfaction. ‍  Well, we made a lot of them! One time we started an ad campaign with our landing page down, and we lost a lot of money. Another time we messed up with the check-out page, and so we lost again lots of clients and money. Then we launched products that were very hard for our clients to adopt, so we had to design everything again from scratch losing hundreds of hours of work. But hey, I am so grateful for all the mistakes because we learned so much from them and they fueled our growth. ‍",1,0
106," Beyond the COVID launch debacle, the most amusing challenge we ran into was found in the manufacturing of our new flavors. We went through two months in early 2021 when each batch of our Raspberry Hibiscus flavor turned to a glob of jello overnight in the carbonation tank. I remember having to write a lengthy email to a group of our angry retailers explaining that as much as we wanted to fulfill their orders for the new flavors, they’d be even madder at us if we shipped them this gelatinous mess of a product. Despite how frustrating that situation was, my team never gave up and kept tweaking until we found a solution. Interestingly enough, it was the manufacturing processes that we ended up inventing over that crazy period that allowed us to patent our process. What’s more, Raspberry Hibiscus has been our top seller ever since it came out. It’s funny how great challenges like this if overcome, can often yield the greatest rewards.  Looking back at it, we went through a lot of unnecessary suffering on the production and operations side because I refused to spend money on veteran personnel in the early going. I know this cuts counter to the bootstrapping mentality I’ve been talking about, but ingredient sourcing and manufacturing—F&B-related operations—is something I strongly recommend finding prior experience for if you do not have it yourself. As I was starting Leilo up, I had total confidence that effort and common sense could make up for an industry-hardened COO, and I was wrong. For instance, the first 15k cans of our Lemon-Ginger flavor were over-sweetened 10x with stevia and pretty much unusable in retail, setting us back almost a full quarter.  The replicable integrity of your product is everything once you hit the market, so it pays to have this set ahead of time by an expert. Find someone who can procure an impeccable supply chain and maintain steady production, and don’t let them go—they’re hard to find but indispensable in our line of business. While it may seem expensive at the time, it is undoubtedly cheaper than screwing up successive production runs due to inexperience. Ultimately, you’ll be forced to hire a professional anyway, so I recommend doing this from the onset and saving yourself a massive headache and lots of money.  ",1,0
107," The biggest challenge is growing, and doing it so at the same rate as in previous months.  The more you scale, the more challenges you get on the tech, marketing, and support side, so you really need to build processes. Things can go really fast and double in just a few months, and if you do so, you need to be ready to handle the load. ‍  I’ve already mentioned the UX and referral program mistakes. I think I’ve also committed some mistakes when it comes to hiring. We hired a developer who pretended to be really good, for example, to whom we paid a lot of money. However, as the days went on, we started realizing there were days he wasn’t working on lemlist but doing other things. When we asked him, he felt it was normal not to have told us about it before. He generated tons of bugs because the code was of poor quality and it was really a waste of time. We even tried to convince ourselves that we could train him and help him get better, but that didn’t happen. Right now, we're much more strict. If someone doesn’t fit the requirements that we have, we just fire him and that's all. I always recommend hiring and firing fast. Another mistake we committed was going after enterprises early on. After doing some prospecting in Silicon Valley, I met with Uber. We had five or six meetings and they were always super interested. I started spending a lot of time and then they started asking us about regulations, safety, security, etc. I was like holy shit. I started talking about it with my co-founders and everyone was super excited. But after looking at this, we realized it would require three to four months of development, just for a deal that we weren’t sure we’d be able to close. So we thought: “Let's focus on our main market, which is essentially SMEs and startups, and move on”. ‍",1,0
108," User acquisition. You're fighting for the same bandwidth that kids have for free time. How do you make parents aware that you exist?  Second, the fact the kid wants to play those games, or that the parent forces the kid to play them is a huge barrier at those ages. Because it's much easier to watch videos on YouTube than interacting with an app. The kid’s timespan attention is limited. One of the biggest barriers was how to generate that engagement with kids. We aimed to provide value for parents with our reports. We were showing how much time the kid had played, what were the games he had played, what were the concepts we were trying to teach kids with those games, and how well or how bad they were doing with them. In the end, we never achieved such value for parents. ‍",0,0
109," The biggest battle is with the doubts we all face in the beginning. I didn't know anyone in my life doing what I do, so basically, I had no real proof it was possible. That’s okay for me, though, as I’m not the type of person who relies on others for support and I got plenty of motivation from people I follow online and all the great success stories out there.  What helped me get through these doubts and the fear of failure was the dissatisfaction I had with my previous lifestyle. I wasn’t doing anything meaningful, wasn’t independent, wasn’t making the most of my time every day, and was constantly reminding myself that there must be something more to life. This mental state doesn’t let you stop doing things in order to find a way out of the system and create a better lifestyle and one on your own terms.  So years before I did anything online that made money, I was reading about those who did it and who succeeded. They all started from nothing (I’m a big fan of self-made millionaires), had no connections, capital or experience in the beginning. But the digital world makes it possible for anyone to enter, build something and earn. There’s another stage - that of boredom. You enter it after you’ve been working on your passion project for a while and see no results. I had to remind myself of my vision to stay on track. That meant I was still waking up earlier than I had to and dedicated time to my work related to what will one day be an online business. Even when there wasn’t any official work yet, I built the discipline of someone doing it full-time. Now it’s still the first thing I do when I start the day, and that feels just as right. The next challenge is distractions. I was reading a lot about zen and minimalism before I turned Let’s Reach Success into not just a blog but also a registered company in the country I moved to. And I did simplify my life long before I started adding other elements to it. That’s part of lifestyle design too. Removing the unnecessary, but also defining distractions and making sure you minimize them. That could be other people in your life, other goals you’re after, other projects you’re working on, the high expectations you have, your bad spending habits, your procrastination or laziness. All these were something I worked on, one thing at a time, to remove them. One of the best habits I ever developed was tracking everything I do. That allowed me to notice what works and do more of it, while removing the rest. For instance, here’s how my income has changed over the last year. Now, I’m ruthless with my time. I plan my work, prioritize, structure my days according to my prime time. You too should find out when you’re most productive, dedicate these hours only to your business and leave anything else for the rest of the day. ‍  Now that I think of it, every single thing was such a lesson, that I don’t wanna take it back. But here are some things that weren’t good ideas (although I did it all in my free time and am okay with such experiments as that’s how I got to know the publishing world in the first place):   Having a membership site I spent a ton of time researching the best membership plugins and made a big plan on how to set up and promote a membership site (which is no easy thing). Got one (great product, by the way) for around $100, did the setting up part, created specific pages, restricted old content, re-branded the site as it was now a platform offering premium content, and started writing content for members. After some time I realized I don’t know how to get people on board and my new, super practical content ended up being read by almost no one. So I accepted this failure, removed the plugin, made all content free again, and got back to how things were before. The thing is, I wanted to have the ideal recurring revenue model which still allowed me to keep writing but only for those who care enough to pay. But it’s a lot of hard work, I don’t know how to promote it (there are different techniques to market such a product), and it’s quite the responsibility to charge people on a monthly basis. But hey, I now know the ins and outs of this monetization model and took some lessons to other aspects of my work. ‍ Staying with BlueHost for too long I’m sorry to be mentioning names, but I just have to. I’ve been with Bluehost since the first day I moved to a self-hosted site, and they are really good for beginners. Affordable and one of the most popular hosting companies that everyone’s talking about. I then moved to a pro package, after which I signed up for WordPress managed hosting on a dedicated server. At some point, I was paying close to $500 per year, and getting the worst customer support experience, and downtime without any explanation. I was just done with it and earlier this month switched to WPX Hosting. So far, it’s been great. But I knew from before that they have wonderful support and a quality product built with WordPress in mind. I’m now much happier and saw immediate results in performance.",1,1
110," My biggest challenge was that I didn’t know how to code or build applications. I was depending a lot on my co-founders, who weren’t really into the project so didn’t care about improving the site. I didn’t even know how the features of the platform work.  I still think that having a technical co-founder is a really great strategy. But I also think that a proper co-founder who works full-time on the project is also a key point. We were not full-time. Otherwise, things could have been different and if we worked with somebody originally from Germany, then it would have been much easier – we could have tried other traction channels too! As for disadvantages, there were some: I didn’t know how to programme and couldn’t speak German fluently.The team was not full-time and more focused on other things.The market of Lieferoo. There were no competitors, which nowadays I know it’s not a great signal. Every startup that tried to do something similar, failed. There were some international competitors, like for example in the U.S., where the market is much more open and people tend to trust more on online services. ‍",0,0
111," I think my biggest mistake in business has been trusting the wrong people in my earlier years. However, I learned from my experiences and am much more discerning now about who I let into our company’s inner circle. Every business professional will face some type of betrayal in their career because of human nature’s desire to get ahead, sometimes at all costs.  There is no question that trust is a major factor in any organization’s culture of success and we certainly work to make sure we build it across all departments, among all employees. As far as obstacles, there have been a few. Call them speedbumps, call them roadblocks, we have had our share.  But we’ve been able to successfully weather them and come through those challenging times stronger and more determined than ever. ‍",1,0
112," The main issue I’ve been facing is how competitive the SEO industry is. New tools are coming to the market every day. Not only that, but I’m obviously also competing against the best SEOs for organic traffic. Depending only on Google for traffic is already risky in itself. Recently I got hit and lost a big chunk of it. I ran some SEO analysis and I finally identified the reason, thanks actually to my own tool Linkody. I lost 2 very powerful links, one from Fox News, and another from a big national portal. This happened just before the hit. The causality cannot be proven, but I would bet on it (you cannot be sure of anything with Google, don’t trust people who say otherwise). And so I’m back on building new links to compensate for the loss (actually paying someone to do it). ‍",1,0
113," When we started actively promoting LiveAgent, we quickly realized the big players like Zendesk and Freshdesk dominated the market. We were struggling with positioning ourselves and setting the right USP to stand out. Also, we are a bootstrapped company and we had to compete with companies with more than 300M+ in funding, which didn’t make acquiring customer easy.  Another struggle was finding the right talent. We’ve always had a hard time to find good sales reps and developers.  Recently, we also encountered quite a few problems with our datacenter provider which caused downtimes and we had to restructure our infrastructure completely. Thousands of companies rely on LiveAgent when supporting their end users, including fintech and telco companies, where even seconds matter. We had to invest a lot and act quickly because the consequences could have been fatal. Last but not least, new competitors are popping up like a mushroom, offering free plans with no viable business model. With that comes a higher demand for better functionality, improved UI and customer experience. It’s a constant game which is changing and maybe that’s what intrigues me about my work the most, it wouldn’t be so much fun it was that easy, right?  We should’ve optimized our onboarding process earlier, instead, we focused on adding more features. When we introduced a new getting started guide (which didn’t take much time to implement), we immediately saw a spike in conversions. We definitely should’ve done this earlier. We hired an agency to help us with our marketing initiatives and failed. They didn’t know the product well enough, they’ve focused on redesigning our pricing plans and website instead of finding new leads which cost us money and work time of our internal team. We also hired an external team which didn’t work out as well. They knew even less about the product and did not close a single deal. From that moment, we decided to minimize our outsourcing efforts and focused on hiring internally instead. ‍",1,0
114," Getting quality feedback was the main challenge when first starting. How do I validate my ideas? The only way I could get that was by talking with people. It's hard because you need to establish a relationship and give value to them before selling anything, because otherwise, they're not going to spend time with you. I gave feedback through Twitter if they launched something and offered to be a beta tester. You'd be surprised if you take that approach. They're going to reciprocate when you need help. ‍",0,0
115," Honestly, my biggest mistake is not choosing one thing and sticking with it. If my sole goal were to grow the business, have as much impact, and make as much money as possible, it would have been much easier to just do one thing. Managing 3 limits the opportunities for each, if I’m committed to not bringing on a team. As soon as I focus on one thing I’m dropping the ball on something else. I don’t know that I regret going this route as the opportunities each has afforded, and the lifestyle benefits I alluded to above, have made it worthwhile.  But I spend a lot of time thinking about what it would look like if I were to go all-in on just one thing and if it would be worth it. The biggest mistake we ever made in the business was a technical one. We moved the entire site over to a service called Rainmaker in 2016. It was a disaster. The member experience suffered, the company didn't deliver on any of their promises, and a month after switching traffic dropped 30%. We spent thousands to design the new site and move it over, and thousands more to move it back to WordPress two years later. The lesson here is to make sure if you’re going to trust your whole business to a technical platform that you verify it’s delivering on what they say it will. ",1,0
116," For me personally, it was misunderstanding the scope of everything I worked on. How to plan out something as massive and complex as thousands of people interacting is a hard problem to solve. But it’s infinitely more difficult if you don’t acknowledge that up front. I just started at one end and tried to work myself through it. Besides my personal failing with scope. I think the team never understood quite what we were building. The game to start with was a competitive strategy game, where each league lasted about three months. But we spent zero time designing a pipeline for content and league cycles. We only focused on the core product, which is very similar to feature creep. Because we never saw the entire lifespan of the product use we didn’t really create a process where we could deliver such a product. We only really achieved an embyotic state of such a product. To be fair though, the technical and development burden for that state is something like 80% of the entire product. So it wasn’t a case of prioritising completely wrong, we just missed out on a very important part of what we should’ve been building. ‍",0,0
117," The biggest challenges in working on Lunch Money has always been time management and prioritization. When I first started working on Lunch Money, I was splitting my time with 2 other freelancing commitments while living in a country that I was yearning to discover. I wanted to do everything! I knew I needed to make money but I couldn’t stop my brain from thinking about Lunch Money, all while also wanting to explore all the corners of Fukuoka, go on day trips, and spend time with friends and family who took the time to visit us abroad.  So I guess the issue was that I had too many things that I wanted to do but Lunch Money would always take up a disproportionately large amount of my time and energy.  To get over this, I realized that I had to reconcile my own feelings of guilt. It felt weird to be in such a privileged position of living abroad in Japan, yet spending almost all my waking hours in front of a laptop. Then I realized, who cares? I was happy. I was feeling fulfilled every day and I felt incredibly lucky to have all this time to work on a side project. I was thriving and I realized I hadn’t felt this way in a long time and I just needed to embrace my new lifestyle. ‍  The biggest disadvantage of starting a personal finance and budgeting app is that building trust with that first cohort of users is very hard. Typically, a beta testing round would include friends and family, but this can be especially difficult when it comes to something as private as finances. I knew I wasn’t going to try to convince somebody to trust my app with their personal data. That would have to come from within themselves, stemming from a desire to use a product that I created. So the best thing I could focus on to grow my initial user base was to create a product that was irresistible to trial! No single mistake that I’ve made was detrimental, but I can think of a lot of potential mistakes I could have made which would totally have derailed the progress of Lunch Money. I’d have to attribute the avoidance of these to being a solo founder– since I’m stretched so thin, I don’t actually have time to dive so deep into one thing that I lose sight of where I should be going. I’m constantly re-prioritizing the most important things to do and if something is taking me more than, say, 1 week, I think really hard about whether or not it’s really worth that time. The biggest mistake I could have made was creating a mobile app pre-launch. Lunch Money’s MVP was a web app and I was continuously haunted by the thought that not having a mobile app would put me at a huge disadvantage. About 3 weeks before my Hacker News launch, I set out to learn an entirely new framework (Flutter) AND programming language (Dart). I followed tutorials, listened to podcasts, and always tried to fit time for mobile app development in between feature improvements and bug fixes. It was a few weeks of frustration with myself that I was so slow to get this mobile app out! Talk about high expectations... Thankfully, other tasks started piling on so much that I re-evaluated the need for a mobile app and decided that it wasn’t necessary for launch. As a compromise, I priced my product much lower than competitors and hoped for the best. As it turns out, the demand for a mobile app was not as high as I thought it would be. In fact, after launch, it became apparent that most users were more interested in seeing the product continue to grow and develop, rather than being available on another platform. ‍",1,1
118," A huge weak spot for us has always been growth and marketing. We had multiple successful launches that made us rest on our laurels a lot, while we could be much more successful if we invested more time and energy in finding and growing our customer base. Even with a product like Boxy Suite (well positioned on Google and appealing to a large audience) we didn’t really do much content marketing, SEO, and growth for a lot of time, and this was a big missed opportunity. Luckily we started doing that later on and we’re starting to see results. Another challenge we’re always facing is to find the perfect work/life balance, allowing us to pursue personal passions while still working side by side and being productive and efficient. We’ve surely improved a lot in this regard, and I feel like honesty and good communication between co-founders are key here. Personally, I think my most challenging months were right after I quit my job. Suddenly having so much time for myself, and a world of possibilities, paradoxically made me depressed and unmotivated. I had to rebuild my routines, understand my priorities, and basically find out what I really wanted. That’s why 2019 has been such a transformative year for me, while I feel like 2020 is the year where I’m reaping what I sowed in the last few years.   If I had to pick a single big mistake we repeatedly did, is rushing our launches. Sometimes we worked for weeks or even months on a product, only to then plan and launch it in a few days. This means not taking advantage of a lot of low-hanging fruits and not really playing all your cards. We surely put much more thought into it now, and we also launch more often. Taking the time to prepare to launch doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it every few months. ",1,0
119," The biggest challenge is to find the right niche at the right time and provide a product that would fulfill the customer’s needs. I managed to do so by launching KWFinder and then creating Mangools SEO tools package with the team. It also taught me how to delegate tasks and let the teammates do what they are best at. When it comes to my personal stuff, I already mentioned that I had a lot of experience with online businesses, development and marketing. My knowledge wasn’t so deep but it was good enough for the start :) However, when KWFinder became a serious thing I realized it’s impossible to manage it on my own.  I would say that the whole team is a fan of trying new things and doing experiments. Many of our decisions are not based on any analysis. Sometimes it’s pure intuitive decision making. It works in most of the cases but the bigger we are, the harder it gets.  We recently switched from a freemium subscription model to a time-limited free trial which brought a lot of changes. We’re still analyzing the pros and cons. I must say that it forced us to make some decisions backed up by serious analysis. We’ll see how it goes but I guess it’s a natural thing as the business grows. We are learners, nobody in the team had previous experience with running a business that got to $2.7 million yearly revenue in less than 4 years. When it comes to our brand Mangools, to be honest, I wasn’t thinking that far ahead when I was starting with KWFinder. There was nothing like Mangools on the plan. A couple of years after, it’s a bit of a pity because KWFinder is still the bigger buzzword compared to Mangools but we are working on it. ‍",1,0
120," The biggest obstacle to starting a SaaS in our industry is competition. There are already tens of tremendous VC-backed competitors in niches related to ours: Project management tools, collaboration and productivity software, as well as help desk tools. To do this, finding a niche and working on positioning helped. Positioning our product as “Made for agencies” and tweaking features to solve their exact needs was a way to differentiate ourselves from the competition. In addition, building our distribution channels (our Facebook community and content) before making the product was helpful to get the initial traction. Our biggest mistake was to focus on “starters”.  Initially, we had decided to go for productized services and wanted to help anyone start a productized service. However, this was a mistake because those customers didn’t have a business yet and didn’t need most of the features our software offered. They also churned fast as they didn’t generate income yet to pay for our software. ",1,0
121," I wish we had adopted the RACI matrix (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) much earlier as a company. Sometimes we would move too fast, and the proper internal organization and communication weren’t done or was messy.  At times, this slowed us down afterward to backtrack and fix things or stalled us to move to the next phase as the proper steps were brought in. Excitement, urgency, and determination to get things done are outstanding attributes, but a method like RACI improves internal communication and accountability. The content optimization market has grown in the last few years. We were so early in the market that we spent a lot of time educating on the process and opportunity the technology presented. Now content optimization has almost become standard practice, which is great because the conversations have shifted away from education. Still, it also means there are a lot of players in the space. Now the discussions are around specific feature sets and comparing vendors. Content optimization isn’t the only aspect of our platform. We have a comprehensive inventory system with proprietary metrics for identifying opportunities and gaps across a domain during the content strategy and planning process. That coupled with content optimization is incredibly powerful.  We should have focused on freemium and product-led growth sooner. Because the market wasn’t mature and it was an unknown need, sales often drove product decisions. We innovated against enterprise needs, which worked out well for us at the time but had we taken a product-led approach sooner, it would have simplified our offering and made it more approachable and accessible. We’re excited to have a freemium offering now, and the product-led adoption is now part of our core decision-making, which is great to see. ",1,0
122," The most difficult parts of running and growing Matboard and More is team management. As much as I desire total control and freedom in my life and business, it's never completely possible as you don't work in a vacuum. There are always going to different opinions, competing personalities and managing those is the most difficult. I won't go into more detail than that as it delves into the personal but suffice to say, conflict is only productive when it's focused on tasks and processes, so don't let things get personal. The other big challenge was that I knew nothing about either matboards or digital marketing. This didn't scare me as I've always been a fast learner but when you think that I started from literally zero knowledge and self-taught myself to the point where Matboard and More is number one in SEO and PPC in the industry, I do feel proud of that. All I can say to that effect is that it was extremely fun and never felt like work. I love learning and having a challenge. The hard part is defining the problem, once you understand that it's a matter of simply working through it. I think most entrepreneurs that fail aren't really sure what problem they are solving so they don't have a clear direction. For me it was simple at first, improve conversions and increase ROI. Everything was focused on that and through experimentation, iteration and a lot of intuition we found the right sauce.    There have been a few critical moments where we've screwed up as a business, but thankfully we bounced back stronger each time. Some of these mistakes were simple stupidity, others stemmed from a lack of planning. For example, our display ads were suspended for a few weeks because I didn't get the email notifying that me that we were not in compliance with AdWords policy. I was out of town and not checking the campaigns regularly. That was a significant loss and was plainly just not paying attention, but easy enough to fix. A more serious problem was during our second Christmas season where we got way more business than expected. We could hardly keep up, and our machines broke down so it was weeks of nearly 24/7 working trying to get things up and running. We spent the next year focusing on in-house systems and technologies instead of the website. It was a tough decision that slowed down growth but we had limited resources and all that work helped set us up for the future growth. As a general principle though, we probably made a lot of mistakes of inaction as much as mistakes of action as well. We probably should have put more resources into certain areas and pushed our growth earlier. This may still be the case in fact, but it's difficult to know and hindsight is 20/20. ‍",1,0

124," We talked about the overblown MVP. That’s one of the things that bugs me a lot still since it didn’t only cost me those 4-5 months it took to initially build it, but also months of work to get to a common ground again (and removing a lot of the features in the process). I also mentioned that our first paying customer brought us about $5 in commission. We were simply scared to charge enough: We were charging on a weekly basis, which made people anxious and didn’t provide a lot of security for usWe only took 10% as a commission when some of our competitors took up to 30%We didn’t give people any kind of suggestions on what they should charge. After taking care of that and switching the business model around, we started growing a lot quicker. I could count a lot more things, but it comes down to one thing – I was scared to take risks. When I had my $100 in MRR, I didn’t want to switch things up because I thought I’d lose it. When I was at $500 in MRR, I thought that the business works as-is. But the point is, you can’t assume that whatever got you to $500 in MRR will also get you to $5,000 in MRR. You need to take risks and it’s easy to do so the smaller your business still is. ",1,0
125," The biggest challenges I faced during this time were personal. When I started the project, I was in a relationship that was coming to an end. Plus, I was almost broke because I had previously started another company and it didn’t go well. So, when I found myself facing a break-up and moving back to my parents’ place and going back to the dreaded 9-to-5 office work, well, you can imagine it wasn’t the best time of my life :) However, I had a vision and worked towards it. For me, my company has been and will always be the way to gain freedom and independence. I didn’t want a boss, that’s why I preferred to bootstrap and not go through the typical investment rounds because you end up doing what the VCs tell you. I preferred to grow slowly, at a steady pace and grunt work and take money only from my customers.  The three main mistakes I committed were: Taking full-time jobs. If you need money to pay the bills while you grow your company, do some freelancing. It’s best to be the owner of your own time.Not looking for a sales co-founder from the beginning. BTW, if you know of anyone who’s interested, point him or her to me )Coding too much. Building more features won’t make your product better, killing unused features will. I could have saved months of building stuff that no one ever used. ‍",1,0
126," The hardest part of building a community is that it takes a long time. And trying to “growth hack” the process will result in a crappy community. I believe authentic interactions over time are crucial to building trust between people. And trust is what a great community is built on. We’ve made many mistakes over the years, including when we booked 12 speakers to each speak for an hour at a two-day event (our first one). So it was six hours of talks per day. It was way too much information and the attendees tuned out after the first four. The thing we’ve learned, though, is that events must evolve or they die. And evolution means you have to try new things, even though some of those will flop. We’ve had speakers on stage who didn’t deliver. We’ve had sessions we thought would be great that turned out bad. At the time, these feel like mistakes, and I guess in a sense, they are. But without taking those risks and failing, I don’t believe we could have evolved the event like we have. ‍",1,0
127, Building vehicles is an endeavor not to be taken lightly because of the regulators involved and the large strategic partnerships you have to make to be able to just launch. This point is further validated by the fact that our product team got funding from the leading motorcycle manufacturer in 2016 and has now gone on to do a consumer-oriented motorcycle.                                                                                                                                               ,0,0
128," The biggest challenge, as I’ve mentioned a few times, was building up brand recognition and faith in a new product. And as said previously, that meant persuading professional cricketers to use it.  We hoped to persuade them by paying them lots of money and incentivising the usage of the bat. The MMi3 bat was to form as the standout piece of our range, and where we planned to generate the most revenue. Also at the time, Nike, Adidas, and Reebok decided to enter the market and sponsor cricket players. Now, when these multinationals are sponsoring a players cricket bat, they are not looking to recoup that spend in sales of cricket bats - they’re looking to build brand recognition, associated themselves with a hero, and sell their trainers. It pushed prices up and meant we had to spend more than we would have done only a few years earlier, or later when they left the market. Another challenge was the production of the bats. As someone who now runs a Software business, I’m much happier now I don’t have to stock a physical product. Physical products, such as the bats, kit bags, and protective pads/gloves were almost all produced in India which meant lead times were in excess of 60 days. For an order of 1,000 bats we would have a 45 day production time, then a further 30 day wait as they were shipped across on a container to Felixstowe.  That lead time, historically, has worked okay for cricket brands. Brands who have made bats for years have a predictable business. They’ll sell those bats to in September, send it straight for production, before delivery in November (Christmas) and March (just before the cricket season).  For a new brand to the market, though, it was tough. We were so reliant on players using the bats and scoring runs, that retailers did not want to commit to large orders. And those retailers that did order, we’d need to wait 90 days for payment with us fronting the cash for manufacture - so yes, there were regular cash-flow issues! When players did use the range and score runs, as Matthew Hayden did in 2010, we couldn’t produce the bats quickly enough and get them into retailers fast enough, resulting in upset customers. ‍ Of course we tried to forecast as much as possible and look at key televised games which would cause spikes in demand, but with around 300 SKUs (individual products) it was hard to ensure we had stock in the right places. I’ll touch briefly on SKUS and explain why a seemingly relatively simple business ends up having over 300 unique product barcodes. Again, this is another nuance of physical products which we don’t suffer from in SaaS. At Mongoose, we produced, to begin with, 2 distinct models of cricket bats. Sounds easy? Though when you look at those 2 models, there were 4 grades pitched at different price points from beginner to professional level. Those grades then had to be offered in the 7 Junior sizes along with at least 3 variations in weight for the adult range. And that was just the bats. We offered protective pads, gloves, thigh guards and bags which all needed to be stocked in different sizes and dexterities.  Take it from me - stick to software! ",0,0
129," The biggest mistake I made was actually a structural flaw of the incubator/accelerator I participated in. The explicit requirement of the program was to apply without having yet committed to any co-founders. This stands in stark contrast to every other major incubator that just about requires your founding team to already be formed – and to have been working together for a long time and, ideally, to already have some demonstrated traction – before you apply. This is one reason my accelerator program ended after just 2 batches – it was clear the solo-applicant model does not work. When I look back, all our product and customer development struggles, the long philosophical debates, etc, stemmed from the fact that the founders simply didn’t know each other well. And as we got to know each other, we realized our goals, motivations, and values differed from one another – on some issues only a little bit, but on other issues a great deal. The #1 reason startups fail is because the founders quit or break up, resulting in startup suicide. This is what happened to us. In retrospect, the “right way” to join any incubator is to have your founding team already formed and with a reasonably long track record of working together. That’s probably the biggest thing you can do to de-risk your startup. Mistakes and market challenges are bound to arise, but that’s OK because your product and ideas will drastically change as you learn about your customers and market. What you cannot change are the co-founders you start the journey with because, frankly, people don’t change. So you have to be sure you know your co-founders well enough, both personally and in terms of work style, to feel confident that, as a team, you’re able to go the distance. ‍",0,0
130," We really needed to refine our message and get better at succinctly communicating. The project was a fairly complicated one, and it was easy to lose people when describing it. More than anything else, though, we should have consulted with a marketing pro to get the word out better.                                                                                                                                             ",0,0
131," It’s always hard to be the first. Mubert was the startup that presented generative music to the world. I mean it. As a result, the biggest obstacle was that it was tough to explain what generative music is. But when people get what it is, the first word is WOW! Due to this, we faced obstacles with new users and sales as people didn’t know that they needed it. We tried hard to bring our mission to our users with the help of other artists and influencers, blog articles, etc. As time passed, we began to have competitors. And in fact, their appearance also helped convey the correct understanding and value of generative music in the modern world.  Moreover, someone may think that all our pivots resulted from previous mistakes made in product or marketing. But I wouldn’t say so. Every pivot gave us a new breath and a new product. All our previous products still exist and work. More than that, all of them create the massive ecosystem around music and content creation that I always dreamt about.  ",1,0
132," The biggest challenge, and a mistake at the same time—as is often—is pushing through even after launch the only thing you hear is crickets. Which means: having a solid marketing plan for post-launch. Continue to interact with new and existing users, helping them solving small pains by creating useful resources, like blogs, video's, guides and more. When day after day, you get people to visit your marketing pages but don't follow-through you start to doubt the product. I did the same, but the messaging could as well be wrong, or the packaging not enticing enough. Fact is I just looked at those bare numbers, without trying to dissect what they really meant. The other big mistake was outsourcing some things prematurely, like the product tour video. If you ask me now, I don't think a product tour video is the best way for a web-based product. Rather spend the time to set up a proper (working) demo or make sign up as unobtrusive as possible. ‍",0,0
133," It’s pretty clear that coronavirus has presented the biggest challenge for our journey so far, but we are learning to navigate it. It really forced us to make hard decisions quickly to best position ourselves to get through the crisis and have a business that can succeed in a recessionary environment. The big decision was transitioning our business model from an UberEats-style model to a more Airbnb-inspired model - helping customers seeking value not convenience.  What I mean by that is our original value proposition was driven by the ‘we can pick up your car for you so you don’t have to visit the garage’.  Now it’s driven by ‘we’ve vetted these garages so you can trust you’re getting value for money’. That’s got more longevity in the current environment where customers are watching their cash a bit more closely. We still want to offer pick-up but there’s a bit of a question mark over the wanted-ness of that service, and whether people will be willing to pay for it. ‍",1,0
134," The biggest challenge is trying to transition from a hobby project to a profitable business. Everyone who has experienced this inevitably has been at the point of trying to balance his daily job with the evermore time-consuming startup. To me, it feels like trying to juggle while climbing stairs - you have to concentrate really hard for really long stretches of time to make this work. Especially, when talking about a hardware startup the challenges can be tremendous - just the number of areas in which the founders should have expertise is imposing: Industrial Design, Engineering,  Manufacturing, Marketing, Finance, Business administration, Law and Shipping are just some of those. (in our case we could add - physics and vehicle handling/design)Of course, when it comes to challenges it all comes to how committed and how well connected you are. Big thanks to all the people that helped us with the project :)  Our larger mistake - not starting with the customer in mind. Every startup should start with a precise idea of who their customer is and what value they bring to them (what problem they solve).  Another rookie mistake - trying to build a product the satisfies everyone. Feedback is great, but not every feedback should prompt you to change your idea or start adding features. Building Minimum Viable Product is key here - the minimal subset of features that is sufficient to solve the customer’s problem. Sticking with the three-wheel configuration was the most time-consuming mistake we made. It’s more expensive, not as nice to drive and we were not even sure why we came up with it in the first place.  Always, make a specification sheet, before trying to make hardware product and stick to it - no unnecessary features.   ‍",1,0
135," The biggest challenge is managing clients you work with – there are a lot of different personalities and different expectations. In order to manage these expectations, we now have a contract signed by every client so they know what to expect from us and to protect us from complaints. I tend to reject customers – I now just feel what kind of client they're going to be and if they're not very responsive.  One of the worst things that happened to NerdPilots was with a bad developer who was managing a lot of clients but suddenly stopped being available. It has been a big issue over the last couple of months as we had to move his work over to new developers. But as far as disadvantages, I don't really think we have any. We have also committed a few mistakes starting projects or waiting for clients to deliver us needed information for a long time, which has meant losing some clients. We're working right now on trying to make sure the clients have the same expectations that we have. ‍",1,0
136," When I launched on Product Hunt, one of the reviews pointed out that this idea is really cool, but the guy is dreadfully dull. During that time I was doing video tutorials. I didn't know what I was doing. I was just recording and trying to follow a script. It's a lot more difficult than people think, a lot more goes into it. I probably wasn't doing enough to make a really good production, but I was seeing where it was going. At that time, I was still in the mindset of every startup has to grow 10% every week and then you go to Y Combinator. Then you get funded by VCs and it's got to become a huge thing. I saw other startups through Indie Hackers that were doing well by themselves growing at a slower pace and I wanted to do it that way. To build the platform, I got a friend of mine, Mubashar Iqbal, who builds tons of things. He's a technical guy and a prolific maker. I wanted to build it in a way that could scale, which was far too early. There was no need to be doing that. “I was chasing what I thought was the right thing rather than listening to what people enjoyed.” Soon enough, I didn't recognize our product as what we were trying to do. I was not really sure what I was selling, how I was selling it, or who I was selling it to. There were some videos, but actually, we got another feature that we were trying companies to sign up for. We were doing too many things at the same time and it became a bit of a mess. After a few months, I felt that I needed to shut it down, as I didn't know what the platform was becoming. “Promising weekly screencasts is a big thing to do and when motivation is down from the slow growth, it can be an even tougher ask!” ‍",0,0
137," We really made a ton of mistakes until we found and defined the right attributes a partner should have in order to be a good fit for our business.  Early on, one of the biggest mistakes we made was taking on clients who are trying to scale before they had a clear product-market fit. As a founder, I want to help them, but that led to a lot of frustration for my team. We've become a lot more selective with the clients we bring on and considerably improved at setting and managing expectations with our new clients. We also stopped taking clients that are looking for a single channel to optimize without owning or being able to influence the journey we are sending users into. In addition, we limited the industries and stages of startups or scale-ups to work with. It's really all about the fit for our model so we can maintain the quality of work and retention rate we have always had. ‍",1,0
138," When working with my cousins and friends, I realized that it was hard to administer a frank and withering appraisal on their work performance, mainly because I didn’t want to risk hurting our relationship. That decision might have led to unaddressed faults and caused operational issues to continue longer than they should have. Don’t get me wrong, working with friends and family can be a very enjoyable experience, but it definitely doesn’t come without challenges and there’s always the risk of spoiling your relationship. If I could go back in time, I would be more professional in dealing with my “co-founders” and not see them as friends or family while we’re working together. ",0,0
139," Outside of the lack of capital, the timeline had a lot of challenges: Lack of product development expertise until very late in the project — didn’t get a product designer until 6 months in.Non-optimal co-founder — I was single and able to make it my top priority. My partner had a full-time job, had two kids and a wife, and was in Tokyo still after I moved back to the USA.Lack of experience in the survival/prepping industry — for both myself and my co-founder. This caused us to be over-reliant on third parties for reviewing, which slowed down the project considerably.Working on too much at once - in addition to building Okami Pack, I was still trying to make my online blog successful and throw music events with the hope it would pay my life expenses (it didn’t.)Not networking with successful Kickstarter founders  — I didn’t do this until far too late in the process. I realized it took some of them YEARS to launch. Personal issues — I had an impactful death in the family. My Mom passed away suddenly halfway through the project in January 2015. Instead of grieving, I put much of this focus back into the project when I should have likely paused the project and re-evaluated my life.  Many of the avoidable challenges & mistakes really came down to a lack of product development experience and not accurately assessing living and capital expenses over a long time horizon (9 months).‍ Additionally, the “profit share” payout for the team had some major flaws and wasn’t well thought out. Had I launched the project, this likely would have led to some serious cash flow problems as we were starting a business and did not have a financial road map that took accurately took their profit shares into account.",0,0
140," COVID was our biggest challenge. In 2020, retailers weren’t interested in putting fancy installations in their stores. They were far more concerned about how to stay in business.  However, the other huge challenge - and where I made a lot of mistakes - was finding the right team. Like many tech entrepreneurs, I know what makes a good developer, and I like to think I’m pretty good at hiring developers. Hiring sales and marketing people, however, that’s a whole different story.   I’ve spent years with these products, and I know them intimately. I understand the customers and their needs, and I’ve gotten pretty good at selling to them. However, finding people who are the right cultural fit for Ombori and training them to sell our products has been a big problem for me. There’s so much knowledge locked up in my head, and a lot of it is almost instinctive now, and not easy to explain. Tied in with that is something that almost every entrepreneur will relate to - it’s really easy to get burned out because you’re trying to manage everything. Writing the code, doing the selling, directing the marketing, meeting partners, raising funds, paying the bills - you have to take care of it all and it’s really hard to let it go. Then, you become a bottleneck, because everyone else is waiting on you, and you just can’t keep up.  It’s not an ego thing, where you want to keep control of everything. It’s more a sense of fear - you feel like you have to do everything because you’re the only person who knows what’s going on. At the same time, you’re so busy that you don’t even have time to delegate a job and brief someone else so that they can take it off you. At some point, you have to make the time, empower someone else to do the job, and let them get on with it - even if you could have done it better. ‍",1,0
141," As indicated before, the biggest challenge, in my opinion, was to fund the thing. There have always been technological challenges, but we’re pretty good at solving these. Hardware is expensive though, and your product needs to be finished before you can start selling. So, the first challenge, in my opinion, was to fund the prototype development and marketing cost needed to launch our crowdfunding campaign. The second challenge was actually delivering in time, and here, you don’t have everything in hand. It’s hard to get from prototype to full-fledged product in a few months and to get everything produced in time. Especially when you’re the only one able to process your material. We were literally forced to start our own factory, with a special custom-made machine to produce the canoes. Doing that in 9 months proved pretty challenging, especially because one of our manufacturers was 4 months late and another one could not deliver on time at all and had to be replaced. The last major challenge for ONAK itself is overcoming the fact that the product is very seasonal. Demand is high during summer, low in winter. This has its advantages and disadvantages, but the biggest problem for us here is that it means that you need a lot of time to see a growth pattern and the amount of stock needed is hard to predict the first years. That combined with the fact that many pieces need to be ordered months upfront and in big batches, the effect of this is not to be underestimated. Order too little material and you lose sales, order too much and you risk running out of money while having 100 thousands of euros laying in stock. This is one of the reasons why we try to work as much as possible with local manufacturers that can deliver quickly and in smaller amounts. We’re also working on less seasonal applications of our material. In personal life, the financial burden of starting a startup, especially in the beginning, combined with the work pressure, can be quite hard. It is important to keep a good balance here and to know what you’re getting yourself into.  I think this was assuming that sales would automatically go as fast as during the crowdfunding once we could deliver for real and that we would not need retailers during the start. A lot of marketing is needed though, and people need to time and a place to touch / try the product before acquiring a high-priced leisure product like ours. So, we quickly reconsidered this and are actively working with retailers and distributors now. We honestly also underestimated the difficulty of making the buildup process fool-proof. We’ve gotten a ton better than a year ago, but we’re still working on this and this is so important, especially when you start working with resellers. Another mistake was putting too much trust in the wrong manufacturers. If you depend on one or more, check their track record and make sure they know what they’re doing and will be able to deliver in time. We had one manufacturer that offered to do a lot for us, which sounded awesomely simple, but wasn’t. This manufacturer was no specialist in many parts of what they offered to do, leading to a delay of 4 months! Choosing specialized manufacturers would have been a lot faster and cheaper. ‍",1,0
142," I think that failure is something that every online entrepreneur talks about, and for me, this was the biggest obstacle that I faced. I can't tell you how many different projects I tried and failed at.  I recall at one point creating videos on YouTube in an effort to get affiliate commissions through that channel, that didn't work. I recall creating at least a dozen websites in various niches and they failed miserably because I had no idea what I was doing. In fact, even with One Hour Professor I technically failed right from the start because the business model I originally chose didn't work. For me, the failure itself is only failure if I don’t learn anything. I would say that many of these failures were a blessing because they taught me a lot of great things on what I need to do and, more importantly, what I shouldn't do. In terms of the other biggest challenges that I’ve faced, I was definitely blessed in that I had some Internet marketing knowledge prior to embarking on this journey, but web design is not a point of strength for me. I'm still not a web designer, but I was able to find tools that helped me in creating (good enough) looking websites. Personally, I use Thrive Themes to create my websites and that's been an absolute godsend in helping me be successful.  My final challenge, and I would say that this is still a challenge, is trying to have a work/life balance. My wife yells at me nearly every single day because I'm typically working too late into the night and I’ve found that this is because I'm so passionate about what I do that I don't even consider it work. That said, it's still something that I work on every single day and something that I struggle with because I truly enjoy what I do, but I obviously need to make room for my family in addition to work.    It's hard to answer this question because I'm not really focused only on the One Hour Professor website. That said, I do remember that I originally created the One Hour Professor website I focused far too much of my time on keyword research and basically, I was creating content that would get me some traffic but had absolutely no value for my business. For instance, I remember at one point I spent many hours creating a blog post about various social media facts. While this might have been an interesting topic, it didn't bring anybody into my website that I really wanted and it provided no business value whatsoever.  Beyond the One Hour Professor website, I'd say that the worst mistake I've committed to date is working on too many things at once. Like most entrepreneurs, I have the shiny object syndrome tend to have way too many ideas come to me at one time. Because of this, there have been numerous times when I started three or four different projects and only follow through on one of them. In order to really succeed with a website, you have to focus on first making it great.  Then, once you have that done, you can create procedures and hire great writers that consistently pump out quality content.  Once that’s done, you can hire an editor to manage everything and move to the next project. Nowadays, I'll never work on more than two projects at once. For me, this tends to work pretty well and I think that doing too many things at once is a very common mistake that most people need to avoid if they want to succeed. My personal advice is to only work on one project at a time and put everything you have into it and be determined to succeed. If it does succeed, and you can create processes and build a team to manage it, then you can begin to work on other projects. This is the exact path that I've taken (after many failures) and it's worked out pretty well so far.",1,0
143," As mentioned earlier, FUD has been, and still is a big issue from to time. Since you’re entering uncharted waters almost on a daily basis, you’re often on your own in figuring out what to do next or how to handle a certain issue. Sure, there are places you can turn to for advice, however, although well meant, advice is always based on the giver’s personal situation and circumstances and does not always help you. Another big issue for us at the moment is dealing with and scaling customer support. Up until recently, I and my main developer were handling most of the support requests. This obviously is not a good thing, as it drastically slows down our development efforts and delays future releases. As we need to reach product market asap, we’re scrambling to move both of us away from support. Other than that, we deal with the typical obstacles any software company faces. Things like deciding which features to implement first, working on documentation, documenting internal processes, implementing automated QA, etc. Fortunately, most of these obstacles are of technical nature and fixing technical issues is what we coders do best ) Other personal obstacles for me are things like loneliness. Although it’s super easy to connect with people and gather like-minded people around you, building a bootstrapped business as a solo-founder is an inherently lonely undertaking. Nobody but you fully understand everything that’s on your plate. It’s up to you, and you alone, to make the decisions. ‍  We have spent a bunch of time and money on things which, in hindsight, we shouldn’t have. We wasted time and money on building a collection of 600 templates, which we never were able to complete (due to a variety of reasons). We have made some small “mistakes”, where we spend some time and resources developing features we did not end up releasing. Sometimes because halfway through the feature we found out it would end up being too costly or the demand was not as big as initially thought. Other mistakes were made releasing features too early, while they were not yet stable enough and not tested thoroughly. We probably also started focusing on automated QA a bit too late. One thing we got blindsided by was the large support burden we didn’t anticipate the support demand would be this big. I guess you could call this a mistake of sorts I probably should have done a better job cultivating our mailing list since we launched. Sending out regular drip campaigns with tutorials, how-to’s and other useful content could have been beneficial. ‍",1,0
144," One thing I have learned with park.io is that it can often seem like there is a big obstacle that is going to bring down the whole business, and yet usually you can find a way around it. One example is the .io registry decided to sell their own backorders only a few months after I started park.io. I thought I would surely have to close the site and quit, because how could I compete with the registry? Luckily our systems were different enough that there was still value in the service that park.io was providing. Also, I was able to incorporate their system and leverage it with our own. What I learned from this and other obstacles is that being a hacker with programming is similar to hacking a business to make it work. It's about being resourceful - you just need to find a way to make it work with the situation you find yourself in. ‍  The worst mistakes, in my opinion, are the mistakes that affected the users in a negative way. Like one time I sent a hundred duplicate emails to a user, or one time a user was charged three times for one order. Things like this cause me a lot of pain. I want to be helpful to my users and provide them with a service that makes their lives easier or better, so it hurts me to make mistakes that do the opposite of this. With mistakes like these I always try to reach out personally and be very honest about the situation, and I usually credit their account or offer something like this. I hope to turn it into something good for them. It is difficult for me to come up with mistakes, mostly because I believe that everything happens for a reason and even the things that seem to be the worst are actually great things. But one other thing I can think of is pretty early on I listed the company for sale on Empire Flippers. I thought to myself ""why not? There isn't really any risk and maybe I will sell the company."" But I think this was a mistake because it ended up taking a lot of time and energy. There were several calls, and many questions to be answered, many reports to gather. It was a lot of time and energy that I could have spent on the company and code. I would recommend to others not to list their company for sale unless they are sure they want to sell and are willing to devote the time to it. I was never really that interested in selling the company, and thankfully I did not sell it at the time. ‍",1,0
145," The biggest obstacle throughout the project was the technical build of the cross-platform apps. The next major challenge was creating all the content needed for Pathways. We needed to ensure the content was evidence-based, understandable by a large variety of people, and applicable to many different pain conditions. ‍  The biggest mistake was the somewhat rushed hire of our first React Native team. That set us back by almost a year. Although on the positive, this helped me to really understand the kind of team that would be needed to help this project excel. As a product, the disadvantages of it at the moment is that we haven’t run any medical trials that will help us quantify just how much it helps pain sufferers. That’s now a priority. ‍",1,0
146," There have been a ton of challenges and obstacles along the way. For starters, it’s never easy to have multiple owners, let alone 3, all of whom are pretty stubborn. This causes some issues where no one really wants to be told what to do and no one wants to tell any of the other owners what to do. Sometimes that creates some bottlenecks in communication, but the best way that we found was to just communicate. You have to talk to each other because you are going through this with several people. What we’ve done to sort of curb this is to have regular meetings, where we talk about upcoming projects, assign different action items, and hold each other accountable for the work. This helps keep us on track and continue to grow.  Another huge challenge that we face and continue to face is the fact that I have another job and I live in a whole other state. I put a lot of focus on Patriot Chimney, even when I’m at my job because I have a goal to eventually work for my company, but there are a lot of items on my docket and a to-do list that has to be placed on the back burner since I simply don’t have time. It’s also very difficult managing this company, a full-time job, a gym schedule, and my personal relationships, but I do it with a very well kept calendar. I use Trello for larger picture items and Asana for daily to do (and groceries). I have my time blocked so I know what I’m working on and when I’m working on it.  One disadvantage to our company that I mentioned earlier is that I’m in North Carolina, while the rest of the company is in Virginia. The problem with this is that there can be sort of a disconnect between me and the rest of the team since I don’t see what goes on every day. I try to make recommendations that, in my head seem to make sense, but don’t make sense at all for those actually doing the work. For example, when we were getting started, I wanted to get rid of paper condition reports, so we bought iPads and an app that would allow upload the condition reports, write on them with a stylus, upload to our Dropbox account, and then email them to the client. The issue with this is that it is very difficult to carry an iPad around when you’re climbing ladders and walking around on a steep roof.  What we do now is if I have an idea, I run it by Matt and Billy to see what they think. Lucky for me, both of them are ex-Marines (or once a Marine, always a Marine?) and they really don’t mind telling me that my idea doesn’t make sense. In all seriousness, they are both very strong critical thinkers and have a great way of analyzing these ideas and thinking of situations that I hadn’t even thought of. ",1,0
147," It’s hard to say we haven’t had challenges, because obviously not everything goes as planned, but for the most part we’ve been extremely fortunate and lucky thus far (knock on wood!) It’s been interesting trying to bootstrap this while not really working a full-time job, but it allows us plenty of time to focus on our company, and that’s extremely valuable. One thing I can say is it has definitely changed our personal lives, but I don’t find it to be negatively impacting us. I spend more time working on this now instead of being with family & friends, but I also think that is apart of chasing something you’re passionate about. I just need to remind myself more often than before to create time to see my parents and friends that aren’t in my general vicinity. It’s easy to get obsessive over things and not be able to let it go. This also goes with a saying a mentor of mine, Lain Henlsey, mentioned - “It’s not about perfection, it’s about connection.” I also like to think about the idea that getting something done is sometimes better than making something perfect. A lot of times we get caught up on being perfect, and that stops us from just getting it done in the first place. ‍  Again, there isn’t really a massive mistake that comes to mind. We also live with the mantra that there isn’t a mistake of failure as long as you’re learning from it. So, on that note, I will say, international shipping is extremely expensive, haha! Due to this realization, we’ve decided that for the foreseeable future, we will only be available in the United States - post Kickstarter. During the Kickstarter, we were available internationally, and after looking at shipping costs, it doesn’t make much sense. I wish we would have figured this out earlier, or made that decision before the Kickstarter, but for the few international backers, they will have a one-of-a-kind product for a little while, so hopefully, they enjoy using a rare item in their country until we decide to ship international again! It’s also interesting dealing with logistics and fulfillment on our own. We wanted to give it a try, but I would be lying if I said packaging 300+ units from a small bedroom wasn’t a bit draining. We hope to one day be able to give our business to a fulfillment team, that way we can focus on growing PEAR into the future as the company we imagine it can become.",1,0
148," The biggest mistake was probably just that it was a flawed concept, to begin with. Something like Steemit seems much more viable. But they have an actual cryptocurrency that backs their social media platform. I believe they have a whole team of developers. I’m just a web programming guy. It would take me years to get over the learning curve to build a cryptocurrency in C++, and I just have no desire, either. Phez was a very poor man’s Reddit. There was NO competitive advantage, other than the idea of getting rewarded for your content in Bitcoin. Sure, we had the concept of “free speech platform,” but there was already Voat, and that has just turned into a toxic echo-chamber itself. (That seems to be what happens when major social media platforms limit free speech. A certain kind of speech gets shuffled over to its own echo chamber, where it stews. I don’t think that’s the healthiest approach to speech on the Internet, but that’s just my opinion.) One big mistake was rewarding users in cryptocurrency (say, instead of just USD) in the year 2015 when it would happen to rise meteorically over the next few years. Hindsight is always 20/20, though. ‍",0,0

There are things on which I spent a lot of time without success, so I gave up, and that time did not contribute to Photopea in any way. I am not aware of any serious mistakes. Maybe Photopea could be much more advanced, popular, or profitable if I did something differently, but it is hard to tell. I am afraid of getting a business partner or an investor. I would feel quite uncomfortable having one. I am aware that this “fear” is not rational, and I could miss many opportunities. ‍",1,0
151," One challenge we had was Android QA. The team was covered on iPhones and we had three Android phones. The problem was that there is such a variety of Android phones that we were constantly battling bugs that we couldn’t reproduce in simulators or on the phones we had. We were mostly unsuccessful in managing this problem but we occasionally got lucky. In one case, a user emailed us complaining that our app didn’t work for her and she was going to leave a bad review (by the way, almost all of our inbound user emails were either appreciative and helpful or mean-spirited and hurtful). The initial email was vague and emotional, honestly like 99% of the emails. I responded immediately and made sure she knew she was being heard. I connected with her a bit and as our conversation continued over days, I was able to uncover all the technical details necessary to fix all the bugs she was experiencing. While performing a root cause analysis, I also got to know her as a person. She was very appreciative, and she ended up not leaving a negative rating. This was just one of many times that I’ve been able to successfully interact with disgruntled users. Applying empathy and mindful listening to diffuse difficult situations while applying principles like the 5 Whys and the MomTest has been successful in turning detractors into advocates. Another interesting challenge with making a friendship-only app was that people genuinely did not seem to only want platonic relationships. About half of our users wanted to use the app to date new people. We could’ve banned or prevented signups from these romance-seeking users, but this would’ve meant (1) ignoring what our user base was telling us they wanted, (2) taking the time to prune our existing user base and throttling signups, (3) missing a good opportunity to learn how to achieve better product-market fit, and (4) potentially lowering the quality of our playdates by decreasing user density. On the other hand, we could’ve let them stay, but that would mean (1) compromising our values and turning Playdate into what amounted to another dating app with a twist, (2) converting from a friendship-only app to a friendship-and-relationship app likely too early (it’s easier to go from friendship to both over relationship to both, but once you make that leap it’s irreversible), and (3) making about half the playdates incompatible because one person would want just a friend while the other would want more. We ended up finding a compromise by adding a new feature called “looking for.” It was basically a user-selected flag for “strictly friends” or “maybe more.” This essentially split our user base in two but allowed us to continue to serve both types of users and gather data and feedback about both. Also, don’t hire any interns for a while. It is decidedly negative expected value. ‍",0,0
152," Underfinancing has been the biggest bottleneck in the early days of Plutoview.  One sales experiment that failed was bringing in an ex-CMO as our interim head of sales. We thought that the experience of this ex-CMO would help us upgrade our sales structure, but in reality, it brought close to no results. This was when we learned that you have to be careful in placing extensive expectations on new hires and that it’s always better to grow your talent in-house.  ",1,0
153," Wow! Lots of obstacles. In the beginning, everything was going swimmingly. I felt the Universe was helping me, that was my destiny – I filed the patent and hired a marketing agency. This didn’t work out too well. They were super nice people but I think we were just not on the same page on what I expected the deliverables to be, so it was an uphill battle ever since. I’m basically the general contractor now and I have to find a lot of subs to help me cross the finish line. It was really bumpy for 3 weeks, but some of the consultants I’m working with really came thru for me like Declan Dunn, who is a veteran online marketer. I’m super lucky that I have a supportive husband. Since I also manage our family money, I haven’t told him quite yet how much I am spending. I hope that I just get to show him a higher bank account balance than before I started this project. All kidding aside, I am super grateful to have a supportive family and friends. I will say that I knew that if I didn’t do this, it would be because I chickened out, and it wouldn’t have been for lack of resources but a lack of courage. Life is short and I don’t want to wish that I pursued this project when I didn’t. Don’t want to live in regrets. 	 ‍  We’re still at the early stage. I hired a marketing agency that helps with Kickstarter launches. I super like the people who work there. But early on, I started getting the feeling that we’re not on the same page. There were several things that I was questioning, and long story short, I kept waiting and hoping that things would improve. I did attempt to clarify things, but after several times, I should have listened to my gut that it wasn’t going to work out. ‍",1,1
154," The first challenge I experienced was the fact that I simply did not know the enterprise market well enough. Being from Serbia can be a serious handicap. When a potential client approaches you, you simply are not aware of his size, nor the fact that your fees are ridiculously low for him. It took me a while to understand that I needed to offer a variety of services, low-end for small/medium businesses and high-end for enterprise ones. Next thing: In the early stages of the business I was lucky to hire some talented young guys, for whom Price2Spy was the very first job. The challenge comes 4-5 years down the road, when a young engineer wants to make a move (either because he wants to learn new technologies or to change business focus, or simply leave Serbia). It will be very difficult to keep such a guy, no matter how happy you try to make him. 2015, 2016 and 2017 were tough for me because I lost some very valuable developers this way. I have tried to solve this by hiring seniors, which did not work well so now I’m back to the proven tactics: I keep getting fresh young developers, who (if they stay long enough) will become very productive until the moment when they leave when they will get replaced by the younger ones. An important part of our selection process is a psychological evaluation. This helps us understand which candidates are a good fit for long-term employment. The 3rd challenge can be described as ‘victims of our own success’. Basically, when starting this business, development resources in Serbia were abundant and thus pretty affordable. As you can imagine, we were not the only that enjoyed such a success. Over time, hundreds of western companies opened their development offices in Serbia, and thousands of small Serbian businesses popped up, offering outsourced software service globally. This resulted in 2 problems: A steep rise in development salaries.Lare deficit of experienced development resources. As for personal life, I was lucky enough that my wife was patient enough and full of understanding with myself being constantly connected, no matter if we’re traveling for a skating contest (both of our daughters are in figure skating) or on a long-deserved holiday.   Being from Serbia can be considered both as an advantage (lower project costs) and as a disadvantage (no experience with enterprise clients). I wish I had a business partner from the western world who would be in charge of sales and marketing, while I could run operations and R&D.  Over time we have learned that some of our competitors have solved some problems in a technologically much more advanced way than we did. Each time we identify such a situation, we try to improve our technology stack. This can be cumbersome, as it means even higher development costs. But I consider it important in order not to lose pace on the market. Lack of ambition (‘moderate ambition’ as I prefer to call it) may be another disadvantage. Very few IT businesses are happy with 25-30% annual growth. On the other hand, I consider it good enough in the long run. There is a Serbian saying that could be translated as: ‘’Those who fly high, will fall down low’. I pay too much attention to ‘legacy projects’. We have software development clients from 12-13 years ago, which are becoming more of a burden, rather than being profitable. I find it difficult to say goodbye to such clients. I feel that I have to keep my commitment, although they are not my main focus anymore. Speaking of staff, for quite a long time I was thinking that certain important people couldn’t be replaced. This led to really awkward situations, which were by no means good for the business. And once those people left, I learned that they could, in fact, be replaced and that some replacements worked even better than the one who had left. On the side, I sometimes take businesses too personally. Winning an important client gets me really high, losing a client can take me really low. I can get really passionate in arguments, as well. I’m far from perfect CEO, but I’m trying to improve, and I’m willing to learn.  ‍",1,0
155," The biggest challenge faced, over my entire career, has probably been working as a solo founder. I have worked with partners in the past and I have some smaller side projects that I run with partners, such as co-hosting a podcast and co-running a small conference. I like those kinds of small partnerships, but when it comes to my main business, I have just never really found out a great business partner to build an entire company with. I'm friends with a lot of really great talented founders, but they're all working on their other things.  The way I've overcome working as a solo founder is by befriending and being part of communities. I travel out to conferences and I've met a lot of friends through that. Now my friends and I get together three or four times a year at small retreats where we go and do something fun, like skiing and snowboarding, and then we talk business. We even, personally and through Slack, try to advise each other on our businesses. I would definitely recommend getting involved in some communities to anyone, whether you have partners or not. It can really do wonders for your career just meeting people and learning and sharing notes along the way.   I always feel like I'm at a bit of disadvantage of being a solo person. I have seen how partnerships can work out really well and you can get work done very efficiently, so being soles founders puts me behind the competition with a team of founders. However, over the years, I've become much more comfortable in that role of driving everything forward myself again. I overcame that by relying pretty heavily on my advisors and friends, other founder friends and mentors. Some of the worst mistakes are also sort of related to partnerships. In the years ago, I partnered up with a few people with whom I didn't have a history. I think that within 30 days of meeting them, we decided to partner up on a product idea and we just didn't really see eye to eye on things. Needless to say that that partnership didn't work out. If you are going to partner with someone, I think you need to have a prior working relationship with him/her. Of course, it also has to make sense in terms of skills and finances. The other thing I commit a mistake with was not learning back-end technologies until 2018. I feel like I should have done it sooner in my career. I’ve always stayed away from Javascript, Ruby, databases, etc because I felt like I wasn't that type of developer for too many years. When I decided to devote my time to it, I actually learned a lot and I felt really comfortable with it. Nowadays, it’s something I really love. ",1,0

I tried to look for an alternative, but I needed to learn their documentation, and it required a lot of development time My biggest mistake was spending too much time on trying to create a good design. Even though the app was simple, I didn’t want it to have an evil design. Because of my lack of front-end skills, I spent a lot of time tweaking CSS and JavaScript code to meet the design I wanted. I think it would have been better to hire someone to design it for me.",0,0
157," The biggest obstacles for me have been doubting myself and being a perfectionist. As a solo founder, it can be difficult to stay positive and motivated. I think all creative people deal with fears of being rejected or failing. When you invest so much of yourself into creating something it can be very scary to put it out there. Sometimes I get down about stupid things. For example, if I have one week where my signups decrease or a customer I admire doesn’t purchase a subscription, I start to get negative thoughts. It’s a very stupid thing because my business is growing well and I know I am lucky to be in the position I am.  Another problem I have is being a perfectionist. It’s easy for me to go down rabbit holes and labor over details that aren’t practically benefiting my business. For example, I’ve had to stop myself from wasting time overly refactoring code or redesigning something that looks good enough. I think being a perfectionist can really backfire because when you start over scrutinizing your work, you often end up making it worse. For example, when I was working on my responses for a written interview I started word-smithing things to the point where I was making it longer and more boring. I had my brother and a couple of my friends rescue me by proofreading and telling me to stop.  One big mistake that I continue to make is building large features without testing and validating them along the way. For example, Pull Reminders currently has some reporting features that I don’t think anyone is getting a lot of value out of. I spoke to customers about it before I started and had a good idea of the problems I was trying to solve, but designing reports and data visualizations is very hard without a deep understanding of how, who, and when they’ll be used. As a result, I created something that wasn’t quite the right solution. It would have been better for me to take the process slower and show users mockups of what I could build before I actually built it. I’m now redesigning a lot of my reports based on what I’ve learned, but I could have gotten to the same point faster with a better process. Another mistake I made was spending way too much time and energy trying to get a new logo designed. The logo I have now was designed by me, but a couple of months ago I became infatuated with the idea of creating a cute illustrated logo that was “bot” themed. I spent lots of time reaching out to various designers, writing up briefs, and iterating on different design concepts. Ultimately, I didn’t like any of the concepts and realized my current logo was perfectly good enough. I wasted a lot of time on that whole process which wouldn’t have really made a difference even if it had been successful. ‍",1,0
158," The first obstacle was actually before we opened our studio. It is kind of beaten into your head that if you want to start a business, you need to get funding. So, I tossed the idea of getting a business loan. I hated the idea of debt because I have done the student loan rodeo and it is such a downer. So instead, my business partner (and mom) decided to make a go of it without a huge bank loan. Instead, we saved up enough for 6 months of rent and approached the landlord of building with our idea. We wanted to pay 6 months of rent up front if he would knock $200 of rent off per month. Miraculously, he agreed. So we had 6 months of wiggle room to figure things out before we had to turn a profit and actually HAD to pay rent. This was such a great buffer for us. We also decided that we would share our space for the first year while we figured things out.  We split the rent with a woman who was a costume maker. Her business was similar to ours, but different enough where we wouldn’t compete. She ended up staying with us for 4 years and the partnership worked out really well. It cut down on overhead, and we both were able to bounce ideas off each other. Another obstacle was actually figuring out our process. Now, this sounds crazy, but we started a business that we had zero experience in. I had built puppets and dyed fabric just for myself, but never professionally. And when I say I built puppets, I made 4 in total. That’s 4 yards of fleece I dyed before I launched into a business. I was dyeing the fleece in a plastic tub in my kitchen. But, I knew there was a need for dyed fleece and began to research how to do it on a larger scale. When I first launched, I was dyeing every piece in my washing machine using Rit dye which is what I call, “the gateway dye.” It is available at every craft store and grocery store. So, I bought a bunch of colors and off I went. The challenge came when I tried to recreate the same color twice. Rit has dye particles in it for all sorts of fabric types. So, you dump the dye it, and the dye particles for nylon stick to the fabric and the ones for cotton go down the drain. When you dump out 2oz of the dye into the dyebath, there’s really no way of knowing how many nylon particles are in there. One run might come out darker or lighter even if you put the same 2oz of dye in. I found this SUPER frustrating and it created a lot of waste. I also wanted a way to dye more yardage at a time. So, I began researching other methods of dyeing. Because there’s not a “how-to-dye-puppet-fleece” tutorial online, I started looking at what costume shops were doing. The gal we were sharing our space with was the perfect resource. She had a connection with the Utah Shakespeare Festival, and they had a DYE ROOM! So, we took a day trip out there to meet with their head of costuming for a tour of their space. What an amazing experience. This trip really took our business to the next level. We were able to talk to a guy who not only had dyeing experience but could help us figure out the equipment we need. Ironically, the item we really needed was a GIGANTIC soup pot.  We also were introduced to acid dyes. They are a much more stable dye where you measure the pigment out exactly, based on the weight of the fabric. So, every run of that color comes out the same. SO BRILLIANT. With the knowledge we needed to switch to acid dyes and purchase a giant soup pot, we took a leap of faith and financed the equipment. Our 60-gallon soup pot, whom we lovingly call Gertrude, was over $10,000. She was our first real investment into the business. When she arrived, we had to learn the new process of dyeing with acid dyes. We had to just try colors out to see what happened. We had to rebuild our swatch library from scratch because the Rit dye wasn’t compatible with Gertrude. Again, there was a ton of trial and error and figuring out our process. But, I feel we are finally in a place now where we have everything down and can call ourselves “professionals.” ‍  The biggest mistake was in our pricing. When we first started, we priced the fabric based on materials, but not really our time. So, about a year into it, we raised our prices. I was so nervous to do so. I thought people wouldn’t buy our fleece anymore and that everyone would be mad. Basically, I was reacting with my heart, not my brain. What I learned though was, if the product is good quality, people will buy it even at a higher price. We opted to have a range in price so we wouldn’t price anyone out of using the fleece. Our value for Core Colors starts at $27 per yard. These are either mill-dyed in bulk, or dyed by us in large batches. They are typically in stock at all times and have your basic color selection. If you want something a bit different, or an usual shade, you will pay more for the premium colors. We have found that new builders who want access to the fleece will splurge to buy a yard at $27, but maybe not $38 for a premium color. Once they get better at building, they then will move up to the more expensive pieces.  ",1,1
159," It seems obvious that once we’d invented a better way to sit we would partner with a large office chair company and let them do the heavy lifting of manufacturing and distribution. But despite my best efforts, I couldn’t get “Big Chair” (Steelcase, Heman Miller, etc.) interested. They seem to be fixed in their approach to sitting, and new ideas simply weren’t welcome. But it’s been ever thus: as the famed Nobel Laureate Max Plank observed over 100 years ago: “A new truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.” So, we’re busy upending what a chair is. Eventually, the Steelcase’s of the world will wake up, but by then it may be too late for them. So, I’d say our biggest obstacle has been “Big Chair”. These guys have defined what a chair is for the last century: a chair must have a backrest, a footrest, armrests, a headrest, and the coup de grace, “lumbar support”. It’s hard for our chairs which sport none of these distractions to good posture to be taken seriously. But slowly, slowly, our take on sitting is gaining ground. It’s hard to say where the tipping point is but we’re getting there. We haven’t made any catastrophic mistakes yet, but I’m pretty sure we will. It’s impossible to get everything right. I’m quite happy to place “little bets” that may or may not work out. What I’m very cautious about is making big bets, because if a big bet doesn’t pan out, well, you may lose your company and all the hard work that your team has put into the project. ",1,0
160," The biggest disadvantage was my lack of knowledge about coding. I had to hire freelancers to correct any errors on the site. If I was a coder, this would have made it easier for me to keep operating the site. And I think that if the whole site would have been built in WordPress, it would have been easier for me to operate. My knowledge about WordPress is sufficient and I can operate a WordPress site easily.",0,0
161," The first month went by testing the link-building process. I tested to see how would the guides look and how long it takes to create each guide. I built more than a hundred backlinks before I felt sure that I could create a website and sell it as a service.  Also, I had to make sure that I have proof that the backlinks from my database give results. So, when I started building the database, I built the links for two of my newest sites.  It usually takes several months for backlinks to take an effect. At the moment of the launch, I had no real results to show. But lately, both of my sites saw a huge spike in traffic and reach. Here you can see the impact of the links to my sites. Stats are from Google Search Console. The first site was made in October 2018. The second one was made in August 2018. 1st site:  ‍ 2nd site:  ‍ Based on these results, I hope they’ll have a positive impact on sales.  Another challenge was building the website since there aren’t that many WordPress themes that support subscription-based model.  I didn’t want to spend too much on a website which I wasn’t sure was going to pay off. So, I bought a theme and had to work with it. Since I’m not a coder or a designer, I had a hard time adjusting the theme for my needs. I really don’t like building websites. It took me two weeks to make it decent. I’m sure for others it would take a day.  I’m not 100% satisfied with how the website looks now but it’s the best I can do with my skill set at the moment.   To be honest, I haven’t made any real mistakes yet as the service is only a bit more than a month old.  I’m trying to find a way on how to build the database larger as fast as I can. I’m thinking of finding a freelancer who could help me since I have lists of hundreds of sites to be made into guides. But they all take a lot of time to create.  Finding a reliable and smart assistant is my biggest concern now.  ‍",1,0
162," It was apparent from day one that we’re doing something different. l though the concept of getting started was quite easy, but the beginning wasn’t so smooth. As a complete newcomer in the industry, we ran into several unexpected obstacles and challenges.  There were financial constraints and the worst part was that we didn’t have a mentor or a good team or great experience or a fail-safe business plan to survive in this industry. We have had plenty of bad days, but what always kept us going was a strong belief in ourselves and our idea. There was a lot of struggles to find the right resources, a team with enough pool of employees and mostly, align our offerings to our customers’ interests. Despite anything, we have focused on a detail-oriented approach with top quality offerings and economic pricing right from the beginning. That’s what absolutely resonates with our end users and throughout made us a highly recommended choice among our customers.  In fact, it’s thanks to our genuine efforts and unwavering determination that we have now come a long way. However, I think tackling challenges is something ongoing and unstoppable as the industry is ever evolving, bringing in many uncertainties every now and then. You should be therefore always prepared to confront improbable situations and devise innovative solutions which effectively respond to the most difficult of problems.  ‍  We have made lots of mistakes in the process of building Rayna Tours, but especially these were what encouraged us to move forward with confidence. In fact, every failure has given us only a valuable lesson. So I believe that there is nothing as mistakes. I would rather refer to them as experiments which turn you away from repeating the same folly again. So don’t be afraid to commit mistakes or more precisely experiment with your thoughts and ideas. You’re only winning when you learn and take home some valuable lessons from your slip-ups.  ‍",1,0
163," My biggest mistake, by far, was throwing good time after bad even though the market was telling me there was no demand for my product. I was doing a lot of things right - researching the market, talking to lots of people, getting the POC in front of the audience I hoped would buy, asking hard questions - but I simply didn’t internalize what they were telling me. I could have saved myself months of work if I would have just opened my eyes to the reality of Readership’s potential during those early conversations with potential users.",0,0
164," The hardest part was the pivot away from Branch. First of all, the way you try to make a startup work is by giving it all you can. After doing that for two years and realizing it won’t work, it is really hard to find the energy to do it all again. Second of all, because the business was revenue-generating (especially WP Pusher) and had hundreds of customers, you suddenly have 2 companies you run. Running the WP Pusher/Branch sales process on nights and weekends was also very hard. ",1,0
165,"  The initial challenge in any startup is to get the first set of users. We faced this challenge at Refrens also. We entered a crowded market with some of the players being at a very mature stage. Getting the first few users was the key. We called a lot of prospects and handheld them to lift their data from their existing platform to Refrens.  We were relying on growth through the marketing of the product. Although the product is free, as mentioned, our target audience is used to getting an in-person demo and extensive hand-holding for initial adoption. We solved this through better design. Instead of designing like a traditional invoicing system, we started with the assumption that our audience has never used an invoicing system before. This helped us win a lot of new customers.   I believe we are still evolving, every single day. I have a great team that is very agile and due to this, we can iterate fast to match our user’s expectations. ‍",1,0
166," I think we were too conservative with money. We would spend a little bit of money on a lot of things rather than more money on one thing and make sure that it would work. That's definitely something I learned in my current startup you want to be frugal but you also want to make sure that you can accept or deny the hypothesis you have 100%. As for disadvantages, the cultural difference was one. Note there were 8 hours of differences between us and the dev team.",0,0
167," The ultimate goal is that my businesses run themselves & my role becomes relatively passive. Currently Rent Round is far from that! The business needs my constant attention. While I find the challenge extremely exciting, it does require many hours of dedication a day. The biggest challenge is balancing my personal life & other businesses.  I had my 2nd child in December and the experience of raising a family is truly amazing. The challenge is ensuring I have the right balance in life. It’s an ongoing pivot between feeling you should be spending more time with your family vs. the guilt of neglecting the business. As Rent Round moves out of it’s ‘startup’ phase, the right balance is easier to achieve. I’m able to handover some activities to my team & switch off to enjoy my family time. Of course, there are exceptions in busy periods, but that's part and parcel of creating a businesses   I’d say my biggest disadvantage is I need to spread my time across multiple businesses, my property portfolio, martial arts club, Rent Round & my financial consultancy. When there are high priorities being raised across the businesses, certain things don’t get my attention as much as they should. In terms of mistakes, we were a victim of our own rapid growth towards the end of 2019. We were growing rapidly and the excitement got the best of me. I planned a large advertising campaign and I also had a number of technical upgrades in the pipeline. The upgrade was to take place over the weekend and the marketing was to start on the following Monday. Needless to say, there were issues with the upgrade, which meant the site wasn't working as it should have been. This resulted in a quite expensive advertising campaign not being as successful as planned. I’ve learned to be more composed and take a step back from my excitement from time to time, as hard as that is. Growth is infectious and momentum is important, but slowing down when required is a key skill to learn. ",1,0
168," I think one of the greatest challenges we faced was launching on to the global market from a place like Pakistan. Anyone will tell you that coming from a nascent country and making a mark on international business is really tough, and we did face a lot of troubles along the way. Our country wasn't really in the best position at the time, and we didn't have many of the conveniences that people in the West enjoy. Targeting cell phone and computer repair merchants in the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and other international borders has been difficult. People are often very skeptical of you if they learn you're from somewhere in South-East Asia. Building that first pool of customers was certainly a rough patch, but with enough perseverance, we've managed to break barriers and obtain the trust of merchants worldwide. One recent challenge that we faced was when one of our initial investors wanted to make an exit from the company. With the sudden news of our shareholder making their exit, we had to scramble to deal with acquiring their share and tailor our financial roadmap. It was certainly a tough time, but we managed to make the most of the situation, and I feel we did pretty good for ourselves. ‍",1,0
169," My biggest challenge regarding REPitchbook was building a user-friendly, secure prototype with my limited programming experience. I definitely made a lot of mistakes while building REPitchbook, and I’ll outline the 3 most important ones below. My first mistake was that I tried to add too many features to the initial product. The result of this was lots of features that felt half complete and clumsy, and no features that felt finished. I think this contributed to the poor, confusing user experience of the application. My second mistake was that I didn’t adjust for initial customer feedback pertaining to the product’s poor design. No one specifically said it, but 100% of agents were unable to use the application without instruction when I met them in person. I think it’s pretty safe to say that if users can’t use your application without guidance, you probably need to improve your UI / UX. My third mistake was that I didn’t validate the idea before I started building. I assumed real estate agents wanted to pitch potential clients using professional presentations. Almost none of them wanted to do that (they wanted to market to potential clients using email).",0,0
170," When it came to managing Reroute Lifestyle as a business, the biggest mindset I had to overcome was my money mindset. I transitioned from being a penny-pincher to being a business-owner allocating every penny earned. I’m trying to make calculated, strategic investments in my business instead of just letting any money earned sit in a bank account. Personally, the transition to self-employment was difficult. I was sick right after my last day at my day job. Of course, that week I moped around the house missing paid time off benefits. I also struggled to devote “full-time” work on this blog - and regularly. I didn’t know how to grow my task list so that I would spend 40 hours, or more, on the blog every week. Now, I try to balance: Promotion - Pinterest, SmarterQueue, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.Content Writing - at least 1 post, at least 1 email.Networking - interviews, guest-posting.Growth Analysis - audience behavior, affiliate performance, and email list growth.Side Projects - eBook writing, blog consulting. ‍ These tasks don’t fit into 40 hours per week yet, but I’ll get there one day. ‍  Constantly changing my mission and audience.  Again, I’m multi-passionate. I thought I could really niche down with Reroute Lifestyle. But as I kept writing for the blog, I realized that I’m happiest when I’m writing about multiple topics. This made growing hard. A lot of people follow me for my tips about affiliate marketing, but I want to branch out and write about travel and side hustles while traveling. I’m very cognizant of this, so I try to keep one main theme with my content: leveraging the internet to make money online, so you can work from anywhere. ‍",1,1
171," I knew that building an MVP was the way to go, but even if that was the case, I could have shared the progress much earlier and reduced time and costs. I remember feeling a little uneasy about showing my early progress, feeling the product was still not good enough. It was quite hard for me to slowly stop being shy about it. Big mistake! Later on, it was way harder to cut off all the features that I've already implemented and invested time in. Lesson learned: if you don't feel a bit uneasy while sharing your work in progress, then that is a clear sign that you should have shared it a long time before. ",1,0
172," Pricing was the hardest challenge because, with Twilio, I expected to pay 0.7 cents per text message with them. That doesn't sound like much, but it adds up fairly quickly. If a streamer has 200 subscribers on RingDaddy and they sent out a single text message that's gonna cost me $1.5. But let's say they do that 15 times a month. That's $22.5. The bigger they are, the more expensive it gets. I wouldn't say selling it to streamers was a challenge because they understood the value almost right away. There's a lot of remarketing potential. Streamers already have success. They know how to reach their audience. They know how to entertain their audience. They just don't have the right tools to remarket. But there was hesitation from their viewer base to subscribe. I think that's because people consider phone numbers a more personal thing. There was an educational element for viewers too. They were wondering: “What is it?” “Is this spam?”. When one big streamer posted it, the first comments were people thinking he got hacked. It's just such a weird thing to ask for people's phone numbers. ‍",0,0
173," I think I started too big. I should have kept it small, printing fewer t-shirts even if I wasn't earning anything, or event at a loss. That would have helped me validate the need for a platform like Ropero. Also, relying on a payment processor like PayPal was not a good idea, although there was literally no other option available. The main issue with PayPal is that you hand over the control and experience for the checkout to a third party, and it ends up plummeting the sales process. ‍",0,0

175," Being a bootstrapped startup, managing cash was always one of the biggest concerns. We started off by setting month-on-month goals to have a positive cash flow. This concern eased out gradually when we started creating a run-way for 3 months, 6 months. But we had to keep a tight leash on our spendings, and couldn't take exorbitant risks and tried to play it safe.  On the personal front, being an entrepreneur is a lonely journey. You don’t have too many people to talk to, get directions from. On some occasions, you question yourself. But you have to overcome them, pat yourself on the back when needed, since no one else can do it for you.  ‍  One of the greatest disadvantages was that both me and my co-founder did not have a solid idea on the business side of things. Both of us come from a technical background, we had to pretty much learn everything on our own, use the trial and error way. If we had a third founder from a business background, it would have helped us early on with the business.  I am waiting to create my worst mistake yet. ‍",1,0
176,"  A common challenge I face is that there seems to be candy everywhere as most of my growth strategy is SEO based, so basically people who want to send postcards find me. This makes it harder to develop deeper expertise in a field and really KNOW my customer’s customers and what makes them tick… so I can provide meaningful help for them down the funnel. Sometimes it's been a challenge as well to collect money from clients. Nowadays, I don’t run any campaigns until I get paid upfront. Oh and once my printer forgot to charge me $10,000 and they came to collect a year later. So, that was fun. ‍  I've been a victim of the “sunk cost fallacy” plenty of times. I had this moment actually yesterday where I found an interesting approach to target solar people by creating landing pages for them and I thought “why don't you just run Facebook ads at these people?”. It sometimes makes you wonder if you’re too committed to the product vs the outcome.  Another mistake has been not letting people go quicker. There are people that I like working with, but who just don’t produce results (for whatever reason). It’s hard to let go of someone, but sometimes you just need to cut the cord. It’s both a big mistake and something I hate to do. ‍",1,0
177," The main obstacle for us was having to get familiar with the technology. As Scraper API was a mature company during the acquisition, we wanted to ensure we understood what had already been set in stone, and how to make any changes when taking over. A scraping platform is not a highly scalable CURL (client URL) library. The source code virtually has years of experience hardcoded into it, with evidence of all the living past of what customers have asked for over the years. Looking at it is like looking at the age lines of a tree. While it was challenging to get accustomed to the product, we had a 6-month transition period in which Dan guided us. As head of the engineering team, one always has to juggle between working on killing off technical debt, satisfying the daily needs of our customers, and delivering new features and improvements. That's a difficult task and I know we don't always manage to do it the right way. An obstacle that the team faced before the acquisition was with accounting Dan has mentioned it would have been ideal to have hired someone earlier on to take care of it. Cleaning up finances and migrating to a new charging system was key to starting 2021 with a stable product, and with big plans. ‍",1,0
178," The first biggest misadventure so far we had with ScrapingBee was a legal one. Early on, ScrapingBee was called ScrapingNinja. We actually launched on ProductHunt with this name. 1 month after the PH launch we received an email from a French company claiming to own this name and asking us to change right away. This caused a lot of stress and made us lose a lot of time, and quite a bit of legal fees because we had to do a whole rebrand in less than one month. We had to say goodbye to all our SEO efforts, find a brand new name, do good legal research about it, find a new logo and communicate about it.  We are the only one to blame for that mistake, had we made more thorough brand name research before launching we would not have chosen ScrapingNinja. We will definitely not make this same mistake again. The second one was a motivation one, after working 8 months on PricingBot and seeing that nothing worked, we were really on the verge of quitting. We’ve known several people who were not able to give up a bad business idea soon enough and they ended up staying for as long as 5 years. One of our biggest fear was to be one of those people. On the other end, we knew that building a new business takes time and that you should not hope for overnight success because it almost never happens. So we were at the point where we did not know if we had to quit and we did not know if we had enough time to launch something else. We ended up building ScrapingBee because we knew we would never be sure of anything we’d better build something out of this uncertainty instead of just wondering. ‍  I’d say that our greatest disadvantage is that Kevin and I both have a full technical background. Neither of us has ever worked in web marketing before and we had to learn everything from the ground up. On the other hand, we’ve known each other for the last 15 years, so what we don’t have in complementarity, we like to think that we make up for it in terms of communication and getting along with each other very well. Secondly, we are completely bootstrapped, meaning that we can’t afford to waste money on costly experimentation. At least at the beginning, we had to be very careful about every one of our purchases. But as always, something good came out of this, because we could not afford to spend too much money we chose to get the maximum out of every tool we were already paying for, 80% of our business is now done solely with Notion and Slack and we learned a lot about the powerfulness of those tools. Now things are better, we had the chance to sell PricingBot last month, and in 2020 we will have much more money to spend. We can’t wait! I think that our biggest mistakes were made with PricingBot as explained before. I like to think that we did not make the same mistake twice with ScrapingBee. But right now, ScrapingBee is at a level we’ve never reached before with PricingBot, so we have lots of new mistakes to make, we just haven’t had enough time to make them yet. ‍",1,0

So, Scream Pretty is a little like a second child, that doesn't get as much attention as they deserve. I would love to find an extra day a week, or 2 more members of staff, then I feel I could get Scream Pretty in front of more people, as I think when people do find us, they like us and return - or buy gifts for their friends!

180," We’d built web projects previously, but Seomator was our first Saas and our first project with a fully remote team. So we made a lot of mistakes. I mean really a lot of them, and they were generally costly. For example, we spent a significant amount of time and money working on product localizations but realized later that keeping several languages up to date would cost us even more. And reaching those new markets wasn't bringing us enough customers to make it profitable. We also wanted to have both Stripe and Paypal as payment processing providers and spent near nine months building our own billing backend on the top of the Stripe and Paypal API’s. After nine months, we just trashed that code and went with Chargebee, which offered all the features we needed.  Dealing with remote developers was also a new beast. We had a full-time senior software developer on our team and a bunch of freelancers from all over the world working on various parts of our product. Obviously, we ended up dealing with all possible problems with freelancers: missed deadlines, bad code, overestimated work hours, developers disappearing when we needed to fix a critical bug, and so on and so on. We started using Hubstaff for employee time tracking and it did the trick.  ‍",1,0
181," One challenge SimpleLogin faced until now is the comparison with a very similar service that was launched just before us. Both products share a lot in common. It’s just tiring for us to be constantly compared, especially when SimpleLogin is still in beta. Now it becomes clear that SimpleLogin isn’t a copycat and offers a different set of features so the comparison is less frequent. The biggest mistake I made was to spend too much time building the single sign-on service without taking enough time to talk with app owners - those who would add our button in their apps. This is a classical mistake where the idea seemed so brilliant to us that it was hard to question it. Our biggest challenge at the moment is to explain why our product is needed. Most people consider privacy-focused products as difficult to use and are not willing to give them a try. Password managers had the same issue back then and hopefully, email aliases will become more mainstream in the future. ‍",1,0
182," I built what I thought people wanted instead of listening to what they needed. While my system was a thing of beauty from an aesthetic and engineering standpoint, it was almost useless for its intended purpose. Without the complete set of features, the system was not usable. My biggest mistake was that I spent too much time on infrastructure and tech without truly connecting with customers and understanding their core set of needs. From a technology point of view, the system was solid. It was all completely real-time and reactive but it lacked core features that should have been prioritized. I did not solicit feedback soon enough and the feature set was too deep. These mistakes cost large amounts of time and money and ultimately caused our failure.  Our competitors were also established and too far ahead for us to catch up to without a more significant runway. I should have been more discerning when choosing what to work on. Ultimately I severely underestimated the time it would take to develop the full feature set. We should have used our runway to target a smaller feature set, release an MVP and then iterate off of customer feedback. Customers are the core of any business. Without them, you don’t have a business.",0,0

184," The biggest challenge for us, and any business, is acquiring new customers. Marketing a service like ours is challenging, and getting our product in front of a small-ish audience is hard.  We’ve tried several ways to generate those customers, such as paid acquisition and CPC campaigns. The results haven’t been great, but it’s something we continue to refine and test to find the best method of outreach.  While I’m definitely at home writing code, the marketing side has been a challenge for me. My strong dyslexia makes writing content challenging, but we’ve found some great external partners to help us with this, and it’s something I don’t have to worry so much about.  ",1,0
185," Software Ideas is the overnight success story right now, but it comes from a lot of mistakes in the past. I’ve talked about CoderNotes.io, but I also have owned and operated a (failed) residential cleaning company, a (failed) textbook reselling business, and a (failed) auction-based reselling business. No one hits it out of the park on their first try. To quote Ben Orenstein from Tuple, “Start your first three businesses as quickly as possible.” ‍",1,0
186," Marketing turned out to be a huge issue. We didn’t know the gambling industry, and they didn’t know the DFS model, so affiliates and partners were trying to charge the commissions that they’d charge other gambling firms. We’re talking at least £60 CPA, but the biggest guys wanted over £200. Given that we were projected an LTV of around £50, it obviously didn’t work for us. As mentioned before, Investment was a problem. I had relationships with some big funds from before, but they all had money from investors who wouldn’t touch gambling.  Team resource was a problem as well. Although we didn’t have the money to hire, I didn’t have that much time for the project while working a full-time job. Pitching to investors, and trying to run all the marketing in just a couple of hours a day is really difficult when you’re desperate to grow as quickly as possible. I wouldn’t put direct competition down as a big issue though. There were some guys who had been around a year or so longer, had backing, had the experience. But we didn’t have high opinions of them, and their platforms were definitely inferior. It was still just a brand new idea in the UK really, no one was looking for you, so you had to work hard to put your brand out in front of people. Other mistakes...we probably tried a couple of channels that I should have known wouldn’t work. We got an ad in a digital magazine for university students and it drove nothing. The audience was probably right, I just doubt the quality of the magazine itself really (and having worked in the magazine industry, I should have known better.) If I could pick out one main thing that we could have done better, it would be a focus. My co-founder should have dealt with 90% of the investment stuff, while I attended London meetings when necessary, and I should have just focused my time on marketing and bumping our numbers up as quickly as possible.

187," The single biggest challenge was just being able to believe that everything would work out even when things were getting tough. There were points where I did not think the Kickstarter would ever fund, and took a step back for a few days to clear my mind and gain some motivation again. There were other frustrating times when manufacturing wasn’t going well, or a customer had a complaint. During all of these troubled times, though, I just knew in the back of my head it would work out. I could take these failures and issues and learn from them, and if I got through it the first time I would never make it happen again. Another challenge I have faced when starting and building Spuds is the number of decisions you have to make and things you have to learn. I have been fortunate to surround myself with people within the garment/apparel industry that are very experienced as it has helped me to learn and take their advice when needing to make manufacturing and design decisions. When it has come to all of the other aspects of growing a business, such as SEO, marketing, social media, media, etc, it has been very difficult being able to constantly improve in many aspects while trying to keep the business as lean as possible. With such a limited fund I have made it a priority to learn each department needed to help start and build this business, and it is a daily struggle trying to prioritize what to learn and what areas to apply that knowledge to. I have helped simplify this over time by prioritizing different parts of the day to different projects and tasks of each department, to make sure that I don’t start jumping around and can actually focus and learn in one area at a time. Lastly, the biggest personal challenge I have faced is dealing with anxiety and mood swings, to say the least. When it comes to the entrepreneurial journey, I believe that your mental health is one of if not the most important aspect. You are constantly dealing with daily success to failure swings, as well as that constant uncertainty of whether what you are working on will actually work or not. Having a support group, both from friends, family, and professionally, is extremely important during this time and making sure your mental health does not interfere with your work is good for both yourself and those around you. ‍  I would say that the single biggest mistake that we committed was being too confident with our first production. There were a lot of rookie mistakes that we didn’t take into account that hurt us overall, but we were able to stay on top without complete failure by keeping our initial customers constantly updated so they never felt out of the loop. The biggest production mistakes we made were: - Underestimating how much time it would take: Our initial promise for our Kickstarter backers was to have all product delivered starting in October. This was based off initial estimates we got from all our suppliers during other parts of the year, but did not realize that this time frame when a lot of other companies are wanting to create their own product in time for the holiday season. The production of our fabric and the final creation of the DIA Short were both longer than expected. We kept all of our backers in the loop, giving them weekly updates and a lifetime discount for all of the troubles. - Under-ordering material: We ended up not ordering enough material and the yield from production was lower than expected. This caused production to be short on a few color and sizing combinations for orders that were already placed. To fix this, I reached out to these customers randomly and offered them a refund, color change, or to wait until the next production. It worked out okay in the end, and everyone chose the option that they were most happy with.",1,0
188," Something we have historically been challenged with is setting expectations when we're going to miss deadlines. It’s really stressful to promise something and then have it hanging over your head. So I really try to avoid that in our business by not promising something that's not already done or almost done. Another challenge we’ve faced is that this is neither my nor Amy’s only business, which means that, sometimes, other things take priority. Finally, Amy’s health issues have also been really challenging. She has a serious chronic health issue that has become worse over the years. There are periods of time in which she can’t work. This is even more complicated due to the fact that Amy is mostly the face of Stacking the Bricks. Most people don’t know about me until they join 30x500. People, for example, would write for Amy, I’d reply and they would be like “Oh, who’s Alex?”. ‍",1,0
189," Everything takes time, especially in SaaS. So, we learned valuable lessons. Some of the most insightful lessons came while we were building our MVP: We did tons of interviews. We spoke about customer pain points, workflows and listened to their feature requests. Interviews helped us to see a bigger picture. However, we were surprised that they didn't help us with new features. To move forward, we needed the data on how our SaaS MVP was used and by whom. We didn't have internal statistics at first. It was like flying without radar. I can't imagine how we could work without it. Instead of shipping additional features, we should have built it from the start. We found that having only one tech person on a project may lead to coder's block. One person can get stuck, while several people have a better chance of finding a solution. Therefore, having one developer on the team may come at a higher cost than two.  At the beginning of 2017, we had a beta that was serving about 200 teams. However, it was far from being perfect with regard to features and stability. So we decided to re-write the bot entirely to deliver additional features our users were asking for. Instead of 1.5 months, it took us 4 months. Oops. After the release, the feature of adding answers didn't become popular. This is how we learned that additional features are not that important compared to core features. No matter how many nice tiny things you build, a product's success is about the core features people buy into. Speaking of disadvantages, it’s the fact that not everyone uses Slack. It will be better for them, because Slack increases team productivity and for us so that we could have a larger market.  ‍",1,0
190," One of our biggest obstacles in the early days was technical. We built Station on a technical stack (Electron) that proved great to build an MVP but challenging to scale and iterate on. Choosing the wrong platform is one of the 18 mistakes that kill startups listed by Paul Graham. We’ve learned it the hard way. It’s hard to know how good a platform is unless you know what you want to do with it (and when you start a company, it’s all in the open), but it’s worth taking the time to make sure you are choosing the right one. You wouldn’t build your 3-storey house on flimsy wooden foundations. The same thing applies here.  Also, building an extension (vs. a browser before) has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that an extension is easier to install for the user, faster to onboard onto hence it’s easier to get the buy-in from an entire team for instance. It doesn’t require a user to profoundly change their habit the way adopting a new browser does. On the other hand, that’s the catch, it’s also very easy to forget that an extension exists. To give you an example, you can use Station in the browser in two ways: hit CMD+E (on Mac) or simply open a new tab. For a while, we didn’t want to go into the new tab because we were afraid it would disrupt the user’s workflow. Nowadays 75% of activity in Station happens in the new tab. Without it, we’d have ¼ of the activity we have today. It’s crazy. With an extension, the stakes to get a user’s attention are higher so you must design your product with this brutal reality in mind. It’s a tricky balance to find between reminding the user your product is here while not disrupting their flow.  Finally, a big mistake we made in terms of marketing and communication happened during our pivot last year. We were really afraid of losing all our active users (but when you pivot that’s ultimately what is likely to happen). We communicated our pivot trying to convince them that we had done this for them and that the new product would fit their workflow. This generated a lot of backlash as many users felt like we had not heard them at all (what they wanted was a chat aggregator, not go back to the browser!). We’ve edited our communication after that episode and didn’t try so hard to convince our users that it was the right solution for them. If you pivot to build something fairly different from what you did before, chances are you’ll disappoint some people. That’s ok, just don’t lie to yourself about it.  ",1,0
191," Like so many brands, Stone was born from one idea and a couple of beers. But I think sometimes people forget the amount of time and energy it takes to see an idea through.  So for me, even holding our initial design felt like an achievement.  But we work with quite a specific set of materials so we’ve faced setbacks with sourcing, labor and production costs. But seeing the response of those in the industry towards our products has always reassured me of just how big Stone can become.  On a personal note, I faced the challenges of fulfilling one of the most successful food crowdfunders in history and becoming a dad within a few months of each other (not sure which one was more stressful). Shipping over 4,000 bespoke orders across the world was hell at times. But, and it may sound corny, my kid Beni is one of the reasons why I’m committed to making Stone a success. I just want to show him that if you have an idea and you’re passionate about it, nothing should stop you from making it a reality. ‍  Perhaps that I can be grumpy. If you feel passionate about something you get these waves of enthusiasm and energy. I try and utilize that as much as possible. But it's hard to maintain that. Better people than I can keep those levels stable but my mood can drop at times. I hear that's not uncommon though. The main thing is to be aware of it and manage it.  From a market perspective, we’ve already seen a few competitors, let’s say, ‘borrow’ ideas from the Stone range. We are still a small company so, particularly with our stationery collection, we need to stay one step ahead of big manufacturers like Moleskine. That’s one of the reasons why we’re expanding the range, to make Stone a multi-faceted lifestyle brand with its own unique appeal.  And yes we’ve made mistakes along the way. I could mention collaborations that didn’t work out or wholesale deals that weren’t financially viable but, as I said, I really do think that failures are the most valuable thing. As long as you establish why they weren’t useful, they’re incredibly useful.  ‍",1,0
192," Keep things simple. When I’ve tried to get too fancy, take on more than I could, or build too much complexity into the business then I’ve always failed. My most notable mistake was attempting to create software that would create a custom training plan. I hired a firm to do this, they dragged their feet, and I wasted $10k on a product they never delivered. The real lesson is to know what your business needs to thrive and focus on that - not shiny new things that seem great only in the abstract.  ",1,0
193," The technology stuff, aligning the team and finding really good people have been the main 3 challenges. The coaches are the most important people in Stronger U so hiring correctly and knowing who's going to be an awesome coach that aligns well with our values and what we’re trying to do as a business, is hard. We don't have any recruiters but we have built a network of friends that generally recommend coaches. I also meet some coaches at conferences. Even some clients experienced in nutrition have become coaches and we have trained them. Some of them become full time, some others part-time.  ‍  I think funding has been a disadvantage in comparison to our competitors. We are 100% debt-free, and everything has come out of our pocket. There are some other businesses in the industry that have received millions of dollars in funding and can grow much more quickly and efficiently.  Another disadvantage is the nutrition market. It's really hard to build trust. Many people have been misled and lied to so many times with other diets that it makes it hard to convince them that our system works. Stronger U offers something quite simple and it almost intimidates people because they don't think good nutrition can be this easy. This is also related to the word of mouth strategy we have mainly used, why we value our members so much, and why we put customer service over anything else. ‍",1,0
194," Balancing being aggressive with growth with the financial limitations of being self-funded. There’s a lot of infrastructure and team building to do to build this team right and instead of all at once you need to do it piece by piece, given the limitations, so then the decisions become what are the best pieces to build upon and when.  Building on that, most of the biggest obstacles have stemmed from people management and building great teams. It’s the hardest part of any business. Aside from that, trying to make great technical architecture decisions early on and not accumulate too much tech and process debt is also something to stay focused on. This also ties to data integrity and prioritizing that early. Without good data, it makes it hard to make good decisions and build strong processes.  We’ve got many strengths and are in a very fortunate spot. We don’t have the funding others have, but that’s by choice and also affords us the flexibility to make autonomous decisions and not chase short-term growth at the expense of long-term prosperity. We don’t have connections in the industry with the vendors and supply chain and maybe the credibility that other legacy distributors do, but we make up for that with creativity and a fresh approach to a stale industry, which has helped us build up credibility quickly as a company to pay attention to.  ",1,0
195," Initially, we thought we could easily develop this new product. At that point, we had grown our team to 10 people and had raised more funds from investors. We had also attracted the attention of a prominent entrepreneur and investor from the Valley, to whom I will simply refer as Mister Big. Mister Big was crazy about Swipes and he saw big potential for the app. So he started talking about investing $1M. $1 million US dollars for a team of 25 years-old co-founders who had started 2 years ago... Our ambitions and expectations grew exponentially and our vision blurred. But as you might have sensed, the investment did not go through. We were “infected” with the megalomaniac mentality of the Valley, however. We wanted to build this new collaboration tool that would solve the work of teams in the same elegant manner as the Swipes Personal task list app. But we were running out of runway, and the sensible business decision was to fire everybody, use the funds we had to get to product-market fit and build a profitable business. ‍ The three of us cared obsessively about the work we had done and the people we had been working with. Over the previous year, we had been creating a fantastic team culture and firing seemed like we would backstab our friends. But this was businesses and we eventually had to fire half the team. You have to understand one thing about us as a team. We were obsessed with creating a simple quality experience that delights people. One of our blessings that ended up turning into a disadvantage was our perfectionism and strive for quality. We have spent weeks perfecting a product we had then release on the market just to realize we need to get back to the drawing board. Our biggest misunderstanding was that people loved our initial product because it was delightful to use. Yes, that had a huge part in their experience, but most importantly it was serving them a need in a novel way. Swipes Personal gave our users a superpower to charge through their tasks like a champ and no matter the day to feel a sense of accomplishment. While the rest of the task list apps were focusing on getting organized, our focus was on achieving results, and that resonated with people. With our team product, called The Workspace, we had many novel ideas and daring tested daring designs, but we never succeeded in cracking the value of the problem. ‍  In 2016 Kasper and Yana moved to California. They were in the process of securing a $1M investment, but the relationship with the investor went sour and the deal was off the table. Soon after, I and the rest of the team followed them. At first, it was a new thrilling opportunity. We had been accepted into Alchemist one of the top B2B accelerators. There was a multitude of mentors, investors, and talent that we were meeting all the time. But as exciting the Bay Area was, it wasn’t our place. We met a handful of incredible people who helped immensely with their mentorship (hey Michael Moon), but there were a lot of phony people. Too many for my taste. The Valley was trying to mold us into something we didn’t relate to. What do I mean by that? The whole crush it, hustle, fake it until you make it, go big or die trying mentality just wasn’t us. As a result, we were facing many rejections from investors, partners, and customers. But it was a blessing to understand who we really are and what we stand for. We were 5 people living in a 2-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of Palo Alto, on the other side of Arrastradero Road. Our window was literally overlooking at the cemetery where Steve Jobs was rested to peace. I started to feel resentful towards the place and life in general. And it wasn’t helping the fact that I was a thousand miles away from my girlfriend at the time.  But as difficult as it was, it was a moment I wouldn’t change. During this period, we learned as a team to be truthful about who we were and what we stood for. We eventually returned to Europe, a bit wiser and very exhausted. It was 2017 and we still didn’t have a product-market fit nor a working business. But like the stubborn people we are, we kept on pushing. To extend our runway we raised capital from few American and Bulgarian angel investors among whom Bogomil Balkansky and Vassil Terziev. We doubled down our efforts and released another major rework of the team product. In the product release video, we used our dire situation to form a plot around. There was interest, but not enough, so we continued. Through 2018 and until the end of 2019 we kept reworking and releasing. We eventually ceased to look for investment money and focused solely on doing design and development projects for clients. We ground ourselves to exhaustion. The company we were trying to create was feeding on our physical and mental health. One by one, we were burning out. So eventually in June 2019, we decided no more. It was a difficult decision, a very emotional decision. But it was either the company or our health at the line. We chose the latter. And this is how this chapter of our story ends.",0,0
196," When we first launched Swoop marketplace we were able to get by with basic tech and a lot of manual input simply because we didn’t have a tidal wave of incoming requests and our team was very dedicated to conquer any swell. But, whenever you’re launching a product in the tech industry you need to have great engineers to develop it for you, otherwise you’ll get left in the dust. Finding the right engineers who were willing to get scrappy while also compensating them fairly was difficult. The rest of the team ran off equity packages and a very minimal salary while doing most of the heavy lifting. We simply couldn’t afford to bring anyone on board to develop what would ultimately increase our profitability. Pretty much the pickle every startup finds itself in. I spent countless hours increasing my coding knowledge while the rest of the team kept Swoop afloat. Knowing how precious time was, I begged my long time friend, Ruben, to leave his job at Facebook and lead the fundraising efforts at Swoop. Thankfully Ruben said yes. He wanted to carve out his own destiny at a startup and wanted to walk the tightrope with us. After a few months of minimal sleep and daily hot-flashes, I got the call. We secured our pre-seed funding and we were able to bring on our core team with a full-time salary along with adding two engineers.  I personally find my greatest disadvantage in managing my time on specific tasks. Being able to prioritize projects in the correct order can give you a huge upper hand, especially in app development. Our initial web app took over 1 year to develop because we were compartmentalizing our time inefficiently. In a way, recognizing this weakness has taught me patience and also helps with attachment issues. There were times the team and I invested countless hours into a project and then suddenly had to scrap it and start all over again because it didn't make sense for the new direction of Swoop. There were also moments we moved on from a task that needed a little more nurturing and this led to some tedious backpedaling. Having gone through these experiences multiple times has brought me a ton of perspective while building Swoop and has actually brought the team closer.  ",1,0
197," One of our worst mistakes was experimenting with a new growth strategy without being prepared for the byproducts. We were testing TikTok as a possible acquisition channel. A TikTok creator from Mexico found our extension from one of our paid TikTok collaborations and created a viral video in LatAm, where Spanish is the primary language. But at the time, our chrome extension didn't support Spanish. So we had an enormous spike in new sign-ups, which created a tidal wave of support tickets from frustrated users who couldn't use Tactiq to transcribe their Google Meets in Spanish.  It was an “ahhhh” moment - we needed to test for these types of unexpected outcomes in controlled ways. We had not anticipated Spanish users from our TikTok experiment until then, as our sponsored videos were solely in English. We weren’t ready for that new sign-up volume. There were a few weeks of frantically responding to an onslaught of Intercom support tickets, all in Spanish, toggling between Intercom and Google Translate. We weren't prepared for that unforeseeable outcome that created enormous user churn and resource drain for our team. ",1,0
198," My main mistake was not doing enough research and validating the idea of the product. I spent 90% of my time building the product and 10% on marketing. And even the product wasn’t that well built. I still had a lot to learn. I hadn’t learned much about marketing from Anyemail Finder as it was a cool product that people wanted it and they just kept coming back. But Tailor wasn’t a cool product and I was trying to connect with the wrong audience (small websites). Another mistake I committed was carrying out the 12 startups in 12 months challenge. I would recommend everyone who is considering this to create a product and stick with it to grow it. Also, there was a big disadvantage on the market that was the enormous players, which offered free options. Small websites would rather go with Optimziely. ‍",0,0
199," The biggest challenge was probably the MSFT Imagine Cup world finals... and it was tough. It all started in the first meeting - when I was introduced to a developer experience advocates at Microsoft Puerto Rico, who would eventually teach me the art of pitching, user design & experience, and handling the press. Also, we brought in a marketing specialist who taught me how to pitch my product with emotion and appeal to the hearts of the judges. During this intensive period of trial and error, that lasted about two months, I perfected my pitch and presentation to deliver to the judges. I also began getting much press attention for Taleship. This was one of the best learning experiences of my life, and I utilize all this knowledge on startups and pitching every day. The public speaking aspect has improved so much - I went from an introvert to confidently giving public speeches anywhere, anytime. After the two months, the deadline arrived, and Microsoft flew me to Seattle where I’d compete with 51 other teams around the world. After intense pitching sessions and demo showcases, I managed to make it to Quarterfinals, top 32 world - as a 17-year-old solo indie hacker. I would say that was the biggest challenge - the competition. What I did wrong? Well, in hindsight, I could’ve utilized the press attention much better. Mostly, they all fall down to marketing. ‍",0,0

We had never raised venture capital before, built a product from scratch, or tested sales and marketing techniques, along with a whole lot more.

202," Digital health is a tough space. We observed several other companies before us trying to tackle medication adherence, and if they started as direct-to-consumer, at some point they inevitably pivoted to prioritizing enterprise partnerships. Unfortunately, those same consumer challenges - adoption and retention - follow you into enterprise pilots as well, and when an enterprise isn't able to see meaningful utilization and efficacy with their target audience, it’s a struggle to win those deals too. We were enamored with designing and validating the right interventions to improve adherence, when the much larger existential question was whether consumers were even interested in the first place. We should have recognized upfront that finding strong acquisition channels was a necessary precondition for this whole project to work, and we should've done some early testing (e.g. some Google or FB ads with simple landing pages) to gauge the difficulty ahead. I believe we would have had a path to monetization if we figured out acquisition, but more generally, it's possible the area of medication adherence may be intractable, absent breakthrough technology, stronger incentives, and larger market shifts (e.g. doctors and the healthcare system prioritizing adherence). ‍",0,0
203," We got to a point where we had a nice balance in enough cities to bring in enough money. It was always a little bit difficult. We had a pricing model where teachers paid us a fee, once they've had four successful lessons. If a student dropped out before that we wouldn't charge the teacher. We'd only charge a one-off fee. We weren't taking a percentage of their earnings, which I think teachers liked, but we had to constantly get updates from teachers. As that scaled, it became a labor-intensive process of chasing up teachers, getting updates, sending them invoices, getting payments. It was difficult to automate that. ‍",0,0

I didn’t feel good asking for their time after work, when they were going to their families after another stressful day at work.

206," It is always really, really fun when your entire program breaks, your entire system just decides to take a nap. Luckily, this has happened only one time. As soon as this happened, I sent out a mass email to all of my customers apologizing for the inconvenience and I let them know that we were diligently working to fix the issue. I was panicking and I started to go into one of those spiraling thought modes. I said things to myself like, “What if the program never comes back up?” “What if everyone leaves me bad reviews?” What if, what if, what if? I try not to listen to the “what-ifs” because they are not very helpful. Side note: One of my favorite writers is Shel Silverstein, and he wrote a poem about the “What-ifs” that live inside people’s heads. Highly recommend.  As far as competitors go in this industry, there are a few different platforms that offer social media posts and print marketing for real estate agents. One of the biggest obstacles we have faced as a company was trying to be different from the other companies, and my worst mistake was comparing myself too much to these other companies. A lot of times I would get down on myself and want to quit because I kept on telling myself, “I am never going to be as successful as them!” This is not a good way of thinking. I had to push more of that negative talk behind me and start focusing on what I could do to be a little bit different. In May we decided to White-label with another company, and that company made it possible for our customers to post directly onto their social media from The Agent Nest. This was a game-changer! We are the only company in this industry that offers this in the platform itself, and that is how we figured out how to be different from our competitors. We were also able to add another plan, and if someone wants to get access to that scheduling feature the cost is $59/month as opposed to the $32/month for the basic access to our site. I am so glad that we did this! One other issue I ran into was not budgeting correctly. I am the kind of person who thinks one should spend a lot of money on marketing, and we spend around $1,500/month on Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest Ads. There was a month where I was not paying attention. I usually create multiple Facebook ads at once and give them the same daily budget, and after about three days I go and see which ad is performing the best and cancel the ones that are not performing. Well… one time I forgot to do that, and I had to pay $1,000 for an ad that was not delivering and not working. That was rough! Now I pay more attention! ‍",1,1

208," The main hurdle we faced in the early days was ensuring we had the proper paperwork. Our industry is heavily regulated. We were audited seven different times by different government agencies. That’s probably a good thing for consumers, but can be frustrating for business owners. It was a very bureaucratic process. We overcame this challenge by hiring a consultant who helped us apply for the required licenses.  We believe in value. People love great value for money. Better services are hard to quantify and hard to justify. People always expect a good result from your services. Our experience is that people expect to pay for baseline acceptability. Anything above this they do not want to pay for. They would rather spend their money on something else. So I always design service delivery to execute with optimum value. Charging extra money for a premium service is quite hard to justify. It took us a while to realize this. I think that has been one of our biggest mistakes so far. But now we have our pricing strategy and USPs optimized. ",1,0
209," We started with a very low capital ($75,000AUD). This meant that our start was slow and we really had to prove ourselves in the early portion of the Cave’s existence. Another challenge we had was defining ourselves. We had a little of everything, which meant some people were confused as to what we were actually doing. This was generally overcome once they stepped through the door and experienced it for themselves, but we definitely should have had a stronger identity to really breakthrough.",0,0
210," The major challenge was to create acceptability for our product at the price point. We could have overcome this challenge if we had the financial capability to run a campaign to educate the customer about the differentiated product. The market is really price elastic, especially for the kind of cuisine we were offering. We could not have been successful at the price point at which we were playing without making some kind of changes either by on products, packaging or elsewhere in the value chain.",0,0
211," It’s hard to think of mistakes of a product that was never launched and was shut down at the early stage of development. As I’ve never monetized my products before, I think my main marketing mistakes were ahead, never actually destined to happen. The main challenge was making my product not generic, a point where it would be impossible to compete with other mature products that had more functionalities because of the years spent building them, better marketing budgets, and experts.  I think my main mistake was realizing that I was unable to continue but still deciding to proceed. It cost me two years but as I have a habit of celebrating my mistakes and turning them into advantages, I learned a lot and it all made a great story. ‍",0,0
212," Deciding to leave the life I’ve built in San Francisco to start Trackin was already a big step. I am an entrepreneur and wanted to get back to that life, but this time it meant giving up on a visa, job, life, friends, cheap place etc. Then getting back to France, it was hard for people to understand my ambitions, I kept hearing that I should start “slowly and not aim too high and slow down on international expansion” Follow your guts when you hear people telling you that it’s not the right thing to do and how to approach things is tough, because some people will be right about some aspects of your business, but some people will be wrong...so how do you know which one to listen to? Deciding to keep working on this adventure alone was another big challenge, and it has been since then. Getting into YC, talking to investors, managing your company...you are expected to do as well as other companies, even though you’re alone. I’ll always remember Michael Seibel during the program explaining to the batch how solo founders are supposed to be “superheroes” because expectations are at least the same and nobody will help out. Although I feel very fortunate, because looking back, I have learned so much about everything related to creating and growing a business: management, sales, hiring, marketing, accounting, technology, customer support, scalability, fundraising etc. There are days I wish I had more time to be a normal CEO, but overall, it’s a huge chance to be able to lead a growing company by yourself, because the amount of new skills you get is extremely valuable and will help you not only in your business life but also in your personal life. Everything becomes so easy! The last biggest challenge I had to face was being in the food space. We came late in the game and humans are not really objectives...After some bad investments were made, and after some companies failed, (mainly because of lack of business models and leadership), food suddenly became a ‘bad’ market. Which forced me to build a business sustainable and profitable right away instead of taking the VC shortcut. But at the end of the day, it made us stronger and we have solid foundations to scale! ‍  I’ve made huge hiring mistakes, multiple times, always ended well though, because I don’t think like you win anything by fighting with people for your ego. And I kept people for too long in the team when I knew they weren’t performing. ‍ We also made mistakes regarding our first targets with Trackin: we wanted to build the product for chains, but started talking to small businesses, so developed features based on their feedback, then realized chains were making more sense as target, but needed different features and had longer sales cycles. After trying to sell to chains and talking to experimented investors, I realized that to build a solid business I should sell to small businesses. A lot of them. Chains would ask for custom features and would take tons of time to make decisions, payments etc. Plus, they would represent a high percentage of your revenue and losing one of them could be meaning laying of people. Another mistake I’ve made was spending too much time to get money from government, loans, and contests. This is honestly all bullshit. It’s not because you’re winning contests that customers will show up, love your product and pay you. Contests are only good to have press articles and to get some credibility but it’s not a long-term strategy. This is still a common mistake made by entrepreneurs. The money helped me start hiring people, but the paperwork needed for it and still needed today wasn’t worth it. Keeping people too long in your team when you know they are creating problems or not performing the way you want is also a big mistake. I’ve tried to help and change too many people, at some point you can’t help everybody and need to hire people that will bring great things since day 1, especially in a startup. Then in a big corporation, you can do the opposite. Last but not least, as a co-founder of a company before Trackin, I’ve built the product with my engineers and my CEO without actually talking to the market. We thought we knew what people wanted when we actually didn’t. We spent almost a year building a product that didn’t make any sense to the market we targeted and closed almost as soon after we “launched”. ‍",1,0
213," Being a woman and the founder of a growth marketing agency has been pretty bumpy. I’ve been really lucky to have supportive partners and mentors but it can also be lonely and isolating. You learn to get really good at being outside your comfort zone almost 100% of the time.  One of the biggest challenges at Tuff has been building a fully remote team. This is a huge focus for us and I’ve had to systematically change the way I think about team culture and team building to get us to a place where we’re humming as a team, share values, and people are excited to log in to Slack in the AM.  Like any other startup, we’ve made a lot of mistakes, and continue to make mistakes and learn from those.  I think the biggest thing for me has been not acting quickly enough when we’ve made a mistake with hiring when there has been misalignment around the culture we’re building. One of our values at Tuff is creating a work environment where people can make mistakes, have ownership, grow, and learn. To make this possible, we have a clearly defined career framework so people know specifically how they can grow and develop in their role. This has been especially helpful as a small team because not everyone is going to (or wants to) grow into managing.  But, it took us two years to build. If I could go back a year or so, I would put more resources and time into building a career framework early that defined team roles, salaries, and career paths.  ",1,1
214," It’s just always a challenge. We’re in a competitive space, and we strive to be the very best Twitter tool. So we’re constantly in a state where we’re working on a new killer feature, adding value to the product. It’s tough, but we have gotten the hang of it. It used to be that we were very good at inspiration and less good at other things like scheduling or automation. But I think we caught up nicely. Also, we weren’t ready for all the growth we had. Fun story (or not): a couple of times, we hit the daily quota of tweets we were allowed to post every day, which meant some scheduled tweets weren’t being published. Fortunately, we were able to sort things out with the team at Twitter, and we now have plenty of room for growth. Coming back to a personal level, I’ve had to deal with a couple of pretty hard things in my life in the past few months. Having Tweet Hunter go well during those tough times was a blessing. I can’t imagine what it would have been like if things weren’t going well professionally.  As a team, I think we’re very creative and love everything that’s shiny and new. It’s cool when you’re trying to figure out what to work on, but it turns into a disadvantage when you have something that works and you have to double down on your focus and start doing the same things multiple times. In other words, we get bored. In terms of product, we pack a LOT of features. Of course, this is great, but it also means we need to invest more into onboarding, help center, explanations, etc. We started with a minimal set of features and had 0 support and no help articles. Now we need to gear up. Not everyone is used to using SaaS tools and we need to take that into account. As for mistakes we made, well, there’s a ton. We have the luxury of making decent revenue, so sometimes we don’t spend on the right things. There are a few marketing efforts we invested in that didn’t pay off (yet). ‍",1,0
215," There is one thing I can not get over for many years. This is a dead simple, obvious and quite a popular problem: I work too much. When I work a lot, I can finish many things. This sounds fine in theory, but in reality it is not true. It turned out that the less I work the better my results and the longer run I can go. Let 's see why. First, working too much makes me feel low energy and in the end - burn out. Gosh, I burn out 2 times a year!  Burning out means I can not do any other job that is responding in the support chat. No strategy planning, no hiring, no creative posts, no product improvements, no updates, no new connections. Each burnout removes 20-25 productive days of my life.  Now we will do some simple math. Imagine, I work 10 hours a day instead of 8.  Ur-r-rrgh, I can go even more hardcore! Let’s add an extra working day - Saturday.  It will add 104 additional working days per year. Yay! I can do more coding, more design, more this and that. This is just a-w-e-s-o-m-e, isn't it? 😁 But this lifestyle will end in 50 wasted days during the burnouts and restoring. Besides, each hardcore 10 hours day ends with falling down in the bed with zero energy in the batteries. It means I can not spend quality time with the family. Also, I can not contribute to my hobbies which make my life brighter and eventually help to be more productive, focused and creative at work by giving me a mind relax.  So I try to follow this simple rule: work as little as possible. Here are some tips that help: I leave the laptop at the workspace. If there is something urgent, I can use my spouse's laptop (there were 0 urgent accidents since 2018).Tick-tack. It is 7 p.m. You stand up and go out of the work space. Just shut down the Mac and go away. No questions asked. Just do it.2 vacations per year. Unfortunately, I can not afford a vacation at this moment. But this is something I want to bring back to my life.Weekends were invented to have a rest. So rest! ‍",1,0

217," We tried a lot but never really saw the traction. Of course, we managed to get in a few new students, but we couldn't find a scaleable marketing channel. It was frustrating because our pre-order did well. Most of the students that converted on the pre-order where Robin's loyal customers from years ago (so that was a bit of a ""red flag""). We knew that we needed to build stronger relationships with artists and change their beliefs about investing in online courses if we wanted to be truly successful. In the summer of 2018, Robin and I were out for dinner and we talked about the state of Zero to Radio Ready and how to continue (don't worry, he was laughing about the size of the chicken on my plate). We were frustrated and we both thought it was time for a pivot.  Before launching Zero to Radio Ready, we should've conducted more interviews with customers and prospects. This would've helped us in tremendously with positioning and copywriting. Another mistake is that we didn't give Zero to Radio Ready all we got in terms of marketing. We could've pushed it further, and maybe traction was around the corner. But as months passed, we were less and less motivated. My own mistake is probably buying a tool we didn't need. It cost us around $800 but we ended up not using it and used a free product instead that did the job much better (if you read this Robin, I'm sorry). ‍",1,0
218," Started servicing broad-industry instead of a niche first. Don’t do that — too much competition, and very hard to differentiate unless you have top, top brand expertise. We were OK and could design relatively well, but even that isn’t enough when you're against much larger incumbents.  This isn’t the same as not being horizontally ambitious. You can be that, but you should focus first, get product-market fit, and then repeat with another adjacent market or product. The disadvantage we had was zero relationships with agencies, which feed production companies' work. We weren’t in a position to make the agencies change suppliers, so we had to go direct. Paid ads are hard to get right for B2B that doesn’t offer a self-serve product like SaaS it cost us a fair bit in experimentation. ‍",1,0
219," Viewst is my second venture and wherever possible I’ve applied my knowledge and experience and thereby avoided some basic operational mistakes. But somehow it still doesn’t get easier! For me, the most difficult aspect is creating the optimal working environment and ensuring that communication is transparent and clear. We faced the new reality of total isolation after just four months of working on Viewst, and the team hadn’t had enough time rehearsing together to perform like a harmonious orchestra. Subtleties were missed, which affected our productivity and resulted in some operational mistakes. Within our team we lacked sufficient expertise to bring the product to the market, build a community of users, and structure and analyze the data. I had to learn a lot in a very short space of time and as a result, made mistakes and was angry with myself and the team. I never communicated my frustrations. In retrospect, I think it set us back several months, and time and again communication issues and transparency are sources of problems. I hired a professional coach and a therapist to help me to overcome my limitations and to improve my interactions with the team. I’m happy to say that this has had a very positive effect – and I believe the team would say the same thing!  ",1,1
220," The biggest challenge has been that my cofounder and I have very different personalities, working styles, and preferences. We clashed at first after the honeymoon stage was over, but once we were able to get over this, our differences became a considerable advantage. His strengths were my weaknesses and vice versa. Different preferences meant we debated rigorously about every decision. Once we learned to disagree well, we started moving fast and executing better. We could also delegate much better because tasks became something one of us was better at or preferred to do. Other than coaching, one thing that helped a lot was that we promised each other the day we incorporated that we would be friends when it was over no matter what happened.  ",1,0
221," The biggest obstacle was convincing my wife that after one year into it, we should double-down and pursue this startup more aggressively. We had plans to move from a big city to a tiny town in Bariloche as our 7yr old was starting 1st grade and it was an opportunity to start fresh. But she thought it would be more opportune time to take a long pause on the project and recover from our past startup deficits, as the first year was quite time-consuming and I had to sacrifice a lot of my family time. I had to convince her that pausing our momentum = Death. That the momentum we gained from our past year to build was our only asset today to leverage, and that we had to double down on our focus and see where we would net out one year later. Perhaps If I didn't have a co-founder, I could have been open to making that choice, but I also felt compelled to keep my commitment to him as well and follow-through on phase 2 of our product roadmap.I’m really glad I listened to my instinct. 1 year later we doubled our ARR. ‍  Probably not putting enough early focus on content marketing and SEO. But as we had very little resources starting, I felt more compelled to double down on product quality and let that speak for itself. I've also been told by a close advisor that I should have stopped building more features, and switched to 1:1 sales much earlier. About 6-months earlier. But my gut told me to stay on the product as it felt more compelling at the time.  Making the switch is not for the faint of heart as it is so time-consuming and you inevitably lose product-focus. I just felt I couldn't start selling until it was beyond just OK, because for me when you do sales you kind of just have 1 shot in making your first impression, and our target is other high-caliber end-users who were used to seeing mature products..so it felt useless wasting their time until I could knock them out of their seats. ‍",1,0

223," We grew too fast I’m not sure how you get over this one really. To this day I still feel we were let down by the UK financial sector. We were growing so fast and we just couldn’t get any more from the banks and the investment sector seemed adamant that if it wasn’t a tech business they weren't investing.  One thing I do keep going back to is that we maybe should have pitched the business more as a tech business with clothing manufacturing behind it rather than a clothing brand using a website. It was very ahead of its time so maybe I got my pitch wrong.  Also, we took on a salesperson way too soon. I wanted to grow before we should have and thought we’d catch up on the revenue and profits needed by bringing them on board. We’d worked with an outsourced company for a year before this to process smaller orders and bringing a salesperson in quadrupled the cost of processing sales.  ",0,0
224," In terms of challenges, I wouldn’t be the first to say that after the initial joy of starting a project you get into a lot of details, which were covered for you, when you were an employee. It seems like a quick skill to get, but it takes time, patience and effort. It drags your attention await from building project and puts you in a very new and not so friendly territory of being your own boss and business owner. This is the time when you need your friends/family support and they don’t need to tell you what you do right or wrong, all you need is a warming “You will handle this”. Do not underestimate how much you don’t know about running a business, do your homework and read about company types, taxes and what’s required to actually run the business. It the skill that will be paid off for sure and you won’t make it in 2 weeks like I thought it would be.",0,0
225," The biggest mistake was to build an application that matched the UK market very well, and other markets not at all. Despite the fact that we had great sales and a great product, we quickly found the UK market was smaller than we expected and that our application was not as useful abroad. This meant our international expansion was a failure. But that’s not all. When we tried to sell the business, a SaaS product with about $20k MRR, and a churn of effectively 0%, we found no buyers. The reason was that American entrepreneurs didn’t want to buy a foreign business and there aren’t enough British entrepreneurs for the market of selling companies to be liquid enough. ",0,0
226," It’s funny, our biggest disadvantages have almost become some of our biggest advantages.  The disadvantages we started with were our price point, time, and our market. Podcasters generally don’t have much a budget for tools outside of their hosting platform (most podcasters don’t make any revenue). As a result, we had to set our price fairly low to start. We also didn’t have an audience and the podcast market is very fragmenting. This made getting started very slow.  When we started, I had just spent a year with no-pay trying to get our startup off the ground (which failed) and Nick had recently passed the bar (he is a lawyer) and decided to become a software engineer. I didn’t have much money left and Nick had a mountain of student debt. Becoming a lawyer isn’t cheap after all.  These two disadvantages made us build the business slowly while also freelancing on the side. We had to be patient and watch the business grow while constantly re-evaluating whether or not it would be a side project or could become a full time gig.    Our main disadvantages when we got started was a lack of experience and capital and a naivety around building products. We didn’t understand how to properly evaluate a market, do customer discovery, and make fast decisions while attempting to get the business off the ground.  We made a lot of mistakes along the way. Our biggest mistake before Wavve was relying on feature development to drive traction rather than use marketing & transaction to fill our funnel. We fell into the feature fallacy and thought the next big feature would set us on the right course.  We also commonly made the mistake of listening to the loud minority. Say 10 users come in the funnel: 4 would convert and one would be upset. We would listen to that one upset user and let them drive product development rather than listening to the happy 4 customers that paid.  One example of this was all the time we spent supporting social integrations for a small set of very vocal users that wanted to post to social directly from our app when the majority were fine downloading the mp4 video and uploading themselves.  I sometimes think we might have taken too long to pay ourselves. We were so desperate to get the business to a certain revenue point that we never were able to feel the effect of SaaS revenue in our own pockets. I would suggest founders to pay themselves something as soon as possible. ‍",1,0
227," Wow, there are so many… The hardest part was to find money each month in order to survive We had an angel investor but last year he decided to stop founding us and my job was to find money in order to keep Waydev alive. I did a lot of sacrifices. I moved with my parents and didn’t spend any cent on me for a long period of time. Hopefully, now we’re profitable and we have a very good growth rate. In terms of obstacles, the hardest part was to find valuable engineers with the same values as me, but this is part of any successful startup.   I don’t like to use the word “mistake” because in a startup everything is about keeping the startup alive until you succeed, and any “mistake” is part of the road: the road of keep going until you find a way of making money, because money is the best metric related to a startup success. You need to have a lot of things coming together in order to generate revenue. ",1,0
228," I’ve talked about it quite extensively in the previous question, but to summarize I’d point out the 3 biggest mistakes: ‍1. Failing to utilize off-the-shelf tools to get product-market-fit Knowing what I know now, we could have built 80% of WedMap with 20% of time-spent, simply using Wordpress Themes for marketplaces and a bit of custom coding, that our co-founder was more than capable to do. It would have saved us at least 6 months of time. 6 months...I’ll leave you with that thought.  2. Not talking to our customers and thinking we know what the market needs You heard this one 100s of times already. Why? Because it’s true. It takes a certain level of naivety and arrogance to THINK you know what your market needs. Please note that the majority of our market was the opposite sex. We all know that men can’t know what women need :) Jokes apart - it took us 1.5 years to really start talking to our customers. And even then, we were simply looking for affirmations to our ideas and ignored the red flags.  3. Not being ready for a marathon During the last 6-8 months of WedMap, we were exhausted from encountering problematic hiccups and reacting to them by desperately looking for quick-fixes, quick wins. We started to engage in multiple side-projects looking for any revenue streams. Our bank accounts were empty and arguments at home were more frequent - it’s an immense pressure to experience and I wish everyone to be in that place at least once. Our response to that situation was bad, because when starting WedMap, we had high expectations that everything would work out within the first 6-12 months. Ridiculous when I think about it now, but it only shows that we were not ready to look at WedMap as a marathon and not a sprint. That mentality led us to a series of really bad decisions.",0,0
229," Though our business was in a healthy state and we were growing, when Covid hit, we as founders had to take a call on our future. Though it was an unforeseen challenge, we took it positively. Our approach was to work with our core principles and business premise, yet transform to stay relevant and maintain our growth. This move has held us in good stead as we saw 600% growth in our user base in the next 18 months. The other challenge that I personally, as a women entrepreneur, faced was the unconscious bias around. There are skeptics everywhere - including family, friends, and even peers. Especially because I hail from a small town (Tier III in India), when I quit my job to start my own venture, no one agreed with my decision. It was considered too risky as I was expected to go the conventional route of holding on to a typical day job. However, with Woovly growing rapidly and setting new benchmarks, I am happy to note that young women find my journey inspirational to start their ventures.   While scaling up, we needed a lot of skilled resources and that’s where I think I fumbled. When the ask was to hire fast, I took a lot of time to hire new talent. When new hires did not perform, I waited too long to let them go, giving them multiple opportunities to come up the curve. In some ways, the slow learners and poor performers slowed down our growth. But very soon, it made me realize that it wasn’t the ideal way to grow. I learned to keep my emotions aside and take tough decisions when necessary.   Another disadvantage we faced was that we were in unchartered territory. Since social commerce as a concept is still in its early phase in India, we had no benchmarks or standards to measure against. There was nobody to share insights into the industry and we just experimented and built as we progressed.  ‍",1,1

231," I wouldn’t say there was a particular BIG mistake or mistakes. I think I had a lot of small things that added up and here I’ll list them. I went too fast and should have taken more time.Should have vetted producers and movie titles much better. Looking back, I spent 3-4 times more than I should have spent on licensing.I moved from New York to California. This was actually one of my biggest mistakes. I had a track record and a stable group of people and connection in NY that would have helped me grow even further. Moving to Los Angeles California, I knew no one and emotional that was bad. Also, California is not business friendly. I paid so much in fees and taxes that I swore to never go back there.I had no exit strategy. As someone who is extremely passionate about what they’re doing, this is the last advice I would give anyone. But having gone through my experience with WURA, I believe that if you’re going to build anything that will cost you north of $100,000, best to have an exit plan.

232," I sincerely believe that the biggest obstacle I had to overcome was to convince myself and my close friends and family that what I was doing was worthwhile and impactful.  At early stages, it feels like your startup is nothing more than wishful thinking and any person can easily poke holes in your business concept, and you are bombarded with a wide variety of advice on how you should take your startup forward. It can be pretty terrifying to keep going ahead against all odds.

234," On a personal level, I'm a non-technical founder. So it’s a challenge when it comes to building a software company. My co-founder and I had almost no leadership experience, so building ZenMaid was just figuring it out as we came. We also didn't have any reputation in the industry, with no audience. When we were cold emailing to get our first hundred customers, people weren’t responding, and our emails were going to spam because we just sounded like two random dudes from India asking them for money for software that didn’t exist yet. We had to hire a friend who had a bit more of a friendly name. In comparison to our competition, we had no funding, which was a significant obstacle to overcome.  We were also working remotely back in 2013 when we first started ZenMaid, although we were still in the same town. We'd see each other a couple of times a week to chat, which was also another challenge. The final obstacle that we've overcome was picking a very challenging market. Maid services tend to be late adopters. It took us a long time to get to $10,000 in monthly recurring revenue, which wouldn't even cover their living expenses for many founders. It took us over three years to go from zero to $10k in MRR, and then another four years to go from $10k to $100k MRR.  As for the biggest mistake that we've made in ZenMaid history, we spent over a year working on a redesign of the software and moving different things around both UI and UX changes, as well as releasing a couple of new features. We took that live and took down our system for almost three days in the middle of the week. It was in 2017 and ended up costing us between 30 and 35% of our MRR over the following six months. We were at $18k in monthly recurring revenue when we launched that redesign. And we essentially went back down to $12k. The new design was much better than the old one, but the transition was very painful. It was poor leadership on my part and then poor communication by multiple parties within the company. ",1,0
235," Our biggest challenge so far has been keeping up with the surge in demand due to COVID-19. While many businesses were downsizing or shutting down, we experienced the opposite. Almost overnight our web traffic and sales quadrupled. It’s a good problem to have, but not something we anticipated. We had to quickly hire additional team members and set up systems in place to make sure we have enough products stocked in our warehouse. The challenge we face now is projecting what our business looks like next year and beyond as the impact of the pandemic changes.  One of the mistakes we’ve made is our brand positioning. We were able to gain initial traction by focusing on the fitness industry. This was helpful in the early days of the company because we were able to carve out a niche. However, it also limited our growth opportunities. Because all of the messaging on our website discussed how our products could benefit gym and fitness studio owners, we missed out on opportunities to sell our products to other types of businesses such as airports, hotels, schools, and hospitals. We’re now fixing this mistake by revamping our brand positioning and adding new pages on our website to help attract more customers from industries outside of fitness. However, it’s a challenge to change how a brand is perceived once it has been established.  ",1,0

I mean, everything back then was new to me, I had no fucking idea what I was doing so everything was a challenge. Heck, even getting online at the time was a challenge. I know now I would be able to manage the business much better. Anyway, I would definitely don’t start again. It’s tough to decide to go back to when you were 16 years old and start over.
