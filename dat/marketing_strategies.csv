0," Our thought was to go B2P (Business to Professor). If we could get classes to use our tool, then we’d have new customers buying our game every semester. Thought was to partner and grow our relationships with professors and help build customized games for their classes. In practice, it was tough to get anyone interested and even tougher to customize class by class. --- How did you employ/approach these tactics? Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous? This whole endeavor taught me that you should talk to as many potential users as possible during the building process. It would have saved younger me a lot of time and headache knowing that the monetization funnel was going to fail before spending time building out assets and a custom game engine from scratch. Getting warm intros makes these users/potential sales meetings easier to get on friendlier terms. You get better feedback too. Leverage your immediate social network to help you out and learn as fast as possible!",0,0
1," As 10er was launched through and for my own podcast I already had a platform and target audience. Since then I’ve taken in other projects (136+ as of writing this). As my biggest obstacle is finding the time to work on 10er, I’ve kept my marketing efforts to only target projects, letting the projects themselves attract donors. I’ve tried some content marketing-ish blogging. Even hired a friend to interview projects, but in the end I think most (if not all) projects found 10er through some other project using the service. Podcasters usually listen to a lot of podcasts themselves. Lucky for me. I’ve recently opened up a lot more about the project, sharing my income and expenses on the site and saw a nice bit of interest from that. At this point, it seems to me that my most impactful way of marketing will be sharing as much as possible. Creative people are attracted to other people’s experiences and creative people are my target audience. ‍",1,0
2," So about two months later I’d finished the website and we were ready to go. I posted in on Product Hunt and it got an initial burst of traffic. But slowly and surely the traffic was drying up and we realized we needed to do something a bit different.  Thankfully my co-founder Giles had come up with an idea. He said we should post our canvases to YouTubers around the world who do this thing called “Mail Time”. Now, “Mail Time” is a type of video where YouTubers open fan mail and show it off to the camera. So we thought, this could be a wild way to get our startup some exposure. We found ten YouTubers who did regular Mail Time videos, wrote ten funny tweets, printed them off as A1 Canvases, and shipped them to their PO boxes around the world. A couple of weeks passed and a YouTuber called Chilly did a MailTime video and opened our canvas on camera. She was so impressed by our gift that she gave a free shoutout to our website in the description and even pinned my comment. This video ended up getting 3.3 million views. Next up, this Youtuber called Sodapoppin does a MailTime and opens our canvas. That video got 400k views. In terms of why it worked, I think it was all the little details we went to.  Whilst most companies sending products included formal letters and sleek packaging we did the complete opposite. We bought glitter, fancy cards, bubblewrap, Christmas wrapping paper, and hand wrote personal letters.  This certainly bought us goodwill with the YouTubers who were more than up for shouting out our product. In total, we spent £250 spent, 2 out of 10 hit rate, 3.7 million views. and 17k Uniques our site. ",0,0
3," My number one and most important marketing strategy to grow my traffic is my focus on consistent, high-quality content. I pay very close attention to the content I produce that performs the best and prompts the greatest engagement, and I identify what links these recipes, what makes them similar. I boil those qualities down to their simplest and use those traits to inspire me for future posts. Aside from my focus on content, I make sure to learn best practices for each of the platforms used for promotion. We focus heavily on Pinterest, as well as high-quality lead magnets to consistently increase our list, and I try to be quite active on Instagram, always following what the platforms publish as the best practices. Facebook… I just can’t with Facebook. I do, however, run a couple related groups, one of which is growing quickly and is very active. I also make sure there’s a solid SEO foundation for every post I write, focusing on logical searching rather than exactly what SEMrush.com or Google’s keyword planner says. I use Pinterest’s search population frequently for realistic searching and find that works very well for me.",1,1
4," First of all, we needed to bring students to our bootcamp. To do so, we started with pamphlets in newspapers and did some flex hanging at the most crowded roads. The morning after we hanged them, there were no banners. The municipal corporation’s van had picked them all. We again went to the same printing shop and ordered more material. This time luck was with us and we came to know that it was a monthly drill from Municipal corporation at least we had learned, We started getting calls from students and many parents. We got our first admission in the very first week. Our first batch started with the strength of 7. Soon, we hired our first employee: an intern that had worked with me at the telecom company. After getting a little money in revenue we thought about spending more on advertising. We went with a Facebook advert and the response was great. We almost rocked it and got 43 new admissions in the following week. At that point, we were running 5 batches a day and had got all the money that we had invested back in just two week’s time. A brilliant start by any means. We stopped marketing efforts, because we had a pipeline for the next 3 months. ‍",0,0
5," Eric: All the inbound interest we were receiving made us quickly see that we needed to form partnerships with businesses and influencers who recognize the value of AKKO and want to offer it to their users, viewers, etc. We have these differentiators and a unique product, but it’s been about spreading the word and building a customer base that’s allowed us to achieve a sort of critical mass.  Jared: We initially focused on students and marketing directly through and at their schools, but we found that wasn’t the best avenue for us. We started to see more adoption when we appealed instead directly to parents and administrators, who are more inclined to see the value in the protection that AKKO offers.  Eric: That was also when we added the adult and family AKKO plans, which expanded our customer base far beyond our initial implementation. It turned out that once we’d built the product, all we had to do to succeed was find our audience – which turned out to be just about everyone. Jared: We’ve been working on marketing via social media and just generally trying to grow our presence as well. We’re in an interesting position as a young company that’s seen a big jump in revenue because we’ve grown our customer base pretty rapidly. Now we’re being mentioned among the industry giants. So we always feel we have to go that extra mile to demonstrate to prospective customers that even though we’re a new face in a space dominated by the old guard, we’re legit and reliable, and we keep our promises. ‍",1,0
6," Our sales strategy relied entirely on personalized, outbound pitches from me to prospects.  Prospects were generally CHROs or Heads of Recruiting from medium or large enterprises (>1000 employees)I primarily sourced prospects via LinkedIn, then used tools like Hunter.io to infer their email addresses, and then put them onto email drip campaigns that I run using Hubspot. The cold emails had a fair amount of personalization. We had a ~3% positive response rate (willing to take a meeting or call) from these cold emails. Whenever possible, I would meet prospects in person. I would travel if the prospect was large enough or sufficiently engaged. Secondary sources of prospects were conference attendance and personal networks (Stanford/Harvard alumni network, intros from investors, intros from customers), but we fairly quickly exhausted these personal network connections. We did a little bit of marketing: Writing blog posts about HR + Data Science, better interviewing, etc.Sponsoring “HR + Data Science  Discussion and Dinner” events, where we would have ~3 guest speakers, and then invite 2-3 customers and ~10 prospects. We did not do any paid marketing ",0,0
7,"  We created a basic backlink profile for our Google presence, started a blog, and used Google Ads. So while optimizing our Google ranking we tried to target the right audience with Google Ads and later on used Facebook as well for more specific customer profiles.  We also tried cold calling for a while but realized that’s kind of a waste of time in this business. People don’t pay monthly for something they never really thought about. Well, they might, but we didn’t have any Wall Street sharks in our ranks and weren’t planning on catching uninterested fish.  After half a year we started to get in the paying customers, some big companies that would pay lots of money each month. That was a big morale boost for all of us, so we continued working on our UI, on our features, and so on. We were worried that during COVID we wouldn’t get many subscribers in, but luckily we weren’t that affected. Some major corona-testing stations signed up, with lots of registered employees.  ",1,0
8," Before we started working on Aura, we built a very large Facebook group/community (7,000+) with our target audience. Because we’re bootstrapped, we used time, instead of money, to acquire users. I shared everything I knew and was learning about selling on Amazon on our blog and sharing with our group. Eventually, other sources began picking up the content and sharing in other communities.  From there, we saw an opportunity to launch a weekly podcast specific to wholesale selling on Amazon, which is a specific business model that Vendrive CRM serves.  The combination of great content, a valuable podcast, our own community and a fantastic product allowed us to quickly launch Aura with greater ease.  The biggest strategy that I believe we deployed was getting people to know who we are as people. It’s hard trusting a brand new tool that hasn’t been tested yet. We made sure that was a non-issue for our users.  Now, a lot of our growth comes from our users sharing their success with our tool - by increasing their Amazon sales - in other Facebook groups, on Instagram and having influencers testing our products and sharing their reviews on Youtube.  When you build a great tool, influencers tend to come to you, rather than you tracking them down (hats off to James for that!).  ",1,0
9," The first strategy we used, was really simple. It consisted of distributing leaflets across a small community of 2000 houses. Given that we converted only 1 customer, we decided to try other strategies. The next strategy was guerrilla marketing, which consisted of setting up car service camps in large apartment communities, with more than 2000 flats. This method proved to be very successful in attracting new customers, but it was really expensive. On our very first stall, we provided services to 25 cars in only two days, which was a much higher conversion rate than the leaflets. But at the same time, the cost per customer acquisition was at $12. Moreover, we also conducted some service camps on weekends, when most people were at home instead of working, which gave us better results. To reduce the acquisition cost of customers, we introduced a free eco-wash with every service bought. Surprisingly, many customers wanted just the eco-wash as a paid service. So, we introduced it with a great success. But we then realized we were losing money per wash. In India, most cars in apartments are washed and cleaned by washing facilities located within the apartment communities. Therefore, to compete against them we had to underprice massively. ‍",0,0
10," Speaking of testing ideas. This rule works perfectly well when it comes to marketing, too. We started off by validating the Awesomic business concept in our local community close to our target audience. That's why, probably, the word of mouth and referrals worked pretty well for us since the beginning. Our favorite and most effective advertisement, though, was a simple napkin. There was a big conference in our coworking space one day, and many projects pinned their well-designed business cards to the board in the elevator. So what could get more attention than a usual napkin with a poorly written website address and the words ""design from $399""? This simple move helped us attract first clients, and no other marketing activity could beat it in the amount of feedback we got. To be honest, we had a great advantage over other projects. Our initial name was Pizdata, which is ""f**king awesome"" in Ukrainian. This helped us get media coverage, hype, and go viral in CIS countries. People became interested in what we did, and it gave us extra motivation. To increase brand awareness, we also worked with different media, attended TV shows, and gave interviews. But our breakout point was getting on Product Hunt since we finally reached the global market. It was unforgettable!  Recently, we've merged our Marketing and Sales department into one Growth team. This helps us see the whole funnel at once and complement each other's activities.  So here is our third insight - run a list of hypotheses and keep testing them regularly. This way, you will find your product-market fit and never miss a chance to improve your project. ‍",1,0
11," I am a big believer in giving before taking. And that's why I decided to build a content engine around BaseTemplates. I create valuable content like blog articles, free tools, interviews like this, and more that I use to bring people to our website. If they like the content, they will convert at some point into paying customers. Using this strategy, we have not spent a single $ on marketing for our product. One thing that was particularly helpful for us was working with partners. There are plenty of sites that are targeting early-stage founders. Many of them are happy to include BaseTemplates as an additional service for their customers. Over the last years, this strategy helped us to go from hundreds of $ per month in revenues to over 5-digits per month. ‍",1,0
12," At each stage of our business, we employed different marketing tactics based on the market and our cash flows. Early in the business, when we were cash poor, we spent a lot of time in the world of content. That meant tons of time on social media, YouTube, Tumblr, and Reddit. We tried to provide as much value to the community as possible and deliver world-class customer experience. As we generated more cash, we started dipping our toes into paid marketing channels. Our early investments were primarily focused on remarketing tools as well as PR. We also did a bit of influencer marketing, but never paid to have our products endorsed. We only want authentic connections with our brand and products. We continued to grow and have invested more into paid marketing through Facebook and Google. We’ve seen some success there, but we still aren’t at the level that I think our brand should be at. So, with the moderate success in paid, we’ve decided to focus on what we do best - content. Our top focus has been cranking out quality videos on YouTube daily, in-depth and thorough blog articles, and well-organized email marketing campaigns. Pair that with unique social media posts, and we feel we have something that stands out in a crowded market. ‍",1,0
13," I don’t think I’ve made clear how ignorant I was. I knew literally nothing about marketing or sales. I read marketing books, I spoke to marketing experts but all of this expertise had one thing in common: it assumed a certain amount of understanding of the basic subject matter. Books seemed to concentrate on “101 ideas to market your business!” experts simply nodded, smiled and took lots of money from me. It took me the better part of two years to recognize that marketing was different from sales and business strategy was different from both. Before that, I was just throwing ideas around and seeing what would stick. I did, however, pick up a few important things. Any experienced business owner will probably read every one of these and say “no kidding”, but here goes: Business to business marketing is a totally different animal to business to consumer. It isn’t unusual to find marketing people specialize in one of these.B2B marketing - particularly for high-value services - is very much carried out the old-fashioned way. You need to develop a relationship with your customers over a long period of time you simply can’t phone someone up on Monday, pay them a visit on Wednesday and have a signed contract by Friday. Brad Burton (owner of 4Networking) said it best with “Meet, like, know, trust.” It’s something he repeats like a mantra and he’s absolutely right there.The sort of things you can market to a small business - and the strategies you employ to do so - are also quite different to what you might use to appeal to a larger business.Yes, networking can be a great way to get yourself known and meet new prospects. But be very careful about signing up to an organization offering regular networking meetings - they’re often full of people who’ve been suckered into a pyramid scheme.Marketing to small business is probably rather closer to B2C: develop a product that solves a problem and sells that. If you can’t explain the problem you’re solving in ten seconds, you probably don’t understand it well enough.The problems that bother small businesses are typically closer to “how will I get the money in to meet payroll?” and “if this invoice isn’t paid, I’m not going to be able to cover the mortgage next month”. More abstract questions like “am I working in the most efficient way possible?” seldom appear on the radar frankly, even if I’d offered my services for nothing it wouldn’t have helped because my prospective customers wouldn’t have been prepared to sacrifice the time to speak to me. ‍",0,0
14," I chose the online dating industry as our beachhead market because online trust and safety were so obviously important there (more on that later). We used the Techstars network and our personal networks and got introductions to two dating sites that became our first beta testers. The algorithm needed to be validated - we needed dating sites that would use BeehiveID and then validate whether we correctly identified the fraudulent users. The founders we worked with were passionate about creating safe online communities and we couldn’t have developed BeehiveID without them. We also blogged and did all the traditional content marketing. Later, we spoke at trade shows for the online dating industry and were able to reach out to the larger companies in the space. By the time we shut down, we had personally spoken to the majority of the dating industry, large and small and we eventually realized that even though most of them claimed to be very concerned about fraudulent accounts, in reality, they knew a huge percentage of their accounts were fake and had no desire to do anything about it. ‍",0,1
15," We are super early here, but so far, the best marketing has been word of mouth and providing incredible customer support. Traction started early with a waitlist, but we quickly learned that Bildr being on the more advanced side of visual development tooling, many of the early signups were not a good fit for the product. One of the lessons learned during this process is recognizing and being happy about this outcome. To define your customer, sometimes you also need to know who is not your customer.",1,0
16," Well, don’t let me get started on how many strategies, tactics, and methods I have changed over the years.  But, I do not dwell on my mistakes. They are just reminders of the many milestones I had to pass to get to where I am now. And I’m well aware that where I am now is not my final destination. There are many goals I have yet to reach and realize.  At first, when I founded BizzBee, I made the mistake of relying solely on freelance platforms. Using freelancing platforms as a source of work did last spring, but it couldn’t serve me for the long run since my business was expanding, and I had more and more employees to get busy working.  That’s how I started using LinkedIn and email outreach as my primary business strategies.  It did take me a while to learn how to do outreach the right way, and I am still learning, but I realized that it was what I did best and what I wanted to continue doing.  Mastering the art of doing outreach, whether via LinkedIn or Email, goes hand in hand with mastering the art of creating mind-blowing content.  That’s why I have carefully gathered a small team of first-class copywriters that create awe-inspiring content as they breathe. And my next business steps are related exactly to content creation, so do put your seatbelts on and prepare for some seriously adventurous ride!",1,0
17," The main thing I’ve done to grow Blogging for Devs is building word-of-mouth growth into the product. For example, right after someone confirms their email address for the free course, I ask them to share the course on Twitter. I do the same after the person has completed the challenge. This ensures there’s always a steady stream of people publicizing the product for me. Another funny side effect is that by helping developers blog, they often end up writing about my site: this results in backlinks and more people talking about the newsletter in public spaces where developers hang out. These days, visitors from Twitter subscribe at a rate of 20-30% on the newsletter homepage. Even higher when the recommendation to join comes from someone else who’s respected as a tech blogger (sometimes over 60% opt-in rate!). So it’s by far the most effective way for me to grow the email list. One thing that hasn’t panned out yet is using my rankings of the top developer blogs to get subscribers through organic traffic. I still need to experiment with what kind of email opt-in formats are going to appeal to developers when visiting these rankings, without annoying them too much. As you might know, developers are sensitive to popups and impervious to most lead magnets. So it takes a lot for a random dev online to surrender their email address. In terms of revenue growth, the email course acts like a funnel for people to join the community. Students get the fundamentals they need to act, and the option to join the community and work on their blogs with a group of peers in two final emails at the end of the course. One announcement email, one with FAQs. I can’t say they are perfectly optimized, but it’s the main way people hear about the community and eventually join us as paying members. ",1,1
18," We tried everything! We handed out flyers. We tried organic search. We tried paid search. You name it, we did it. We tried everything to get the word out. We started to gain traction as we picked up more customers and people got used to seeing the name Bounce around the city. We began to get recommendations from people in tourism-facing industries. People would ask a concierge at a hotel or an attendant at a museum where they could store their bags, and they would recommend Bounce. Word-of-mouth was very valuable to us as a new company. ‍",1,0
19," We serve businesses between 25 and 300 people, and divided that target market into a few core segments: for example, the “WeWork Graduate” is a 25 person company that has relied on co-working but is ready to invest in their first space. Within each segment, we identified a key decision-maker (who might be a CEO at a smaller company, or a facilities manager at a larger company). Our clients can spend tens of thousands of dollars with us, so segmenting and understanding their needs is key to driving successful outreach and conversion.  We also spent a fair amount of time mapping user journeys for each segment. Because office furniture is a large, complex and important purchase to most clients, lead generation for our sales team is the primary focus of our acquisition funnel, although we expect ecommerce transactions to grow in volume as we add social proof and case studies.  We generate those leads and transactions in three ways. Online acquisition is important for us, and until recently we’ve focused on driving organic traffic through content marketing and PR, which generate direct traffic and improve our search rankings by driving backlinks to our site. I can’t overstate the importance of PR as a new startup. It can be tough to land coverage, but every article you land has a triple impact on your funnel: driving direct traffic, generating a powerful SEO backlink, and providing credibility that can improve conversion. Now that we have a new brand and website, we’re beginning to experiment with paid search ads.  Beyond online channels, we acquire customers through direct sales and channel partners in the real estate and design communities. In general, we prioritize growth channels by scale potential, cost and purchase intent: office furniture is mostly purchased at certain points in a company’s lifecycle, so channels like search that directly capture intent in the query are especially valuable to us relative to social channels, which target the right people but not necessarily at the right time.  ‍",1,0
20," I tried all the ones you tend to hear about: posting on big-name sites like Product Hunt and others. For better or worse the user-base for this project is quite a niche, so big audiences tend not to like it as much. What really worked well was posting it on more niche sites like IndieHackers, web-development sub-reedits and (again) GitHub issues! This isn’t scalable, or really a pursuit I’m willing to keep up with, however it got a few users using the product which helped start a positive feedback mechanism and encouraged me to keep working on it. Since then I’ve been trying to keep up on our blog and write about doing common things with headless browsers. These can be as boring as getting Chrome to run properly on Linux, or as cool as how Codepen has used the service for their product. ‍",1,0
21," Our growth has been very organic since the beginning. We knew we could build the product no problem, but we had zero knowledge about marketing. The toughest part has been to reach the right people to let them know about our product. After taking the EU grant we had a mentor (hello Agustín!) who insisted we had to do content marketing. What the heck was that? We did not know much. He had us do an exercise: He asked us to do some keyword research and he provided some guidance. Then we chose the top 20 keywords we thought would have the biggest impact on our growth and we set ourselves to work on those. Our goal was to appear on the first page on Google after 6 months for at least 10 of those keywords. This is easier said than done—improving SEO takes a lot of work! The three founders of Bugfender happened to be engineers. At that moment, that was our entire team. Engineers aren’t super into writing, and this required writing, lots of it. So, it proved a doubly challenging feat for an engineer. But we set to it and we made it. We not only appeared on the first page in many of our keyword searches, but we made it to first place for some. This helped our growth a great deal because for the first time we had a significant amount of organic traffic coming to our site. We also tried other things that did not work. We had other mentors recommending AdWords, Facebook ads, LinkedIn ads, Twitter ads. All of these options made sense to us, so we tried them out. We spent a significant amount of time and money setting everything up and paying bill after bill, testing and pivoting. Though it worked that we got more visitors, we were still spending much more than we made back in new users and, ultimately, purchases. I would say it was worth trying but I would recommend bootstrapped companies try other things first and be very conservative with ad spending. When using ads, you are competing against big companies with huge marketing budgets. I would reserve this strategy for VC-backed companies with a low-barrier for customer acquisition, like free products. We have had a good experience with Facebook retargeting. We show ads to people who have expressed some interest in Bugfender by visiting our website at some point. This has been a much more successful strategy, since we are targeting individuals, instead of big groups, with a much higher chance to turn them into customers. We also thought our customers would be so excited to use Bugfender that they would share it. We built a whole referral system with promo codes and invitations, similar to the strategy Dropbox uses and is well known for. We were wrong, people had better things to do. They were happy using our product but talking their friends into using it was a different thing. We also tried participating in social networks: Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, but we found they are already too full of marketing messages. Having a meaningful interaction is extremely time-consuming and in the end, everyone is trying the same tricks, so it is very difficult to stand out in the crowd. We have recently found, though, being more active on Twitter helped us, probably because developers hang out more on Twitter, so we are doubling our efforts there while reducing the activity in other networks. We also tried A/B testing for improving our website content. Even if in theory it sounds good, you need many thousands of visitors to your website in order to extract meaningful results. And often those tests are inconclusive just because there is not much difference between the things you tried, or the impact in your conversion rate is so tiny it does not matter, so we have found them not very useful for our case  So, for now, we know content marketing is our hobby horse and we keep working on it. But we have not stopped trying new things and we will keep trying we will never stop, probably, since times change and companies change. Maybe some things we tried in the past might eventually work in the future. ‍",1,0
22," We took distribution very seriously, right from the beginning. Even if we did not have a specialized department when we started, we tried to use the power of word of mouth.  We started talking about Bunnyshell and our plans to anyone who would listen: our friends, our ex-colleagues, everyone from the IT community with whom we've ever interacted. Asking our network about their network helped us a lot. We created partnerships with cloud providers like Microsoft and DigitalOcean and that really helped us with the trust factor that we needed to show to our customers. When you’re talking about your production, you’re talking about your business. So it’s very important to find a trustworthy partner.  When we launched the Bunnyshell Beta version, we went back to all the people we'd talked to and gave them the opportunity of testing the platform. We received lots of feedback and found that the IT community is generally happy to help.  Then we started to go to conferences, talk about Bunnyshell, and about our mission to democratize the Cloud. That, alongside social media, has been a good place to start.  We started to see traction from the beginning and we’ve had some pretty big, important clients that showed trust in us even though the platform was in its early stages. Our first clients were a pharma company, then an eCommerce platform, then an eCommerce store. They helped us with feedback and we improved day-by-day.  It’s been almost 2 years since we started Bunnyshell. It might not seem like a lot, but it was a very intense period for all of us, with all the feedback and changes and strategies adopted to find the perfect market fit.  We’re now testing 4 different strategies to grow our customer base: 2 strategies for marketing, 2 for sales. The first phase was to validate the idea, the second phase to validate the product. Now we are working to find out our product-market-fit.  Even if, in the beginning, it seemed hard to define and redefine the product after getting feedback, it helped a lot. We can now look at the platform and say that we’re proud of what we've done there. So, my piece of advice for anyone that wants to start a business: nothing is possible without listening to your customers' feedback and improving your product to cover their needs. You build the product for them, not for you.  This is a very tough lesson for entrepreneurs. You build your entire company not for yourself, but for your customer. If you cover their needs - then they will give you their money and attention. ‍",1,0
23," We began by advertising on Facebook and Instagram, using videos to tell our story and educate consumers about the brand and what makes it unique. Metta and Robert have been great brand ambassadors helping represent the brand and bring awareness, so that has helped grow the Buttercloth audience and gotten us a foot in the door in the menswear fashion space. Slowly, we have added additional channels that today include Google, YouTube, eMail, SMS, and affiliate marketing. ‍",1,0
24," Facebook and the media are our best friends for marketing.  At first, we were doing paid advertising on Facebook and boosting our posts here and there. But, after simply posting about Campertunity to various camping group pages, we found that we were not only getting the attention of the public, but of journalists.  Soon, we were being interviewed for TV, radio, podcast, newsprint and online media, and it hasn’t stopped exploding. Our media attention is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and with every article or broadcast about us, we gather a few dozen new users and listings. This is where our people skills come in handy because giving an interview, either on paper, phone or in-person, takes practice and a persona.  ‍ Paid advertising hasn’t been an option for us because our budget has been blown to build Campertunity, so not much can be said on that. But, with all the media attention I’m gratefully receiving (for free!), I don’t know why I would bother with paid advertising.  What about our revenue? The Campertunity website is maintained thanks to the 10% profit that is taken from each booking. With no annual fees and no cost to sign up, our motto to landowners is, “We don’t make money unless you make money.” With just over 400 users and 50 listings, with more joining Campertunity every day, we are thrilled to have some of our first bookings this summer and will continue to grow our revenue.  ",1,1
25," To be honest, we’re still figuring out what works best. Currently, my co-founder and I go out and visit venues. Once we’re there, we ask to speak to whoever is in charge of booking live music, which is usually the bar manager. We ask about their current way of booking live music and then show them what Canary can do. Most bar managers are looking for an easier way to book live music, so it becomes one of those things that’s an easy decision. In the beginning, using Canary wasn’t an easy decision for them. The main reason was that our technology didn’t have all the features that they needed. Canary is now very flexible and we’ve made the onboarding process for venues, which was the biggest bottleneck, super easy. Initially, I would call venues and try to sell them Canary over the phone. Once I was speaking with the live music booker, I would just start selling to them by explaining all the features we have and why it will save them time. That failed miserably. It’s so easy for someone to say they are not interested on the phone and hang up. I actually got quite discouraged in the beginning since I was getting rejected so much. Once we changed up tactics from phone to in person, we had more successes. It felt amazing to get users on and actually start booking gigs. We are also changing up how we sell in person. If you listen to Simon Sinek speak about how leaders inspire action, you’ll learn that people buy why you’re selling, not what you’re selling. It’s more important to talk about what you believe instead of a list of features. Here’s the difference: “What we’re selling” approach: We made an app to makes booking live music easier. You can find new talent to book, book your existing musicians in a few taps, and handle communication and scheduling all in the app. Want to try it? “Why we’re selling” approach: Everything we do, we believe in connecting the music scene in Boston. We believe that you should focus on what matters to you, and that booking live music should be easy. The way we do that is by creating a beautifully designed app that’s simple to use. As a venue, you can find new talent to hire, book your existing talent with a few taps, and handle all communication and scheduling with minimal effort. Want to try it? See the difference? The second approach has more emotion behind it and is easier to buy into. It’s just a more powerful pitch. For getting musicians on, we just asked ourselves: Where are musicians hanging out online? They are mostly on Facebook posting their music and Craiglist trying to find new gigs. We post there with the “why we’re selling” approach and just change a few words around to make it apply to the musician. Musicians are pretty receptive to it, especially since it’s free for them and they only have upside.",1,0
26," We’ve always been focused on organic marketing. Organic search is our biggest traffic source. Of our 1,000,000+ monthly visitors, more than 80% come from search. Here is the general trend of our monthly pageviews from 2015 to the Present: Quora has also been fantastic for us, and the answers I’ve written years ago continue to bring in views and website clicks. I haven’t written answers on Quora for approximately two years, yet you can still see steady views on my content: Pinterest has been surprisingly good, too, especially if you set your website images to have a “Pin” button that invites people to pin the image when they hover their mouse. That’s one of my favorite, easy-to-implement tricks because it gets other people sharing your website for you. LinkedIn has also been excellent since Career Sidekick is in a business-related niche. I’ve found LinkedIn to be a “blue ocean” with less competition and more opportunities than other big social platforms like Facebook and Instagram. There are just fewer high-caliber marketers with great tactics on LinkedIn, meaning it's easier to stand out and build a following. I wrote about this for Social Media Examiner and revealed some of the ways I grew to 200,000+ followers while being named a LinkedIn Top Voice in 2019. LinkedIn has become a bit more competitive this past year, but it’s still easier than most of the other big social sites. LinkedIn was also incredibly valuable in terms of building connections and relationships with industry peers. These relationships got me article features (from other blogs, but also big news sites and journalists), podcast appearances, partnership opportunities, and more. I think LinkedIn was our most valuable marketing channel, aside from organic search/SEO, because of the direct traffic it drove and the relationships and opportunities it opened for me as a founder. If I could only do two things to promote my site, it’d be SEO and LinkedIn. In terms of revenue, we’ve slowly rolled out e-books on various topics as the site has grown, and then developed a job search video course after that. We looked at what topics were doing best on the blog and wrote books around those topics. This seemed logical for two reasons. First, we know the topics are popular and relevant to people in general. Second, we already have traffic coming to our site looking for help with these exact areas, so we know we’ve got “warm” leads. We’re not big on launches, unlike many online info businesses. We usually just do a quiet launch where we work these products into our email sequences, set the product to be offered as an up-sell or down-sell after other purchases if relevant, etc. We’ve never done a big, attention-grabbing launch. That may be a missed opportunity that I can look into in the future. Beyond our products, we’ve also started capitalizing on affiliate partnerships and display ads through Mediavine (they’re a fantastic ad network and I can’t recommend them enough). For affiliate partnerships, we’ve been able to refer visitors to career coaches, resume writers, online coding bootcamps, e-learning platforms like Skillshare and LinkedIn Learning, and many other services that can help job seekers beyond what we offer. However, we focused on traffic and growth first. We didn’t monetize for the first few years. And even now, people often come to our homepage and are unsure how we earn money at first glance. I like that! Here is what the site’s homepage looks like now: ‍",1,0
27," Marketing was one of those areas in which we tried a lot of different tactics. Eventually, it solidified to four main marketing strategies, which generated almost all of our customers. First and foremost was Facebook advertising. I never used Facebook advertising before Chowdy and I was skeptical of how effective it would be. But within days of setting it up, it was generating a steady flow of sign-ups. The acquisition cost was also very low, averaging no more than a few dollars per conversion, making this channel extremely critical to our growth. I would say Facebook ads gave us around 50% of our customers over the lifetime of Chowdy. We tried advertising on other platforms, notably Google Adwords and LinkedIn, but they were not very effective for us and we gave up on them after a while. The second most important strategy was customer referral. We copied what Uber did and gave each customer a referral code, and gave both the referrer and referral $10 off their purchase. This accounted for around 25% of the customers. Even though it was a very expensive marketing channel at $20 per acquisition, we felt we had to do it simply because it has become such a standard practice. The third strategy was Search Engine Optimization. Through various efforts (many of which were frankly accidental, like getting featured on a national newspaper), we eventually ranked within the top 3 Google results for “Toronto meal delivery” and “Toronto food delivery”. This allowed us to get a steady source of sign ups from people who were looking specifically for services like ours. This accounted for around 20% of the customers. The last strategy was seasonal discount. We would offer a discount code on our website, Facebook ads, as well as our social media accounts on average once every other month. Every time we put up a discount, we saw a noticeable increase in sign-ups. This accounted for around 5% of our customers. We also tried a bunch of strategies that did not work. Notably: Giving out sample meals at local gyms: extremely expensive and did not generate a single customerPhysical cards with discount codes at our hubs: expensive to create and did not generate that many sign upsSponsoring sporting events: to be fair we didn’t spend a lot of money doing this, but we sponsored an athlete (who was a friend) for a while and did not get any sign ups from that ‍",0,0
28," We launched Circle in August 2020. From January until August, all we did in terms of marketing was to create a landing page with an email waiting list. We were able to grow that list to thousands of people who expressed their interest in the tool.  When users subscribed to the waiting list, they also had to fill a survey saying who they were, how they wanted to use Circle, what they were trying to accomplish, what their use case was, and what were they willing to pay for it. Based on their responses, we decided if it was a great fit or not. If it was, we invited the user to a free trial of the beta version. Once the trial ended, we told the user about Circle’s monthly price and hopefully, it would pay. To better onboard the customers and get their feedback, we did hundreds of 1-on-1 demos. It was a really manual process - I had around 7-10 onboarding calls every day, each of them being 30-40 minutes. However, it was a great way to grow our revenue and improve retention. During the 6 months prior to the launch, we worked really closely with our customers in order to improve the product. We had our own Circle community where customers could share ideas on how they were using Circle or thoughts on what was missing in the platform. Customers really felt connected to us and the brand, which also boosted word of mouth. I highly recommend creating a community of your customers. Eventually, we decided to carry out a public launch (here’s a post we did on Medium about it). To do so, we created a more marketing homepage, which included the stories and testimonials from some of our customers. We launched on Product Hunt and ended up as the #1 product of that day. Having a list of customers helped us achieve this position, as we announced to them that we were featured on PH that day. We also got some press coverage for our launch. We managed to get featured on TechCrunch, for example. ‍",1,0
29," In our case, paid channels worked quite well as an initial source. We started out with Facebook ads and after about a year added AdWords. I think strategies evolve as the business matures. For instance, we’re now trying to reduce the portion that paid channels account for out of the total acquired users, working on improving how our product converts, increasing referrals and LTV, etc.  A lot of things have failed down the road. We tried offline ads at airports, we tried upselling and cross-selling, various partnerships, etc. This doesn’t mean that we won’t revisit some of these things in a different shape or form, it just means that we didn’t see the value we expected and decided to concentrate on other things.  ‍",1,0
30," We primarily use cold email as a sales channel. Every once in a while I get someone that goes deep on Twitter and stumbles across us. The other nice thing is that someone posted on BookFace (YC’s internal chat) about us and we got a bunch of customers from that. I also had another gentleman that posted on the Entrepreneurs First slack group about us and we’re still getting a few meetings coming in from there. But overall, we haven’t started marketing yet. It is somewhat of a gestalt when we cold email our prospects. They open the cold email, read it, and think “Man, these guys must be good… I opened this cold email!” and they book a meeting. This is unlikely to change. Another benefit of having outbound cold email as a strategy for a young service like this is that we can somewhat control demand. It would be very easy to get overwhelmed with interest that we couldn’t support. It seems like for each 10 net new customers we bring on, we need a new process (i.e. people, i.e. expense). Scaling people processes is not my wheelhouse, and I thank my lucky stars that Mikey is now CEO of Cold Email Studio.",1,0
31," This is an interesting question because, at the time that we started our business, most marketing was done using postcards and internet ads. When starting, I took a business plan course in which I was asked to create a web page. I tried to save money and decided to do it myself. I used to think I had done a fairly good job until I read the book Building a Storybrand from Don Miller’s, which talks about clarifying your messages. This book was a wake-up call! We knew that if we were able to implement the strategies taught, it would significantly change our business. What we did then was to look for people who have been trained under the Storybrand model and that resonated well with our company. We found a guy and we decided to hire him to get our website done. It took quite a lot to be created, but in the first month of launching it, inquiries into our services increased by 500%. Another marketing strategy we used was learning how to implement copyrighting in our business. We went through Ray Edwards’ Copywriting Academy where we learned how to create our own email copy campaigns. Nowadays, we work on SEO and email marketing. ‍",1,0
32," We started like most people, on Facebook. That’s where people spend their time, so that’s where we advertise. The company started with fun posts and videos. It’s evolved into a process involving targeting, measuring attribution, and adjusting our content to reflect the highest returning initiatives. There’s no secret sauce here. You simply need to try out what works, measure, improve, repeat. Be authentic. Whenever we attempt a “best practice,” the results are not as good as when we generate authentic content. Try, measure, improve. Repeat. Public relations and media have been good for us. Find media or influencers with bigger followings that you, reach out, and see if they have interest in your product. If they talk, write, or broadcast your product--the people will come. After five years of working, adjusting, and improving, we have a core team of three that comes up with ideas, builds creative, and produces content to support sales. ",1,0
33," Marketing definitely was a big challenge because we had not taken into account the branding of our company when we got started. Our logo was portrayed to be more in the education space than we were as a platform and our name (Community Coders) didn’t particularly help when we explained to businesses that we did more than just help them with their website, such as having students build their social media following.  We knew of this challenge pretty early on when we started cold calling and going door to door to learn and start pitching some local businesses for our earlier pilot project that we were launching. Therefore one of the biggest issues of when we tried to do marketing was that our message was a bit confusing, especially to local businesses. Most of the time, the instant question that was raised was “How the hell does coding apply to me?”. When we understood that this was a challenge, we did try to make a conscious to re-brand (such as a name like Community Digital), but I believe that one of the mistakes I made was being so stuck with the brand, and hesitant to change because of the identity that we already developed (even though it wasn’t that big or well known). When it came down to marketing on the student side, there were several strategies that were extremely effective, but I cannot stress the importance of developing unique, one on one relationships with each person that could potentially be of value to your business. The one strategy that stood out to me most was events and offline connections. More in the later stage of Community Coders, we were able to partner and work with organizations such as the League of Innovators, SFU Venture Connections and Canada’s best coding bootcamps. We hosted events for motivated high school students providing workshops or panels. This helped us get a ton of students (about 20% of students joined our facebook group), and turned out to be an amazing way to meet highschool students who were motivated to get real work experience.  Another marketing tactic that worked was posting on our own personal social, (especially LinkedIn) to drive awareness. I understood the importance and also the advantages both from a student learning perspective, and that documenting my own journey - from ideation to execution is something I would suggest for all aspiring entrepreneurs. It builds traction, credibility, and also undiscovered, potential referrals! Here’s a couple pictures of one of our events: And this was our logo: Most of the marketing strategies that didn’t work all had to do when we are trying to get local businesses. Here’s a list of what didn’t work for us (this doesn’t mean that it wouldn’t work for you):  Cold Calling: It was just way too saturated. Funny enough, digital marketers call local businesses all the time and we didn’t have a unique value proposition. In fact, when we said that highschool students who want work experience are going to craft your online presence, it put us at a disadvantage. Our name didn’t help either when we tried introducing ourselves.Door to Door: We started off trying to sell door to door (funny enough, we actually got one), but our conversion rates were extremely low and also didn’t provide an enjoyable customer experience for potential buyers. Imagine a university student walking in, pitching you on a website package with no portfolio during a time you were working 😂.Facebook Ads: To do Facebook Ads properly, I think you have to be pretty well versed in both the analytics/design/copywriting aspect, and it was pretty hard for us to get meaningful results as we were not experienced in this section.SEO & Website: Funny enough, we were never successful in getting leads online. We had no SEO (if you search up coding there’s so much other stuff), tried blog writing (but there the local/small business internet advice niche is pretty saturated), and was pretty unsuccessful for Google Ads as well. We also kept making new websites and designs and should have put more emphasis on our website.  Simply put, we always struggled with getting businesses to hire us for projects. Branding was also difficult because whenever we introduced our company, businesses were confused as coding had no relevance to them. Personally, I believe that although the company name doesn’t matter, it can’t be misleading. ",0,0
34," It’s crazy when I look back at how many things we tried. If I told you about all of them, the answer to this question could fill an entire book. I was even documenting everything we did but had to stop because it was getting too much. It has been pretty difficult, to be honest. There are SO many different ways to attract new users, and there’s no way to know which will actually work. So, you just have to test them as fast as possible. The two biggest things for us have been: Our Facebook groupA giveaway From day 1, I began building a Facebook group of web designers. These are our target audience, so having direct access to so many of them allows us to better understand how they think and what kind of things they need to improve their business and lives. Through this group, I’ve even made a bunch of friends, several who I’ve met in real life. After this, the most effective marketing ‘tactic’ we used was a giveaway. In the early days, this got many people talking about us in various groups, and doubled our email list in 2 days. One tactic that didn’t work as well I thought it would, was Product Hunt. In the startup world, a lot of people put weight on getting to #1 on Product Hunt. We *almost* did that, except Facebook TV launched on the same day. So, we hit #2 instead. It drove a huge traffic spike, quite a few comments and more than 10x our normal daily signups, but none of them converted to paid users. I wish I could say that there were one or two things that just smashed it out of the park and resulted in explosive growth, but it’s just not the case. Our growth comes from lots of small things adding together, adding a few users at a time. ‍ Here are a few things we’ve tried and have worked to at least a small extent: Getting interviewed on podcastsGuest postsHelpful, quality blog postsSharing those posts in places where people need the helpSEO on keywords our audience is looking forEmail competitions/giveawaysBetaListProductHunt ‍",1,0
35," Our goal is to inspire more entrepreneurs. That means being very transparent about our journey. As a result, Twitter and the Building in Public movement has been our best channel to date. We’re fortunate to have a lot of word of mouth which has been our top of the funnel in attracting users. ‍",1,0
36," Since we are designers and branding thinkers ourselves, we know where creative-type industry folks hang out, what websites they are reading, which thought leaders they are following, etc. One example: right after our product Beta launch, we created a beautifully crafted product landing page that got a web design award in a particular award organization we picked out to be showcased. It created traffic and interest. The first paying client was impressed by our design craftsmanship and customer service. And above everything, I was personally talking with every user in the early days, which formed trust and confidence in the product although it was in the MVP stage.  ",1,0
37," Arnoldo: Initially, we began promoting and selling our first policies to our family members and friends, but as you can imagine, we got to a point at which this wasn’t just scalable anymore. We then decided to jump into Google Ads and began running performance campaigns but soon discovered that this was not economically feasible at such an early stage.   We were unaware that the auto insurance industry is one of the most competitive niches regarding Pay per Click marketing. For this reason, we decided to temporarily pause this growth tactic and search for a more efficient alternative. The next thing we tried was collaborating with online aggregators which specialized in lead generation. We partnered with one of Mexico’s top auto insurance comparison sites and quickly began our 2 digit growth month-over-month. This helped us scale rapidly and create a relatively extensive customer base to test our operations. We also set our eyes on organic growth and began optimizing our site’s SEO. Our team worked over a couple of months to create a blog that touched every part of the inbound marketing funnel. This past July, we released it with over +90 informational articles. This one tactic has helped us increase our organic traffic from 3K visitors per month to almost 70K per month in about 3 months. And we are now in the process of optimizing our conversion rates to increase our lead generation. We are growing our revenue by improving our product based on customer feedback. We are also opening new cities & states regularly to increase our presence nationwide. Finally, we are focusing on enhancing our renewal rates. ",1,1
38," Every time we set up CROSSNET we always gather an impressive crowd. Our four-way net turns heads because nobody has ever seen anything like it before. We quickly figured out that if we were getting this reaction, all of our customers were probably experiencing a similar thing. This meant it was vital to get as many nets out into the world as possible and spread them out across the United States to reach as many customers as possible. We were very selective with ambassadors and influencers who we thought would have the best following and pull in their local communities. We also sought out influencers who had a consistent history of putting out high quality, engaging content. We would offer product exchanges for a video and story post and saw our brand grow overnight. We would then repurposes the best of the best videos and run Facebook and Instagram ads with them to generate revenue.  When starting off with this strategy we learned that if we continued to send out tons of units on a limb and prayer that the influencer would actually create the content we would quickly find ourselves in the red and out of tons of money and product. When selecting an influencer we will always get their personal phone number, email address, and have a way to contact them. There is nothing worse than getting your message left unread by dozens of influencers after shelling out hundreds of dollars to ship your product out and having no idea if you’ll ever see content created. We’ve learned to start small, build trust with your connections and scale from there.  After using the videos to create traffic to the site we are constantly looking at data to determine where customers are dropping off, how we can build motivation, and increase conversion. A few helpful applications that Shopify users should be using are Privy, Klayvio, Hotjar, and Carthook. When starting off with a lean budget we used Privy to capture emails and provide discounts to increase conversion. Hotjar can be used to find where customers are dropping off and will allow you to quickly identify the weakest points of your website. Carthook is an incredible application that we just started using that transforms the checkout process from three pages to one, this has increased our conversion by almost 1%, which is hundreds of thousands of dollars across the year.   ",1,0

 ‍ I also have a blog, joshwcomeau.com. The blog posts are essentially “deep dive” versions of the tweets. They’re mainly on the topic of JS and CSS, though I have some posts about career and personal development. My goal in mid-2019 was to publish 1 post every 2 weeks. My nerve injury got in the way of that goal, but I’ve managed to publish about 60 posts since then. It gets between 60-90k unique visits a month, according to Google Analytics. When people visit my blog, they’re asked to join my newsletter. About 20k people have opted in so far. I have two other email lists managed with ConvertKit.

40," We thought the app would sell itself. It was packed with amazing features that no other dating app had (there was no friction for users at all, every feature of the app was available for unpaid users), the design was incredible, and we threw a really great launch party in LA. We launched on Android first, since that had 90% of the mobile market at the time (everyone else was launching on iOS). We had, on a punch list, addressed every concern investors could possibly have about the sustainability of the business model. We honestly thought that the app was so well designed, so accessible, and removed so much friction that it would naturally take off. Our first indication that we’d made a really big mistake by launching on Android is when every single tech blogger and reporter who showed up at our launch party had an iPhone. Little did we know at the time that it’s really hard to grow the audience for a dating app. Earned media is almost essential, and I really blew it by deciding to launch on Android. This was an absolutely critical error, and we’d have saved ourselves a lot of time and money by just shutting down then.  Most dating apps are segmentation plays, and there is only room for a couple of market leaders who can take advantage of a technology shift. Unfortunately, Grindr, Tinder, and Bumble had been first to market on mobile and had captured the vast majority of broad-based audiences. All that was really left were segmentation plays. We also quickly discovered that we had almost nothing in common with mainstream audiences, so couldn’t create relatable marketing collateral for these audiences on our own. We’re all geeks, so what we did that eventually worked was to revert to our authentic selves. We tweaked the app to relate to geeks like us, and we started promoting the app in person to geek audiences at geek events like comic-cons and anime conferences. This truly resonated--we were a dating app by and for geeks. We started to get earned media coverage, became one of the top dating apps in Spain (for some reason, the app wasn’t in Spanish and we had never done any marketing there), and we literally created the category of geek dating apps, becoming the #1 app in the category. People loved our app so much that they asked us how they could help. We responded by sending them “Ambassador Packs” with a Cuddli T-shirt, flyers and stickers which they could distribute at their favorite geek spots to help Cuddli grow. Yes, users loved our app so much that they were literally doing work for free to help us grow. I’d like to say that our marketing was deliberate brilliance but we literally just made things up as we went along and doubled down on everything we found that was working. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a large enough category, which I’ll get to in the next section. ‍",0,0
41," Initially, my marketing strategy was: Grow my SEO and domain authority right off the bat, 3 months prior to our January 2020 launch, but due to the complications with my React-based app, as I mentioned previously, Google was unable to accurately locate my online content. On top of that, Google remained thinking my whole site was only one page.Bring in as many companies with a high online reputation into my platform as soon as possible. We partnered with over 80 businesses within the first 3 months and growing. Companies are ecstatic to join a modern business directory listing that’s actually dedicated to helping them grow. For the businesses lacking online reviews or having too many negative reviews, we provide review management. This is where we help create a strategic roadmap to implement and drastically increase the percentage of reviews from their clients, partners, and vendors. Many companies, especially in unique niches like Background Screening, simply believe that only pissed off customers leave reviews, which is far from the truth. They just simply don’t understand how to have a proper plan for review management.Educating the audience on real essential business software, by creating an intelligent and interactive advisor bot that provides your company’s top software service choices in seconds.

Most people don’t know exactly what type of software they need, if it’s compatible with their industry or if it’s the most affordable solution. Since the most recent study shows 94% of people don’t search past the first page of Google, this leaves off thousands of great companies to choose from. We’ve gone ahead and not only made software shopping simple, we’ve combined the reviews from all top review sites into each software profile. Here you can easily read reviews from the Better Business Bureau, Trustpilot, Google, Capterra, and much more.  Our goal is to provide as much transparency to shoppers so they can make the perfect choice for their business.   ‍",1,0
42," Once we finished the MVP, we thought it would be pretty easy to get people to start using the app. Turns out that was a lot harder than we thought. Our target customer was small to medium businesses, such as a small scale manufacturer that did most of their product sales in-house. We started in the niche of pet products. We chose that niche because one of my co-founders was well connected in that industry, and a lot of businesses were not currently leveraging much technology. We built a list of potential customers based on anyone we could think of. We started cold calling/emailing these customers. Responses were pretty low, but we ended up acquiring a few customers. The sales process was long for each customer, including multiple emails, sales calls and live demos of the product. We came up with some unique ways to get new customers. We went to a “health food” trade show in San Francisco and handed out personalized business cards, getting many leads and a few customers that way. We also found another trade show attendee list and email blasted everyone on the list, like 1000 people. We got a few customers that way too.  In a couple months, we had acquired about 5-10 customers who were willing to try us out.",0,0
43," Initially, I used Facebook, Craigslist, and Thumbtack but the long-term strategy was very focussed on SEO and improving our visibility on Google. SEO can take a few years before seeing a ROI but it is now by far our most successful channel. 90% of our revenue is now through SEO traffic. We found that PPC had a negative ROI for us. The CPC for the keywords in our area was quite high and we were converting very few of these clicks. PPC can be great in some industries but we found it ineffective. ‍",1,0
44," We work on creating strong content that is centered around the business of chocolate, pranks, gags, and novelty products. It is a very small niche, so there is a lot that goes into becoming the top-ranking company that sells chocolate novelties. Fortunately, my business partner understands how to set up a website to optimize so we get the most out of the time spent building content. Things like tagging, alt text, thought out page names, and sharing across multiple platforms has really helped us grow into a viable company. Secondly, we rely on outreach. I spend around 30 hours per week just banging the phones and sending out emails to potential press connections, marketing opportunities, or other companies that may be interesting in what we have going on. It’s very much like your typical sales job in that I am working every day to expand my product to a larger audience. Lastly, this product is viral in nature. People think it’s funny to post about sending a chocolate penis to someone in the mail. Because most people are not sending it to themselves, we always include an offer code and a way to get to our site in every order. It is a literally a direct marketing campaign paid for by our customers.",1,0
45," We started with an email marketing campaign. Then, we experimented with small ad campaigns on Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Reddit.  We got visitors on the website, but 1st, they weren’t converting, and 2nd, they weren’t coming back. It became obvious that the problem wasn’t in the marketing campaigns, sadly, but in the service we were selling. We weren’t the only providers of premium educational content in our niche anymore, and our strategy for differentiation (eCommerce model instead of SaaS, different partners/influencers) wasn’t successful. Very few people were interested in what we were offering. There was no product-market-fit. (The lesson here is that investing any money in paid promotion is generally speaking a waste before you’ve established a product-market fit. Paid promotion is a growth expense, and we were still in the validation phase, not in the growth phase.) We realized that we had to pivot. Even though we had invested very little resources in the promotional campaigns above, we had invested a lot in the development of the platform and the premium content in it, which meant the startup was in a bad place. We changed the business model to a traditional subscription model and at the same time changed our strategy: rather than focusing on the value to the end-consumer of the educational content, we were trying to find a model in which we create value for our content-creator/influencer partners as an additional source of income. At the same time we started an organic content marketing strategy (I talk about it in detail in this content marketing case study for those of you interested). The pivot was ultimately unsuccessful (sadly, we didn’t have the resources to test the new concept properly), but the new strategy brought new visitors and the website was growing: We used this positive trend to secure an advertising contract to keep the business alive and we were positioning ourselves for a third pivot. Sadly, the trend we were riding to grow (a new video game genre) died out and with it - our traffic started falling. This made the business unsustainable and landed us where we are at right now. ‍",0,0
46," In the beginning, we relied on cold prospecting, word-of-mouth and content marketing. Once I realized that this wasn’t going to consistently deliver enough sales opportunities for us to grow our revenue - I started running paid advertising on Facebook & Instagram. That’s developed into our largest source of leads & sales. It’s predictable, controllable, and scalable. At the time of this writing ( February 2020 ) - we generate $7 in revenue for every $1 we spend on paid advertising. We go into each quarter knowing that: If we spend around $10,000 in paid advertising dollars...We’re going to end up with roughly 310 or more completed sales/consultation calls... 20% or more of those calls will close for our consulting or training products/services ...We’ll end up with “X"" in gross revenue ( variable depending on the types of clients we brought on that quarter/the services we sold ) We’ve been able to significantly lower our cost per lead & cost per appointment by implementing custom/lookalike audiences within Facebook Ads Manager.  The “cold” interests that are offered to you inside of Ads Manager haven’t been very effective for us in any B2B campaign. Retaining our current clients for the long-term is also a way for us to maximize our marketing ROI, gross revenue and referral generation. ‍",1,0
47," I’ve relied on a mixture of strategies to grow my website and brand. First, I’ve embraced social media and I’m extremely active there. This has given me a large audience to share my content and has made it easier for people to discover my content as well.  Growing a large social media presence has made every other part of marketing easier. I can grow my mailing list from social media, run sales from social media, and drive traffic to my website from social media.  The one thing that social media is not a great help on is driving organic search traffic to my website. To tackle this problem, I’ve invested heavily in my website to make it as appealing and technically sound as possible.  To supplement the technical design of my website, I’ve learned about creating high-quality SEO content that both the search engines and people enjoy. This makes it easier to rank for keywords that drive traffic to my site and this helps expose me to more fans and customers.  ",1,0
48," Unfortunately, we didn’t have a strong marketing strategy. Our strategy was to get a set of small user groups in the mobile dev world to adapt our product. Once we did that, we started with email outreach and LinkedIn outreach which had very less impact. ‍",0,0
49," Community engagement and word-of-mouth referrals. I have experience in online community building, so I already knew how to interact with groups and the like, but I would be lying if I said that I was disciplined in my efforts. My acquisition efforts have been mostly haphazard at best, but this is something that I do want to change in the future.  However, there were a few specific milestones that have helped us grow our revenue by a large amount. Here are some of them: This became a top milestone for the day on Indie Hackers and was featured in the newsletter. I converted three Steer clients from that feature. Pretty rad.This case study tweet thread converted one Steer client and a couple of lower-tiered ones.  I also got some package clients by being active on Weekend Club, Indie London, ContentUK, Email Geeks, and the Productize Community on Facebook. It's worth having evangelists in relevant communities that will readily talk positively about your services, rather than doing the bragging yourself. Having evangelists brings more credibility to your business. Aside from that, you can always provide value by sharing your progress in a vulnerable, authentic way. Lean into the human side of growing a business and share the unsavory bits. Don't fight the funk.  I got a significant portion of my MRR (around $5,000) through personal referrals. This isn't easily repeatable, but when you've come to a point where you are steadily getting clients, remember to nurture your relationship with every single one. If your services require client-side account management, make sure that you're personable and reachable. If you're a SaaS business, automate meaningful engagement with your customers, such as through email campaigns asking them direct feedback. In the next few months, my focus is on refining and systemizing our growth processes. I'm also in the process of doubling down efforts on certain channels, namely affiliate, sales, and SEO. These will be exciting times for us! ‍",1,0
50," In terms of marketing, we’ve built a social media following on Facebook and Instagram. We’ve released campaign videos explaining the ethos of emit and our vision with starting a revolution on time. We have built a community of people who are focused on improving themselves and their lives by controlling time instead of accepting defeat to its inevitable nature. We began by building an email list of backers who were interested in emit and wanted to keep up to date with our progress and know when we launch on Kickstarter. We also used targeted ads on Facebook which we realized requires a larger budget for optimizing metrics and decided it was too expensive for us to run on a tight budget. We then started using Reddit to gain some traction from sub-Reddit on discipline, productivity and motivation. We’ve realized that getting the video out there to the right audience is the hardest bit as once we do show the concept, people are often interested at least. It feels great when people proactively reach out to us asking about emit, and when they can grab one as it makes us feel like we’ve made something that’s valuable. For Kickstarter projects, we have found that Instagram is perhaps not yet the best platform to find backers as much as it can be a great source of telling your brand story. Our university has been great in spreading the word to the wider student community and getting us in touch with other Kickstarter projects too. ‍",1,0
51," Since the validation stage, we’ve been aggressively focused on pre-launch marketing.  We have 2 goals for the pre-launch: Grow our organic/sustainable website traffic to 150 unique visits per day.Grow our email list to 3,000 subscribers before June We’re slightly behind schedule but growing steadily with both metrics. Our current list growth below. And of course, we use Encharge as our marketing automation and email sending tool :) Since we’re a bootstrapped startup, we don’t spend anything on paid acquisition. All of our traffic and leads are coming from content and resources that I create and distribute using free channels.  The marketing tactics that have worked so far are: Creating long-form posts like this one and this one and promoting them.Creating free marketing resources.Posting engagement posts on LinkedIn And growing our private Facebook group. Below, one of the engagement posts that generated over 12,000 views: ",1,0
52,"  We relied heavily on our featured experts and professionals for marketing and created an affiliate-type (though more involved) relationship wherein everyone benefits when the retreat does well.   That helped, but I also made some mistakes. Our first attempt was to offer significant discounts off our starting price through multiple channels, which didn't work as well as I hoped. I think that strategy probably diluted the value of our product, which relative to competitors, is a premium offering.   Lately, we've focused much more on partnering with local stores and groups around the country to create mutual benefit. These groups have sincere local followings in our target demographic, so we've set up opportunities for them to financially benefit by cross-promoting our retreat. For example, we have a handful of great local running specialty stores around the country that can offer their local clients a $100 gift card on us if they sign up for the retreat. It's been a win-win.  We also have a secondary revenue stream that comes from sponsors and partners. There are some impressive companies out there looking to market toward our demographic, so we’ve created partnerships with them wherein they get to take part in our event for a sponsorship fee. At its core, Endeavorun is currently set up like a professional conference business: we bring people together around a topic (running) as well as brands that are trying to access that demographic, so we can bring in revenue on both ends.   ‍",1,0
53," During the first years we focused on getting to know our target market, solidifying our business strategy and doing manual reach-outs to new potential partners to test the waters. After the initial period of understanding the market and our customers properly, we hired a head of marketing to start building a more active marketing strategy. We were (and still are) in a pretty classic startup position, where we would love to do big, splashy marketing campaigns on a shoestring budget. Luckily, there’s a lot of things we could do on minimal marketing expense.  We started by building and procuring contact lists of highly relevant experience providers, so we could focus on a personal sales approach. To raise awareness, add value and increase bookings for our partners, we’ve focused heavily on producing high quality B2C content across our blog and social media channels. We promote our partners and their activities in many ways, from exclusive interview features, activity inspiration posts to direct Book Now ads. Additionally, we create content for our partners, including tips and tricks on how to increase bookings, optimise your website and reach new markets. This focus on putting our customers at the centre of our business leads to referrals and great word-of-mouth effects. Combined with low-cost digital B2B campaigns and a strong focus on SEO, this strategy has created a steady stream of inbound lead generation. This has all worked wonders on a modest budget. Though we’re looking forward to being able to do more with greater resources, we believe that the real value will always come from keeping our customers at the centre of our business and us growing together. ‍",1,0
54," We spent a lot of time scanning WeddingWire and theKnot. We’d harvest emails of planners from those sites and send out personalized emails to each one. That was a lot of work. ‍ What tactics worked? Emailing planners, we found on the sites I mentioned. ‍ How did you approach these tactics? We had to script a scraper to obtain the emails from the sites. ‍ What didn't work? Facebook Ads. Awful ROI. Oh yea, 1 on 1 meetings with prospects was just as bad. A 1-hour meeting with a planner just to get $20/month? Will never do that again. ‍ Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous? Sometimes a mix of sweat equity and ingenuity goes a long way. So rather than just running ads or having 1 on 1 with planners, I found a middle ground. I obtained a ton of emails and I took the time to create a customizable email based on the recipient. ‍",0,0
55," I started out with social media and aimed to grow my followers on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Pinterest hoping this would drive traffic to my site and generate some users. This never really worked out for me though and I quickly discovered that Pinterest wasn’t really relevant to my audience. LinkedIn and Twitter were useful for connecting with people and finding contacts in the industry but drove very little relevant traffic to my site. I did try paying for some promoted posts on Twitter but I didn’t find this an effective channel. Facebook didn’t really work organically either but I had quite a bit of success with Facebook ads. At first, the results weren’t very good but after experimenting with my adverts I started to get a bit of traction. I was getting a couple of thousand clicks a month for about £100 so I thought I’d hit a winning strategy, all I had to do was pay for more adverts and I’d get more users! As you can imagine, this didn’t happen. Although I was getting visitors my bounce rate was high and sign-ups were very low, those that did sign up never really came back and it dawned on me that the traffic I was getting wasn’t targeted, it was people seeing an advert and having a look at what the site was but realistically most of them weren’t my target customers and I’d be unlikely to convert them. I then moved on to trying Google Adwords as I thought this would provide more targeted traffic since people were already searching for the terms I was advertising for. I got some success this way and around 20% of visitors from this source were demonstrating an interest and around 5% were signing up, which would have given me enough revenue to keep going. I also found that my click-through rates were consistently between 5 and 10% which I thought was pretty good. My main issue here was that the cost per click was pretty high since there was a lot of competition from big established companies for the keywords I was targeting. I did a lot of research into marketing strategies and tried most of the tried and tested methods but none of them seemed to work which was another clue that my product wasn’t solving a problem for enough people. I tried content marketing and wrote a few blog posts and created some useful tools such as a mortgage calculator and managed to get some traffic to these, again it was mainly paid though. I found it difficult to find relevant sites to link back to mine and with a couple of big sites already dominating the keywords competing with SEO was really difficult. I also tried reaching out to influencers and generating some press coverage but there were very few people operating in this area and I soon realized that marketing was going to be an uphill battle or require significant investment.",0,0
56," After we launched the MVP version, we tried to grow the organic traffic on our own. We had no budget for SEM (Search Engine Marketing) or advertising, so we started with SEO (Search Engine Marketing) actions.  We built a list of startup directories and B2B app directories (like G2Crowd, Capterra, etc.) for link building. We published our site on every website on our list so that we could have some backlinks. We created a blog and we targeted some specific keywords like “review monitoring“. The results were outstanding. For some of the keywords, we reached top positions on Google.  Another tactic was to build a list with popular products like Apple products, tablets, wearables, and we created specific pages for each, presenting the customer view extracted from their reviews. For every product, we made a dedicated blog post with analytics of its reviews. This action produced some traffic, but the traffic wasn’t from our targeted customers (brands) it was from consumers interested to know more about the product they wanted to buy. This helped us to start without an advertising budget. We succeeded in creating a flow of organic traffic and even a stream of leads who came to us by our website contact form.",1,0
57," We have sorely grown through referrals and word of mouth. We have generated over $15,000 in revenue since our launch 10 months ago. When we launched, we were fortunate to get enough buzz from blogs and media outlets in Nigeria and South Africa.  We have sorely leveraged on this and built our reputation from such buzz. We also have just begun to take our SEO seriously. Blogging was a great resource for us and gradually helped us build a community but unfortunately, we had issues with our blogging platform and lost all of our contents so we had to start blogging afresh. Thanks to the amazing guys at publishnow for building an amazing blogging tool, we are now back to blogging.

58," We tried many things :)  Product Hunt launches are good for attracting investors and potential customers, but in reality, we had many registrations (1,000-2,000 every launch) but very few conversions to actual customers. Fibery is quite complex for inbound marketing channels, but we understood that only recently. One of the best things we did was this funny Yet another collaboration tool landing. It was on top of HN and generated tons of positive feedback. Many people find our humor refreshing, and it helped us get some vitality and trust.   Content marketing is something we are doing authentically as well. I write monthly progress reviews with all the numbers and all failures. Sometimes they are fun to read, and many people praise our articles. Few posts got to the HN top. We tried to collaborate with one of the best content agencies in the world, but they failed to deliver good content. On average, we have about 7-8K page views in the blog every month, and it is hard to say that numbers were growing last year. We tried CPC, and it took us 6 months to have good leads flow, but conversion is still bad. It was tough to define an activation metric for Fibery, but it seems we nailed it. We want to improve the onboarding process to improve the activation rate.  We tried to set up an outreach channel with two agencies. The first one generated zero calls, the second one is doing slightly better, and we had 3 calls last month. To make it viable, we should have around 20 calls and 5-10 sales. The experiment is still in progress. We started a Partners program a few months ago and already have 20 active partners. They truly believe in Fibery and are very enthusiastic to onboard new companies and help them with the processes set up and evolution. We don’t have any clear results from the partners yet, but I think this can be the most significant channel for Fibery in 2022. I think word of mouth is our main channel so far. Our existing customers recommend Fibery, and this is a very good sign. But since our customers’ base is not large yet, the growth is quite slow we grew from $80K to $290K ARR in 2021.",1,0
59," Most of the Financer’s success comes down to good SEO knowledge and passion. As a team, we’re all passionate about the mission of educating people to make the best financial choices and, at heart, we’re a group of SEO geeks. That means we’re always learning, discussing new strategies, perfecting old ones, and focusing on creating content that is both extremely valuable and ranks highly so that people can easily find us.

60," To start with, we focused almost exhaustively on cold outreach to both our freelancers and clients. A couple of channels such as LinkedIn, AngelList, worked well for us. However, due to the inherent limit attached to cold outreach, we started focusing on inbounds too while continually optimizing our cold outreach processes.  For inbounds, generating content related to freelancing, remote working worked well for us. During this 6 month process, we identified that the one common characteristic between most of our clients and freelancers was their inclination towards working remotely. Also, 80% of the 150+ conversations we had with this target audience suggested that choosing which tool to use for a particular use-case was their biggest challenge. Managing a remote team ourselves, held us in good stead here as we built a curated repository of 100+ remote tools across 24 categories so as to make this discovery process easier. We decided to launch on Product Hunt and were pleasantly surprised to be voted as the #2 Product of the Day. The best stat was that we landed 4 new clients via remote.tools and made 10 times the money we had invested in the product! Also, on a side note, we were able to launch the product on time and within budget :) The success of this experience showed how marketing should be more about creating value for your users rather than about your own product. Apart from such out of the box marketing initiatives, cold outreach has been reaping rich dividends for us. For the past 6 months, the split of leads from our sales and marketing efforts has been 50:50. ‍",1,0
61," For the initial year, almost all the business we got was through our network. We leveraged LinkedIn to find the right person in the companies we wanted as clients and just hustled our way to get our first 10-20 clients. I wrote about the entire process in detail in this thread.  However, soon we hit a ceiling. We recognized that our target audience was startups in the US, Europe, etc. - tech startups that wanted quality tech talent and could afford them. Given our network was ZERO outside India, we realized we had to work on growing our inbound pipeline.  We found ProductHunt to be quite useful for us. Most startups only launch their primary product on PH, but we also made many “side projects”, which we launched on PH and marketed Flexiple subtly in them. More about it here. However, it wasn’t a very reliable and stable channel. That’s when we invested heavily in SEO and that’s been a real journey. It involved: Build our “Domain authority” by writing many guest postsThen we identified keywords that had high intent. This would involve our competitor alternatives-type keywords on which we wrote focused blogs such as “Toptal alternative” which gave us many client leads.But beyond that, we made a ton of marketing pages targeting low-volume keywords but with very high conversion intent. E.g. A page for “Hire Freelance React Developers” => We would then just replace the word “React” with any other technology and duplicate the pages. Of course, we had to have enough unique content on each page to ensure we weren’t penalized by Google for duplicate content. This SEO strategy laid the foundation for our inbound growth - though it took a lot of mistakes and about a year to pay off in a big way. We have since gotten even better at SEO and have ~100k people visiting our website each month. However, one of the pleasant consequences of ensuring our customers are really happy is that a major source of revenue comes from repeat customers and customer referrals - about ~40%. In the past 4-5 months, both my co-founder and I have become more active on Twitter & LinkedIn which has also become a great channel for new leads. ",1,0
62," I simply created an excel list of all my friends and sorted out whom I can notify about us. In the end, my list was 100+ people. My two other co-founders did the same and we sent emails to all. So far, we have had 5 projects from our friends and simultaneously built our Dribbble portfolio and clutch profiles. After ending each project we made sure to showcase them both on clutch and Dribbble, which became a constant lead generation channel for us.  I tried Facebook and Instagram ads without much success. Right now, we are trying cold outreach both through cold emails and Linkedin. So far, the results are quite positive! We already had 2 projects in the second week after our launch and are growing ever since then. Currently, we can handle up to 5 projects simultaneously and support some old clients with small tasks. To grow our revenue we focused on expanding our visibility and building close relationships with new and existing clients. ‍",1,0
63," I’ve tried all kinds of things, including: Leaving comments on Harvard Business Review Articles on related topicsWriting content/guides on popular topics like 1-1 meetings.Liking and following people on Twitter based on what they were talking about Distribution is one of the most difficult things you need to think about when growing your company. What insight or advantage do you have that your competitors don’t? Many marketing channels can be competed away (like paid advertising), so ideally, you should find something that gets easier as you grow. I consistently find that the best use of my time is to talk to existing customers and improve the product so it’s more of a must-have. If I do that, people will tell their friends about it. My best piece of advice for marketing is to ask your customers/prospects a very basic question - “what resources do you visit if you’d like to learn more about [insert topic here]?  I think of customer acquisition like fishing. You need to go where the fish are. How do you know where the fish are? You ask them where they like to hang out :) We tried many experiments that failed as well. For example, at one point I paid for advertising and it was a complete waste of money. If you have even a trickle of people signing up on a regular basis, your time is best spent learning how to improve the product for those users. If you wow them, they will tell their friends. ‍",1,0
64," Beyond the articles I mentioned above, I haven’t pro-actively done a huge amount of marketing. Most of our growth has come from word-of-mouth, with people recommending Frontend Mentor to others and sharing their solutions. One thing I noticed was that some people were streaming themselves taking our challenges. In some instances, they had pretty big audiences! So over time, I’ve built great relationships with some streamers. It’s perfect because they get brilliant content that they can create for their audience, their audience learns a ton, and Frontend Mentor gets excellent publicity. So it works well for everyone! Marketing is something I’m determined to get better at, though. There will be many incredible products out there that have died due to a lack of marketing savvy.

65," Gadget Flow grew organically during the first few months and then I kind of took over its growth. As a self-taught designer, developer, marketer and experienced with running, promoting and monetizing blogs, I had hundreds of ideas on how to promote and monetize Gadget Flow. Mid-2013 I started working 15-hour days A/B testing everything that we were doing from social media posts to designs to features and functionalities. We were trying to build our product on top of our user base by getting as much feedback as possible. We partnered with other companies, did a lot of cross-promotion, giveaways, and social media marketing. We started to see traction the first month we’ve launched Gadget Flow, people were hooked with the idea of surfacing and discovering cool products every single day and that’s why we’ve been publishing 12 new products every single day since 2012.  Growing a company without any kind of funding during the recession is not easy. For the first couple years, we were pretty much doing everything with just 4-5 people in total which was really tough and exhausting but definitely worth it. Our goal was to grow Gadget Flow organically without using ads, paid listings or paid partnerships and that’s exactly what we did. We got creative and it worked! We partnered with other brands and their social media accounts in order to acquire customers, kept optimizing our copy and a/b testing our marketing messages, launched weekly giveaways, partnered with brands in order to offer exclusive discounts and deals to our users and at the same time since our numbers were growing we had lots of customers reaching out to us wanting to advertise their products and that became our primary business model after 2013.  ‍",1,0
66," First of all, I hired various writers to create a lot of content. I coded functionality so that we could easily add online games into a database and list these games based on various criteria including screenshots and play buttons with affiliate links. I was hoping that if we create enough content and did some SEO, then we would be able to get organic traffic from Google. I also reached out to various game production companies in order to cooperate and get additional exposure. This worked better than expected, but since the site was very new without a reliable track record, many companies weren’t interested in doing business with us. As always, doing business is much easier if you’re already established and successful. In addition, I started building social channels, launched various giveaways and also tried to get some additional traffic through PPC advertising.",0,0
67," Rather than marketing strategies, we leaned predominantly on an outbound sales model to acquire new customers (YouTubers and streamers) to our product. Our team was extremely effective at striking up conversations with content creators using a tried and tested playbook. We leveraged an offshore team to generate hundreds of thousands of leads and would feed them into an automated outbound contact process using Yesware. This was certainly effective insofar as acquiring influencers to our product (over 2 years, we added more than 20k to the platform), especially at the outset. It helped that our solution was innovative and first to market -- our promise was built on a way for influencers to earn easy money, who wouldn’t sign up!? In our first few months, we talked to thousands of influencers who, on the whole, saw incredible results from the product at the beginning. These results drove further growth via word of mouth -- adding hundreds of new influencers each day taking us rapidly to that $7k day in revenue.

68," Early on our growth strategies were straight hustling. I would post in Facebook groups and created a simple funnel for getting small businesses on the phone. Once I had them on the phone I knew our value prop was too good to pass and I closed the first 200 businesses doing this. The first few calls were awkward but soon I built a script and my confidence grew. I managed to close ⅓ of my calls in the first interaction. That led me to hire a salesperson while I focused on other growth channels. I knew this hack would not last us forever. As we grew we started building out our marketing machine with a heavy focus on referrals. Our product was novel enough that businesses would share it, so we created a high-quality referral program that just blew up. This felt great because referrals are highly scalable and a great indication that you have something valuable. We then layered in a marketing mix to support our referral channel and have been growing steadily since then. On the student side, we did much the same thing by finding communities of marketers that we pitched on getting work experience. When building a two-sided marketplace you have two distinct clients with different needs that you have to service. This requires a different approach for each and to add you have to grow both sides at the same pace. This added complexity was hard and required us to have to growth team for each side. We ended up following a lot of what worked on the business side for our student side along with some key partnerships that helped us grow. ‍",1,0
69," I needed to get my name out, and I could do that by making free videos and sharing them. I started tu publish every new video for free. If I were publishing lots for free, it would build up trust, and then people would learn from me, and they’d be willing to buy from me. So I started publishing a video every single week.  One day, I was out of money looking for a job and found out someone had submitted GoRails to the top of Hacker News. Y Combinator startups had used Ruby on Rails to build their products. And that was a great place for GoRails to be. That day I got +600 email addresses, and I was able to use the email addresses to send them stuff about what I was doing, new videos, and keep them up to date. The newsletter became a pretty important piece of the business. ‍",1,0
70," I leveraged my writing skills as my primary marketing strategy. I wrote so many blog posts I can’t even count them anymore. I started the company blog on Medium knowing there was a built-in audience and a better chance to get eyes on my content, but after a while, I moved the blog to a dedicated site owned by Graphite.  With content comes promotion, and I happened to already be pretty into Twitter. So, I used Twitter as my main distribution channel. But I took a different tact with Twitter than most. I chose to be genuine, both with the brand account and my personal account. I tried to avoid corporate-speak, tried to avoid making people feel like they were interacting with a robot instead of a person. What does that look like? Well, it looks like it would if you were tweeting something off the cuff on your personal account with no hidden agenda. And the truth is, that’s how I treated marketing with Graphite. I didn’t subscribe to any social media automation software, I didn’t have a spreadsheet with all my planned tweets laid out. I just did what I always did—tweet when I felt like it. The trick to this, of course, is still tweeting often. But that was never a problem for me.  The other main strategy I had was event marketing. After seeing how much traction I got off that first event in Berlin, I was convinced that attending conferences and speaking or exhibiting was the key to winning business. I managed to get a few speaking events booked where much of my travel and other costs were covered, but for everything else, I paid...a lot.  I still struggle with understanding whether event marketing worked or not. I managed to get continued media coverage of Graphite because of it, but did that coverage translate to users? I don’t know for sure, and that’s a failure of measurement on my part. I’d go so far as to say the biggest failure in marketing as a whole for Graphite was my lack of measurement. I didn’t A/B test things, wasn’t methodical in understanding the returns on the things I did. This was a product of how I was running the business and perhaps a little bit of ego.  I ran the business the way I wanted it to run, which is totally fine. But my ego told me that I didn’t need to try things that other marketers had tried and proven over the years. If I could go back, I would measure everything. I think it’s possible to do that while maintaining a genuine voice and presence.  Honestly, had I been measuring my efforts, I would have recognized patterns earlier. I would have seen that the b2b market might not have been the best bet. I can look back now and see that almost all of my engagement across blog posts and social media came from individual users. That’s an important metric to recognize and act on. But I didn’t notice it at the time. Instead, I barrelled down the b2b path without even considering an alternative.  ‍",0,0
71,"  We have done a lot. But to this day, our primary channel is organic search. We are able to show up on Google where prospects are searching for a solution like ours.  Social proof played a huge part. I remember the earlier days when it was incredibly tough because we had no logos, no case studies, no reviews. So building that all up from scratch took a long time. But now that we have some pretty decent social proof, removing that initial friction from buyers has been relieved somewhat.  The one secret to our marketing was constantly improving messaging and positioning. People would ask us what made us different from other referral software. By taking sales calls for the first year (heavily) I was able to pick up what prospects were looking for. Even though we are a self-service product with low LTV where sales don’t make sense, doing sales was crucial.  Understanding how customers spoke unlocked the language that we needed to use to sell. Now our marketing works, but only because the copy speaks to our audience. In our funnel, there are also a lot of areas we could improve in this context.  There was never really one thing that boosted traction. A combination of improving the product, updating messaging, and building up social proof is how we got to where we are today. It’s been such slow progress, but we’ve been investing more into growth recently and are ready for some faster growth. ‍",1,0
72," Upwork as a platform is kind of like a mix of LinkedIn and Instagram. They give you a long bio section to introduce yourself, state your expertise, etc. but also a ‘Portfolio’ section where you can showcase relevant work. As I started to do work for clients, I would add their campaign results into the ‘Portfolio’ section. This got amazing results, both for getting more people to contact me and also for more easily closing the sale. No longer was I just talking myself up, the results spoke for themselves. There were some clients who I would immediately get on the phone with and I would never take about myself once. They’d tell me about their business and then ask my rate right away. It was an amazing feeling, to say the least. Additionally, I also began to see referrals start to trickle in. Business owners would tell their friends/family who also had businesses and I had a few clients come in that way. To date, I have never landed a client from cold calling/cold emailing, but I’m much happier with my current system, as well as the one I’m building through partnerships. Essentially, the strategy is to find businesses or personalities who have audiences I think would be a good fit (the marketing industry, mainly) and providing some sort of content for them. This could be in the form of a guest post on their blog, being on their podcast, doing a live workshop/webinar with them, etc. I only just started this system in late December and so far it is has been going great. ‍",1,0
73," The first two weeks after we launched we did absolutely zero promotion. We focused exclusively on 1:1 outreach to get more mentors onboard, targeting growth people we personally admired and that we believed had the right ethos fit. Once we had around 30 mentors, we decided to tippy toe into the limelight a little more. Our first “public” appearance came via a post on the SaaS Growth Hacks Facebook group where I told the story of the platform and asked if people resonated with it. I was blown away by the positive response. We must have got more than 100 signups from that single post.  Since we’re bootstrapped, we exhausted all free marketing channels first. That meant mingling in niche communities like IndieHackers, GrowthHackers and a variety of Slack channels. This was a go-go-go time period where we didn’t get to sleep that much. LinkedIn worked really well too. I’m not really a big social media user but I knew that if I was going to play the role of a founder of a marketing platform, I had to up my game. We also did a lot of blog posting writing dozens of blog posts those first few months. A few of those posts are starting to rank for some pretty serious keywords, but as we all know, SEO is a long game. My biggest regret is that I didn’t promote those early posts enough. It was one of those cases where I “knew” I should do it and I even made a pretty sweet checklist for it, but I just ran out of steam...  We spread ourselves way too thin those early days. I should have delegated the promotion to my VA instead of all the list building I had them do. At one point I went on a massive targeted scraping campaign with the big picture to send out semi-personalized (at scale) email drips to drum up demand. I only ended up using like 2 or 3 of those lists. It takes a lot of time to do outreach at scale properly, and if you’re managing operations, creating content, and also juggling a day job, it’s like the first thing to cut from the “to-do” list. Anything done at scale carries the potential risk to tarnish your brand if executed improperly.  Doing things that didn’t scale like cultivating 1:1 friendships with the mentors and mentees was our most successful marketing strategy. Unlike other B2C 2-sided marketplaces like Airbnb where the supply side is just normal people trying to make some side cash, our supply was bad-ass growth marketers that legit wanted to help people grow. Many of them are deeply entrenched in the startup scene with huge networks. So leveraging their networks was kind of a no-brainer for us. We didn’t want to create a “marketplace,” we wanted this to be a community.  We started with private Facebook groups, one for the mentors first, then a few months later, one just for the mentees. It turned out to be a great place we could ask for feedback from super smart growth peeps, share our progress, and where members could network with each other.  ‍",1,0
74," The team and bar owners were happy that the app had worked for a few people, but it definitely was not the explosive launch we were hoping for. On the bright side, the people who did use it had a smooth experience. We learned from this that “if you build it they will come” is generally not true. So we implemented a few strategies to market our app: We ran a follow/unfollow twitter bot on our account targeting everyone who followed the accounts of the major bars in our college town. Twitter is where everyone found out about drink specials.  A couple of student journalists heard about us, asked to interview us, then published our interviews with links to download our app.  We went to fraternities and sororities at dinner time. At our school, it was common for people to drop by and pitch in one minute their event or org. We went and pitched our app and left flyers. We worked out deals with one of our partner bars so that people who paid cover with our app would get crazy good drink deals. We had to pay the difference in the drink price, but we only further discounted already good deals ($3 pitchers -> $1 pitchers). This created lines around the block. We ‘hired’ unpaid interns to hand out flyers in front of the bars. We were getting users for about $1/each blended. In one month, we acquired 2,500 users - about 25% of the bar-going crowd. We even had some haters (which typically means you’re doing something right). ",0,0
75," Since we never got any customers, I’ll go over some of the strategies we attempted. 1) Cold Emailing - The most effective strategy for us to get at least a response was direct outreach. This was mostly a simple response back such as a hello or offering their own service. Plenty of gym owners have a website and their contact information was present on the site. We simply pitched our ideas to owners via email. Another thing we did was message gym owners through contact forms on their website. That also got us a few responses! 2) Social Media - Using Twitter’s search feature, we searched for terms such as “where to find a gym” and “find gyms in <area>”. The idea behind using Twitter was to help users by responding to their tweets. Plenty of people tweet asking for help but sometimes no one responds to their tweets. We saw that as an opportunity to get the attention of someone who might be interested in checkout out Gymlisted. Our Twitter account is still available online for posterity’s sake! 3) Offering a tangential service for free - In addition to the cold emailing and direct outreach, we decided that to get the attention of gym owners, we could offer a free service. So, I decided to buy a 360 Camera and offer free 360 photos and videos to the gym owners so they could use it on Gymlisted and anywhere else online. A few gyms bit, but overall it wasn’t a popular option. ‍",0,0
76," There is no absolute answer for this. I think our app grows from the trial and error of many marketing strategies, including both traditional and unconventional growth hack tactics. One of the first solutions to the sluggish revenue stream was to localize the app and expand it to more markets. Then, we launched Habitify on Product Hunt to gain some traction. There we go, the first purchase after 6 months. The first month of salary for everyone in the team.  Then everything changed when Apple featured us. It was a big hit. Millions of impressions turned into thousands of downloads each day. People started to notice our indie app, and spread the words around. News wrote about us. Apple featured us again. We reached 500,000 downloads in 2 years, and in the next few months from now, it will be 1 million.  On our journey from that critical moment of Apple naming Habitify as New App We Love, we tried a lot of things: from Facebook ads campaign, Instagram story ads campaign and lots of give-away, referral, special campaigns throughout the seasons... Now, the marketing strategies that truly work for us were a strong focus on content marketing and affiliate marketing. One-off events like Product Hunt launches or advertisements were not worth our effort and are incredibly expensive.  We haven’t grown our revenue significantly from our marketing strategies, but we know we’re on the right path. The LTV of traffic coming from our content campaigns far exceeds that from other campaigns, which is a positive signal. So for 2020, content marketing will be one of our key focuses to grow the app in a sustainable way. We are committed to bring not only the best app on the market, but also a blog that delivers the most in-depth articles on habit tracking and goal setting. ",1,0
77," This is basically where I fell short. Like so many other programmers who do a side-project, I never really gave too much thought into how I’d get the word out there. I think many programmers are under the assumption that if the product is good, it’ll spread by itself. That’s just not the case. The biggest thing I did marketing-wise was posting the app on Product Hunt, where it got a semi-good reception. Partly because I posted it on a Sunday, which doesn’t seem to be the day people are thinking about optimizing their lives, and partly because Product Hunt has been overflowed with different habit trackers.  After launching on Product Hunt, I didn’t really have much of a marketing strategy, so the app was kind of left dead in the water from there. ‍",0,0
78," We were lucky enough to get accepted into the NZ Vodafone Xone accelerator. As part of this, we received some pretty good press coverage, resulting in a constant stream of inquiries through our landing page. We also posted in a bunch of farming groups on Facebook. The inquiries we received gave us a strong indication that this was something farmers wanted. Some of these became early test cases and would send us data to help train our model. ‍",0,0
79," My marketing capabilities were limited back then. I didn't know about AD campaigns or Search Engine Optimization. I thought I just had to create the website and it would be shown on Google on its own. After some research, I decided that the best strategy was to reach rank #1 on Google in a few keywords I found related to my service. My developers offered me SEO monthly services, so I accepted and started paying them for it. As their link and ranking reports came, I started to better understand the world of SEO and I started doing my own SEO as well. I would search for these keywords, and try to create similar articles or topics to those which were on the first page. These tactics, along with SEO done by the developers, finally put me rank 1 on 3 different keywords. I was so happy that I hired my developer again to create an Android app with the same features as my website by the end of 2015, not knowing the failure that was just a bit ahead of me.",0,0
80," I would say that our most successful strategy was to invest heavily in Facebook and Instagram and partner with influencers who look attractive wearing our sunglasses. Word-of-mouth advertising has allowed us to expand our business to three continents, something that brings all of us great pride. The focus on fashion versus functionality has also been instrumental. Hawkers conducts most transactions online to cut down on overhead costs associated with brick-and-mortar locations. ",1,0
81," Believe it or not, I didn’t put much towards the marketing budget. I took a grassroots approach, which in the political world it would equate to being the bible of marketing approaches. The little marketing that I did was through networking events and constantly selling myself, including providing high-quality work with the client I already had. In a sense, it was working quite well since I had a niche market. I soon found myself in conversation with two other NFL players to develop their foundations whom I met at the Super Bowl during that time.  The two contracts that I had coming down the pipeline were between $3500 - $6000 per month, of course with different time frames. I’d say things were going well until I woke up and saw a heart-aching reality was heading my way fast. ‍ ‍",0,0
82," Version 2 was finished in December 2020. While building it, I would drop the occasional teaser on Twitter on how powerful the new tool was. So, when I launched in December, the growth and hype were out of this world. Revenue would double every few weeks. I started December with $1K MRR and reached $20K MRR in February 2021. Most growth happened organically. I’m part of the “build in public” group on Twitter that shares all learnings, numbers, and progress. Lots of these tweets would go viral. This caused a flywheel effect. Bigger accounts would see the tweets on their timeline and learn about Headlime, which got me featured on Techcrunch. The tool also felt like magic, not only for me but for everyone who used it. It solved a big problem for a lot of people. Copywriting is hard. Getting creative ideas is even more challenging. Imagine paying $29 (or eventually $59) a month for a tool that can do all your copywriting for you — a no-brainer purchase. ",1,0
83,"  We’ve grown through long-lasting relationships, partnerships, referrals, and word of mouth as most service-based businesses.   We’ve been starting to put concerted effort and investment into things that attract customers and also things that can help us identify and reach out to them.  When we started Headway, we didn’t leave our full-time jobs and focus on it until we could sell our first customer on a product team coming alongside them. It consisted of 3 engineers and 1 product designer/strategist.  We’ve grown our revenue through increasing rates and starting to niche down from anyone who can use our services to particular offerings. We haven’t figured it all out, and we are constantly experimenting. ",1,0
84," At SaaS Labs, as we build and launch so many products on a regular basis, we have a playbook for our product launches. I’m going to share that here with everyone.  Product Hunt Launch: If you launch your product at the right time (around 12-1230am PST), with great images and an engaging first comment - there are high chances of getting featured on the first page, obviously if the product is good. This will generate 1000s of visits. Now, it’s on you how you make most of it. SEO: We start working on important keywords almost 2 months before the launch. We do a lot of offsite and onsite SEO to make it to the first 3 results for important terms.Cold outreach to Linkedin contacts, customers of other products.Paid Ads: It is good to have a working paid channel that is at least generating clicks with high CTR. This means that there is a legit demand for the product and you can scale.Integrations with other tools and getting listed on market places.   All in all, we signed up over 1700-2000 folks in a short time. And, 55 converted to a paid subscription within weeks of launch.  SEO & Integrations worked the best. Paid ds did a good job & Product Hunt didn’t get us many customers but definitely helped us pick the momentum.  We’re growing organically at a healthy rate month on month.",1,0
85," We don't have a big problem in terms of student acquisition, because it's 100% digital and is zero upfront cost, making it very easy and tempting to apply. Once the first students began to get jobs, they started spreading the word. Nowadays, a lot of people that comes into Henry is because a friend or family member has already passed through our program and has had success. Unfortunately, we can't accept everyone because our resources are limited. That’s getting more difficult every month as we have more applicants. I think that the net impact of COVID-19 on Henry has been positive. Despite some companies (for example those in the travel industry) have stopped hiring software engineers, many others have kept hiring as they have had to digitize their operations or because they weren’t affected by the pandemic at all. Also, we teach people 100% remotely so students have been able to keep learning why staying in their homes.",1,0
86," We simply created a website with a friend and started to resell domains and hosting packages. We invested a lot of our time in SEO and for some time we were placed on the first page in Google (for Slovenian language).  We already had the knowledge of building an online store and this wasn’t that far from it. We planned our content carefully for SEO reasons and soon our daily visits were quite good. We didn’t do a lot of marketing as that wasn’t that popular back then and we didn’t have a lot of knowledge about. Our focus was mainly Google and at the start the revenue was decent. We also created a Facebook page and a Twitter account but I had no idea how to promote the business well across the social platforms. So besides learning a few things, it was more or less a loss of time.",0,0
87," We started out on Facebook and Instagram, with Instagram being 90% of our efforts. We grew our Instagram account to about 500 followers in the first few weeks. We did run a few promotions but didn’t have much success with those as we didn’t have the capital required to compete on a large enough scale. We focused on Instagram, because of its amazing potential to reach an audience organically. 85% of our sales came from organic Instagram. I actually have written an article on how to use Instagram organically, and this is everything I did and followed with Howell Market. If I had to go back and redo this, I would have also included Pinterest in our marketing efforts. Pinterest, I think, is one of the most underutilized marketing platforms of today. Pinterest drives traffic and can easily be put on auto-pilot. I was probably spending close to 2-4 hours a day on Instagram trying to grow our account, and on an average Pinterest account I spend about 2-4 hours a week and get way better results!",0,0
88," When we launched, we had a lot of encouraging words from the local tech community with regards to the simplicity of the platform and from the filmmaking community with regards to the quality of short films. We were very proud of ourselves. To market the platform, we knew it was best to grow organically and so we were looking for ways to achieve this. We decided to try blogging, writing and profiling about Africa’s Young Talented Filmmakers, news on festivals, etc. This turned out to be very successful. We started seeing our traffic grow gradually. In a few months, we were seeing an average of 1000 views on some of our short films. Now, I know 1000 views look really small compared to other kinds of contents on other video platforms but from experience, we have learned that a short film that gets even as low as 500 views is commendable.  Our main marketing strategy was blogging mostly. Attending and sponsoring award categories at film festivals in Cameroun and Nigeria. ‍",0,0
89," Since launching your product, what have you done to grow Hubstaff? Since launching Hubstaff five years ago, we’ve been working hard to make our product the best it can possibly be. We’ve built a skilled and knowledgeable customer support team that listens to customer feedback which gives us the opportunity to create a product that meets our customer’s needs. Hiring the right people for our team has also been key when it comes to growing our company, we take time to hire people that are extremely knowledgeable in their area of expertise and once we hire them on there is a detailed onboarding process they must go through. Having a team that knows what they are doing is key to a successful business and we credit our strong team for the growth Hubstaff has seen. Branding has also been very important when it comes to growing our company, it has helped guide us in our decision-making process and we continue to refine it as we grow. ‍ What tactics worked? SEO, word of mouth and content were the top three tactics that worked for us. Content and SEO go hand-in-hand and we knew early on that a blog would be beneficial to getting our name out there. We produced regular content and made sure it was keyword based. We wrote about topics like time tracking, outsourcing, and screenshots which helped lead customers to our website. Word of mouth was also beneficial when it came to obtaining new clients. People that were led to us through the blog were telling others about us which really helped us grow. ‍ How did you employ/approach these tactics? We knew that hiring employees who were specialists in these areas was key when it came to pursuing growth. We never rushed in to hiring someone but rather took the time to find the right person for the job. It was important to us (and still is) that we find people who are experts in a specific area.   What didn't work? One tactic that didn’t work for us is paid advertising, it never really worked and I don’t know why - I wish I did.   When did you start to see traction? How did that feel? We started seeing traction from our free program almost immediately which felt awesome. Seeing such positive feedback so early on was the motivation behind sticking with the work of building. ‍ Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous? Word of mouth has been particularly advantageous for us. The biggest thing is that people love the product and appreciate the way we do business, if they’re happy with that they’ll spread the word. ‍",1,0
90," My strategy for Hyperstarter was different than all the other businesses I worked on. I didn’t want to spend time boasting about how great we are or the same self-promoting BS you hear from every other marketer. I wanted direct traceable references and get others to write about how great we were. To find customers, I joined different crowdfunding forums and offered my advice to campaign owners for free. They saw what I wrote, got in touch and I initially lowered my prices to get involved in these projects just to gain some experience. Compared to my competitors I wanted customers to know that we at Hyperstarter are approachable and trustworthy. Sure, collecting money is great but we wanted to provide real value and we care about our clients, our references reflect that. Within the space of 2 years, we’ve been instrumental in the success of the British Invention of the Year, Virgin Voom Runner-up to the nearly $900,000 raised Neck Hammock. I’d say 95% of our business comes from referrals and messages from our site. The rest of our business comes from direct tweets or emails to campaign owners based on similar successful campaigns we worked on (whilst showing them the references at the same time). This tactic works very well and we have a great reputation on forums, Trustpilot, and our website. One of the advantages I’d say Hyperstarter has over others is that we work closely with our clients, but we’ve also connected with our closest competitors too. I think Hyperstarter is part of a small inner circle of crowdfunding companies that in some ways can work together on a campaign, as we all bring our own unique set of skills to the table. ‍",1,0
91," Since the very beginning, our aim is to build and improve our brand value and recognition. As stated earlier, we aggressively promoted our services through Craigslist ads and other free business directories at the start.  We would also reach out to hundreds of people every day through emails, and as time went one, we started getting some qualified leads that lead to clients. Those were the leads that helped us kick-start and essentially grow our business.  We would brainstorm and figure out ways to provide value to all the leads in order to grow our portfolio, clientele, and trust and credibility in this over-saturated market.  We also attended many local events in Raleigh, Cary, Charlotte, and Durham to connect with potential leads and prospects. Reaching out to local businesses digitally and in-person helped us build momentum, give us a face, and build a presence around our local area.  When we had a handful of projects after the first six months, we decided to drastically enhance our website and start marketing it across North Carolina. We developed our website, setup the social channels, and started posting helpful and insightful blogs every week, and socializing them.  Our primary focus was building an SEO-optimized website that would help us establish a valuable and credible online presence. I used to research, read, and chat for several hours with my friends and online marketing experts, trying to understand SEO, PPC, content marketing, social media ads, and whatnot. I have also spent countless hours learning Google algorithms, Google trends, and analyzing top service providers and competitors in our domain.  The learning and analysis allowed us to create SEO-friendly content for our website and improve competitive Google rankings organically over time. Eventually, with our combined SEO strategies, our website began ranking on the top of Google in North Carolina and even nationwide for many competitive keywords. This generated thousands of unique visitors per month to the website, which translated into leads, and eventually clients. Over the past eight years, we have generated our leads and clients from the following marketing and sales channels (%): Google Organic (SEO) - ~80%Referrals and account management - ~10%Strategic Partnerships - ~2%Events/Networking - ~3%Paid Advertising - ~2%Social Media - ~3% Being an entrepreneur is not easy. You have to make a lot of sacrifices and fight your way through some of the toughest obstacles in order to see your business flourish. We didn't know much about entrepreneurship when we started, but we learned things through tons of trial and error and consistent hard work. ",1,0
92," IMPOSSIBLE Over the years with IMPOSSIBLE, I have done hundreds of interviews, guest blogs, and podcast interviews. The primary way that I’ve grown has been acting like a human to other people and trying to help their businesses. We’ve seen tremendous growth through organic channels like SEO, but a HUGE portion of the impossible audience comes organically via social and through things like the impossible list - which we’ve had thousands of people go on to create their own. We’re continuing to invest in “sticky” marketing that grabs people’s attention and inspires them to push their limits - specifically with video + photos.  MoveWell MoveWell primarily grew from my existing IMPOSSIBLE email list. Over time, it’s garnered its own small cult following in the recovery space and we’re continuing to push on that as we create more and more useful content. Our organic marketing has started to take off recently with some posts like our mewing and stretches databases doing very well.  Ultimate Meal Plans + Ultimate Paleo Guide These businesses sort of grew on their own. At first, I thought they would be a very similar audience as IMPOSSIBLE - but their demographics skew very differently. It turns out most of our traffic is organic - either through search or social and skew heavily female.  Our meal planning app has become quite the standout lately and we’re going to be rolling out an affiliate program to help us scale up even faster soon. ‍",1,0
93," We didn’t ever have a very coherent marketing strategy. One of the things I tell the non-technical founders we work with these days is that having at least one non-technical founder is actually super important. We were all technical founders - the original team was two developers and one designer. So, we really knew nothing about marketing. We would get heads down working on the product, and then go, “oh right, we need to tell people about this.” Most of our users came from a successful Product Hunt launch, which is a completely unsustainable approach. We had a moderate bit of success with content marketing, but we just never stuck to it consistently enough to build a really strong audience. For current founders, technical or non-technical, find a channel that’s sort of working and stick to it with unrelenting focus. You should be spending at least 50% of your time on sales and marketing - and you need that unrelenting focus because consistency in marketing is key. ‍",0,0
94," Through my position as a student manager for the USC football team, I was able to speak with multiple student athletes about what NIL meant to them and how we could develop the most convenient solution possible. Additionally, it helped that most of these guys were my good friends since I had spent time with them almost every day for 3-4 months. So being able to get honest, authentic feedback was super crucial to the success of our product. The value proposition is straightforward: We guide athletes throughout the process and help them make money from their NIL, all for free. So it didn’t take too much convincing for them. Approaching brands was a bit harder to do. Still, we ended up having over 40+ conversations with social media and influencer managers to investigate the influencer industry and how we can provide additional value in a fast-growing sector. Before completing the brands’ web app, we already have 5 brands that want to work with us and sponsor athletes on our marketplace once the web app is complete. ‍",1,0
95," You name it, I've tried it. I had early success with SEO and so for a number of years I spent all my effort on that. SEO has the huge amounts of traffic for a B2C site, but of course you spend a lot of your time working to improve the site for search engines rather than users. I have also tried giveaways (nope), affiliates (ok, but doesn't move the needle), Twitter (too much all over the place), Adwords (too expensive) and traditional PR companies (no noticeable effect). ‍ How did you employ/approach these tactics? SEO is great for bringing in traffic, and also allows you to target the right ""sort"" of traffic. You can target search terms that are close to the purchasing section of the funnel. Facebook is great for the targeting ability and for the cost (vs Adwords which allows you to do similar targeting but is much more expensive). ‍ What didn't work? Why? Traditional PR. I spent several thousand on a PR firm. They got a few mentions in newspapers, but didn't have any boost in traffic (or anything) that we noticed. Google Adwords. This is a killing zone for travel searches. The bid prices have been pushed so high by companies like Expedia, Booking and Kayak that I have found it impossible to make money through Adwords. ‍ When did you start to see traction? How did that feel? The site puttered along for a few years as a side project. It wasn't until my main site (sudoku.com.au) started to decline that I decided to invest more time into iwantthatflight.com.au and actually see if it could become something (through SEO). Luckily, this was back in around 2006 so there were 2 things going for me: The Australian travel space wasn't very crowded. The existing big businesses were only just starting to notice the web and competition from overseas companies was non-existent.SEO was much, much easier back then. Once traffic started to pick up the main feeling was relief, actually. I had been running my own business for a number of years, but was only a few months away from being forced to go back to work. ‍ Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous? Being able to code. Online small business owners who cannot code are forced to either use offshore agencies to save money or spend more and use a local coder. Offshore coders save you money but require you to have much better documentation/specifications, quality is extremely variable and timelines are usually much longer. Going local improves those areas but is usually much more expensive. I know several owners that wait months for even relatively small updates. Learn to code.",1,0
96," In order to launch Jobridge, we used bulk SMS, newspaper and hoardings for brand awareness. Bulk SMS helped us reach job seekers in bulk but hoardings and newspaper had little or no effect on industries. These had to be approached personally. It took a lot of hit and trial using the above three methods to build an advertising and marketing promotion strategy. But they were our main attraction channels. To reach employers, we used cold calling and door to door marketing with the help of our sales guy. One strategy that worked pretty well to get job postings on our portal was looking at job postings advertised in newspapers and calling the employers to explain our business model. It took us some time to get them onboard and there were times in which we had to give them free vacancies to build a relationship with them. But with time, the flow of job postings got better. And one strategy that worked well to get premium job seekers membership, was bulk SMS and word of mouth. Our premium services and costs were reasonable so the word quickly spread. ‍",0,0
97," Because the launch was so successful I had a few vendors contacting me to buy my cards at wholesale. And Kickstarter was a link to my new Shopify store so it was pretty seamless keeping the party going. In all, the Kickstarter was much more successful than $92,000 if the next 30-60 days were included. And we never spent more than $400 on marketing and ads (I probably should have). But no party lasts forever. I’d say the next 12 months were still pretty easy. But sales started to slow down I had to find ways to keep selling cards and do my own marketing. I tried Reddit ads, Google SEO, Google ads, StumbleUpon, Instagram, and a few small ad agencies. Facebook ads offered the best ROI. And quick videos 15-30 seconds had the most impact. I tried static images but I never saw many conversions. Part of my growth strategy was to continue to launch new categories on Kickstarter and rely on my Kickstarter community. This has worked pretty well. I launched a device called the Cricket and raised $15,000. I struggled to sell it after Kickstarter. I was sitting on inventory and nothing was moving, maybe 1-3 units a day. I decided to make new videos and show how I used the cricket these videos transformed my sales into selling 30-50 units a day without changing my ad spend from before. My lesson show the customer how to use the product in their life, don’t tell them features. Example 1: How Card Works in Water Example 2: First Cricket Video That Spiked Sales ‍",1,0
98," From the very start, I tested the concept with a small group of marketers, then expanded it as my consulting work grew. I would sketch out different functionalities and features I wanted to build until I got feedback from people that they would pay for such a product. Then I had people pay me for the software before I built it. That really motivated me to stay on track and deliver a minimum viable product that was still valuable. The distance between then and now seems light years away but remaining focused on my mission to teach other marketers how to do their own PR really kept things attainable. I wasn’t distracted by the more traditional features that I could have built to keep a small number of customers happy - there are plenty of tools out there to send bulk pitches or manage list building and segmentation. These details wouldn’t get the little guys on the map. So I worked on creating PR search tools that could be easily adopted by someone looking to increase brand awareness and run a more agile PR campaign. If you’re in marketing and you never had a chance to sink your teeth into a holistic strategy that incorporates PR with your typically siloed content and SEO strategies, PR will continue to be the element that can boost your overall marketing efforts. So many people assume PR is a skill set they don’t want to acquire or think they don’t have time for. My first approach in the marketing I’ve done has been to educate people, to show them they’re capable of learning how to do their own PR.  We’ve just launched a new offering that is a pure product. After baking our strategy and tactics into the platform in the form of a PR Program and releasing some new features for getting press, we’re seeing a clear picture of the most successful customers. These are people working in industries very similar to past successful customers only now we can identify them as future successful customers early on and provide them with the right guidance before they even become a customer. We know that customers who have a content marketer on their team will have a shorter distance from onboarding to seeing results. We also know that customers who have proprietary data that translates into a story of impact or provides insights into an existing buzzworthy news topic will be able to more easily find journalists interested in hearing more.   ",1,0
99," We’re just starting to grow this particular “prosumer” business so our marketing strategy is very much a WIP. To begin with, we are prioritizing paying customers, so people have the opportunity to become Supporters and pay to use Kamua right now. That’s a bit of exclusivity - kind of like Superhuman does - and it’s really because we want customers who are willing to invest the time and effort to learn how to use Kamua properly. Steve Jobs famously said, paraphrasing here, that the computer is a bicycle for the mind. We think Kamua is a Lime Scooter for creativity. When things get steep, you just keep pressing the lever and up you go. We had a period of open Alpha access last year but what happened was we got a lot of people in who were purely curious. They didn’t need to edit video or work faster, they didn’t invest the time to learn how it works, so they ended up just distracting us from our mission. We don’t offer free stock footage or free audio files or free templates. If you don’t have existing video to repurpose, you’re not going to really get the most out of Kamua. So right now we’re marketing only to people who need to repurpose video for a living and we want to save them time. One of our customers went from managing a 16 hour end to end process to doing it himself in Kamua in 15 minutes. It sounds like a made-up story but it’s real. Between exchanging Excel files and screenshots and all of the stuff that 2 teams in 2 different companies used to do, the customer now grabs the videos he needs from his client’s YouTube channel, mashes together and crops the video to the social media format he needs, and sends it to them for concept approval. Fifteen minutes end to end.  And he gets them three videos instead of just one. So if we really wanted to boast we’d say “48 hours to 15 minutes” but the reason we don’t say that is because the extra two videos the customer produces are the added value to his client, and the time savings are the added value for him and his colleagues. That’s a force multiplier. They can A/B test now, whereas before with the time and budget constraints they could not. Another great use case from a different person at that same customer that she just made us aware of this morning. Because of Covid-19, she is working from her parents’ place in the mountains where there is only a 3G connection. She works exclusively in Kamua and only uses files that are already available in the cloud, no uploading or downloading. Without Kamua, she would not be able to work because nobody else can take care of her parents and in the time of Covid, this is increasingly a common scenario that people are working remote on less than ideal connection speeds. So that made us believe there are hundreds of thousands of people like that customer all over the world and we are in the process of finding them. Revenue is just starting out. That particular B2B customer is on an annual pre-paid contract at $700/year per user. We have higher tiers and also entry-level tiers for Supporters, as low as $21/month right now with an annual subscription. Some of our growth strategies include making tutorials that we post on YouTube and Reddit, that help people with competitor software, like Adobe. We think it’s restrictive to just post tutorials on how to use your own product when your target audience is facing problems using other legacy software, and your current software doesn’t solve all of their problems. They see the Kamua brand, they associate us with solving problems for creative people and some of them will be curious enough to see what we offer. It’s a slow-burn piece of the strategy, but it does work. We are getting hundreds of new subscribers to our various social channels every month this way, and we just started. ‍",1,0
100," I think Crowdfunding campaigns are fantastic for games. The people that donate become evangelists of the project, love being involved and share actively with people. We also had a very active feedback channel in a public forum, where we were the only official Server that responded to user inquiries. That gave us a huge influx of users and feedback. We had over 300 special account users, some of which individually contributed over 100U$S each. This was significant for the space because we didn’t yet offer a superior product, but the promise of one. (A funny story is that a user donated 100U$S with bitcoin at the time, which was around 3 dollars each. We sold the bitcoins when it hit 60U$S, thinking we hit the jackpot!) The most difficult part of growing a new Go server is the chicken-egg problem: it’s a market place between players of different strengths, and if you don’t have enough players you don’t get enough players. We attacked this problem in many ways: we organized prized tournaments, we added passive activities that engaged users for longer periods and would mean more presence. One of our most effective tools was to add bots that made it so a large number of players could play even if they found no (human) opponents. We used to have about 100 people online constantly, and we had 10’s of thousands of registered users. The number of games played was well over 10.000.  ‍",0,0
101," After launching Kimp, we’ve relied on a combination of social media marketing, affiliate marketing, referral marketing, and Google Ads in particular. We’ve found each of these methods to be fairly effective so far, with the caveat that at times social media marketing can be a bit tricky/unpredictable as algorithms shift. Apart from these different marketing channels, we’ve also been very particular about our messaging and copy. We try to ensure that we’re always highlighting the aspects of our service that are unique to others in the subscription-based design space. ‍",1,0
102," We, of course, did not get to a point beyond the idea stage with KnowNet, so we never got a chance to grow the business. Our initial plan was to reach out to nearby students through our contacts in the area, but before we could do that, we in fact needed tutors who were willing to participate (having the supply ahead of time before meeting demand), which was a fact that we didn’t appreciate at the time. In fact, with Ridj-it, the analogy was to actively pursue and market to drivers to ensure they were available to provide rides. Also, to reach students, we were aware that we had to market to their parents or caretakers, and so our marketing strategy would’ve included targeted mail campaigns to residences near schools, for example, or advertised to well-known blogs devoted to parenting (i.e., mommy blogs) and education. As a way to bring in tutors, we considered the prospect of offering tutoring companies a devoted place on the platform, as a marketplace for them to cast a wider net and get newer clients.",0,0
103," We didn’t ‘go to market’ so we used 2 main methods of acquiring leads prior to launching on crowdfunding. Facebook ads and PR. We sucked hard at ads as it’s complicated and successful Facebook campaigns require enough budget for testing (which we didn’t have).  We were relatively good at PR (and something I used once KOLOS failed to get my first clients). P.S. my Paint skills were that good though: And since we were out of money, we were using some ‘creative’ growth hacking techniques like looking through Facebook groups of iPad gamers and sending them friend requests, then ‘pitching’ them KOLOS.  Eventually we had an email list of less than 500 people which was way below what was needed for an even remotely successful launch on Kickstarter. The conversion rates on the page were also pretty bad which was the main factor that contributed to the failure.  Post-factum we found out people just don’t care about the problems we made-u… ehm, were ‘solving’ with the wheel.  ",0,0
104," I knew that marketing was absolutely essential to grow Kopely. From December 2019 to March 2020 I was doing everything I could to start pre-selling the Kopely free-trial app and onboard as many new customers as possible. I was spending every minute I could outside of my other obligations to stir up interest on online forums, attack specific keywords with SEO, run Facebook ads, and connect with health and wellness media sites for potential product launch coverage.  After 2 months of hard work, I started to gain traction. My SEO efforts were paying off. We saw an increase of organic traffic and conversion of new subscribers, my Facebook ADs started to bring in a steady stream of new subscribers and I just started to connect with health and wellness bloggers and media outlets. My marketing efforts really started to kick in and then the COVID-19 pandemic happened.  ",0,0
105," A solid content marketing strategy and then Google Adwords. Facebook Ads are very helpful too, but what really made a difference for us was creating highly converting landing pages and then using Google Adwords to promote our content. Also, we have always been very flexible in our strategy, discarding what didn’t work and doubling down on what did work. Another important aspect of our marketing strategy was to establish partnerships. Building a network of partners of the same industry helped us reach great visibility and get traffic at scale. Last but not least, the Intercom Sales Chat. I know that many people still look at it as a simple helpdesk tool. But it’s much more than that. It’s what allowed our sales managers to make visitors comfortable to talk with us, book demos to discover our products and ultimately becoming new customers. ‍",1,0
106," For the initial user base, I attracted them organically through my own network. I’d tell friends about what I was working on, and they’d tell other friends who they thought might be interested. I’d grow the email list as best I could, and try to send out interviews & pieces of wisdom I’d score from top-notch executives that I knew people would want to read about. These executives were previous mentors, fathers of friends, and really random people I’d meet through warm introductions who were attracted to the concept.",0,0
107," By far the most effective marketing strategy we employ is on-the-ground sampling and education. We certainly see a positive uptick from our work with micro-influencers, implementation of paid social ads, etc, but consumers are increasingly aware and averse to advertisements in their feeds.  With a new and unique product like Leilo, it’s hard to convey our entire value proposition in a 10-second video on Instagram. Consumers need to try our flavors, feel Leilo’s effects, and learn about our story from the people who built the company. While we continue to advertise digitally, we’ve allocated an increasing amount of our marketing spend towards person-to-person interaction, with in-store demos, pop-ups throughout our key markets, and event sponsorships, to give consumers a more holistic relaxation experience.  At the end of the day, it’s not the number of followers on social platforms that carries you, but rather the loyal customer base you cultivate who will consistently pick your product up off the shelves. While I understand the urge to focus heavily on e-commerce and social media capital, you can’t forget about the human element of marketing and growth.  ",1,0
108," Once the tool was built, my goal was to acquire users without spending any money. So I went with four channels: The first was cold outreach. How could we promote lemlist, a cold email tool, without using cold emails? I reached out to many potential buyers and they liked it, especially the personalization.The second one was communities. A great win was when I shared a screenshot of the beta product in a group of people sending cold emails and I received a ton of comments from people who were interested in trying it. However, a competitor who was in the group too announced they were launching a similar personalization feature to ours, so we started running to launch it first.The third was Product Hunt. We ended up on the #1 position of the day as people loved the idea behind it. But, it was hard to retain the users after that.The fourth was AppSumo. This is a platform where tools like lemlist offer access in a life-time way and for a super reduced price. In two weeks, we made $160,000 in revenue, selling thousands of licenses. Those were two exhausting weeks, where I answered tons of customer support messages, slept little, then woke up in the middle of the night just to answer some more, then back to bed, etc. From those $160k, we ended up with just $60k. But it was a great way to get a lot of traction and word-of-mouth rolling. We were also able to get a lot of feedback from users and money to invest back in the product. Being honest, AppSumo is worth it if your business is targeting SMBs, startups, agencies or business owners. And no, these people won’t upgrade to better plans afterward. But it’s a perfect way to get some funding and learn from customers. We’ve also tried out referral marketing in the past but ended up having problems. Initially, it was doing well, but then, during a holiday in Sri Lanka, I used Google to see how things were going just to find an affiliate member doing Adwords for that keyword. Digging into it, I found some partners were bidding on our name and stole our organic traffic. As our revenue share was pretty high, there were people making money doing simple AdWords campaigns. That’s when we decided to turn it off. As for ads, we haven’t done much. Customer acquisition costs on Facebook resulted to be quite cheap, but it wasn’t very accurate. We decided we wanted to keep it small, focus on the product, and maybe in the future, go on with Facebook & Google Ads. Retention, which was quite a problem at first, was great later on. The intention was to educate users as much as possible and avoid having people join without actually using the product. We’re currently at $1,000,000 in ARR. Between June 2019 and December 2019, we’ve generated huge growth, much faster than before. I think I’d attribute that to the compound effect, as we have been growing x%/month quite steadily. ",1,0
109," I’m not good at social media, I’m not aggressively promoting my newsletter, and I’m not paying for advertisement. Optimizing my content for both search engines and visitors still works quite well. Together with the occasional backlink from a top site, be it from a guest post I wrote for them, or because they found a piece on Let’s Reach Success useful and added it as a resource. So, let’s talk about how I do SEO as a non-marketer. First, it’s something I’m interested in. It’s like a game and I like reading about it. I got familiar with the basics of on-page SEO early on, and over the years built the habit of writing this way. It’s yet another digital skill, really. Many of my posts are ranking for certain keywords without being written with that in mind, but just because that exact keyword is mentioned a few times throughout the content. However, I enjoy writing a big post every now and then (2000-3500 words) that’s a guide, but also optimized for a long keyword phrase. The latest one, for instance, was How to Become a Millionaire Online. A week after it was published, it appeared as #5 in the SERP.  The keyword research I do is pretty simple. I put a keyword I have in mind related to the topic I feel like writing about in Google Keyword Planner and look at the results. I save 5-10 of the ones that come up, which I like and which don’t have much competition but do have enough searches per month. You can easily rank for a keyword with 100-1K searches, but that could be more too. These results don’t need to be accurate, but what I do next is place the chosen keyword in Google and see what comes on the first page. The point is to have just one or two articles from top sites about this, to check out their content, and to know you can write a better and longer piece. Then you go ahead and write it, while including the keyword enough times.",1,1
110," My marketing strategy was just Facebook – I worked as much as possible in the social platform because the whole Lieferoo audience was there. I tried to get people to find us using all Facebook tools, such as groups, personal posts, and pages. I never carried out any other digital marketing other than having a landing page website and putting it on Google. This was a big mistake! I never marketed it really well. I didn’t even invest in Facebook advertising. I should have actually not only talked to people but also put some money. My innocent idea was to make thousands of dollars with my business whose marketing efforts were based completely on word of mouth. ‍",0,0
111," We have used an independent distributor business model from the start, and that has worked out well for us. I could share dozens of success stories of people from all walks of life who held a wide variety of jobs before becoming independent distributors for LifeWave. Some have made it a part-time job within the gig economy, while others have achieved tremendous success making LifeWave their only business. Marketing has always come easily for our company because we release cutting-edge health products like no other.  Our first product launch was Energy Enhancer in 2004, which earned the company $17 million in gross revenue during the first year of its release. Sales exceeded our expectations and gave us the confidence that people are indeed looking for alternatives to improve their health. We advertised Energy Enhancer mostly by word-of-mouth. After we launched Energy Enhancer, we went on to introduce several patch products that addressed pain, sleep, stress, and anti-aging. Ice Wave as our pain product has been a consistent success and Aeon, which promotes relaxation and reduced stress, has always been a top seller.   I went on stage with the actress Suzanne Somers, one of our Ambassadors who worked with us for 10 years, to launch Aeon. A recording technician from our company captured the initial launch celebration and sent it to our team of independent distributors around the world, who used it to promote Aeon in their local markets. In January of 2019, we released our most successful patch ever, X39. This innovative, patented product elevates a copper peptide, known through previously published studies to activate stem cells. We spent 10 years developing X39 and the minute we launched it, it was an instant hit among distributors worldwide, driving our sales to record levels for the year. The word of mouth on X39 performance was and continues to be breath-taking and perfect validation for the value of using the independent distributor business model. ‍",1,0
112," When it comes to marketing and promotion I had to learn everything. One thing I realised quickly was that SEM wouldn’t be an option in such a competitive industry, and with so few money keywords. Instead I focused on SEO, link building, and content marketing via the blog. Although I’m self-thought on many topics, writing is definitely not my forte. So I hired someone to write content on a regular basis. The blog got traction and the traffic rose steadily. However, the conversion was very disappointing. It was basically costing me money for nothing and I had to stop. The good thing with a blog is when it gets enough authority, you start receiving enough guest post offers to keep posting content on a regular basis. It costs time though. I receive tons of offers, or spam, and ultimately reject 90% of posts. I keep investing this time in the blog because even if it does not generate customers, it is still useful for acquiring backlinks and for giving authority to the money site. The other strategy was to offer free SEO tools. I started with a Backlink Checker giving limited results for free. This worked pretty well. So well actually that every single SEO tool is now offering an equivalent. I had to diversify and develop more free tools like the Google Index Checker. It’s hard to measure but word of mouth also has an impact, some customers said the tool was recommended to them. Finally, I have a few brand advocates that regularly mention the tool or recommend it directly to their partners. ‍",1,0
113," The initial traction was achieved by upselling former customers. It wasn’t sufficient enough though. In order to be ROI positive, we needed more customers and better growth.  We started experimenting with PPC, content marketing, improving onboarding experience, SEO outbound sales and many more. At first, we didn’t have much success but we were still growing continuously. We’ve tried Google AdWords, Bing Ads, Facebook, Twitter and all kinds of other minor PPC networks. The fact that the average customer value was lower than most of our competitors’ and also that they were literally burning investors’ money with PPCs made it especially hard to compete in the Pay Per Click space. We had to find long tail keywords, and competitor keywords which worked out pretty well (be careful to obey Google’s rules). Generic terms like “customer service software” were super expensive and we’ve burned a lot of cash trying to compete the big players. I would not recommend going down this way for other startups. Eventually, we figured out the keywords that were performing well and we’ve been bidding on them until today. Do content, they said. So we did - we pushed out valuable, fact-based, well-formatted blog posts supported by infographics and images. 99% of the blog posts didn’t get much traction. In fact, there are only 2-3 articles that rank well on relevant keywords. Doing content right is hard and we have yet to figure it out. On the other hand, one of the growth strategies, that helped boost growth particularly well, was including LiveAgent in software directories and boosting our presence there. Ever since the beginning, we’ve been a customer-centric company so we had a pretty solid base of satisfied customers. After listing LiveAgent on websites like G2Crowd, Capterra, GetApp or FinancesOnline, we’ve reached out to our audience and invited them to leave a review, good or bad, on one of these websites. We even incentivized their efforts by providing $20 Amazon coupons to everyone who shares their experience. We received hundreds of positive reviews which helped us rank high in comparisons and gained a lot of traffic.  ‍",1,0
114," Over the years since launching the course, we’ve tried several different marketing strategies. But honestly, the thing that has worked the best is putting time and effort into creating content that ranks organically. We focused primarily on a hub and spoke content strategy, where we have one definitive post for our primary keyword, and related “spoke” posts to cover related keywords in more depth. Then we have anywhere from 6-15 “spoke” posts, that all link back to that post, and to each other that go into depth on specific topics mentioned within the hub post. Doing this has led to a lot of natural links, but we’ll also do guest posts around the most valuable topics. We’ve done this for about a dozen different topics on the site, and it’s worked well over the years. Lately, YouTube has also been helping to grow the business and we’ve found that the nature of video has led to higher quality and more engaged followers. That’s the traffic part. As far as conversions go, we decided a few years ago to keep it simple. One funnel and one primary offer. Rather than offering all of our courses ala carte, we wanted to focus on just selling the Academy as a whole. So we tweaked and tested our email series until we had one that converted well, and while we’ve updated it over the years - it’s still fundamentally the same one we’ve been using since it was first created. It’s useful for people that want help and provides the opportunity to get additional handholding for the people that want it. Content marketing with organic traffic is not the sexy thing, and it takes longer than other marketing methods. But we’ve found it to be more sustainable and less fleeting once you do get it right.

115," By no means am I a marketer. I am through and through an engineer with an engineer’s brain (plus maybe a bit of a designer’s brain, too). But to make it clear, it’s hard for me to understand what moves the needle and how to measure the effectiveness of different strategies. That being said, I’ve tried a number of things, such as: reaching out to journalists, replying to random people on Twitter or Reddit, buying ads, etc. None of it worked. And I didn’t particularly love inserting a sales pitch into random people’s lives for a product that wasn’t totally fleshed out. So I continued to do what I love doing, which is 1. improving Lunch Money, and 2. sharing my stories through writing. Lucky for me, both of these have in one way or another contributed to the biggest spikes I have experienced thus far. Writing about my experience as a solo founder and posting them on mediums such as Hacker News, LinkedIn, Twitter and Indie Hackers have proven to be most successful in drawing new users to Lunch Money. And continuously improving Lunch Money keeps my current users happy and drives word-of-mouth marketing. As of now, word-of-mouth marketing and blogging are my best marketing tactics. Word-of-mouth is great because it’s effortless on my part and will grow naturally as I continue to invest in my user’s happiness and satisfaction. Blogging about my experiences and learnings is something that I love to do and I always try to find new and interesting angles to write from. Here are some recent examples of how these tactics helped Lunch Money grow: A few users commented and recommended Lunch Money on a Hacker News post of an article about the downfall of Mint. The comment was probably about 10 comments down from the top, but still drove over 300 signups.A famous Dutch tech influencer Tweeted about Lunch Money and drove over 200 signups.My recent blog post, ""The biggest mistakes I’ve made with Lunch Money (so far)"", made it to the front page of Hacker News and drove over 500 signups. The best part is that all of these are compounding since more and more people will become aware of Lunch Money. My recent blog post which first gained exposure on Hacker News ended up being mentioned by a few other publications including a Japanese podcast!",1,1
116," Until summer 2016, the growth of Mangools was purely organic. We basically didn’t do any targeted marketing activities, PPC campaigns or anything else. I’m familiar with marketing. I’m a fan of some controversial, let’s say grey-hat techniques that force you to experiment but there were no serious marketing activities done for Mangools. That’s why my 2 teammates Frantisek, Martin and I decided to move things up so Maros joined us in July 2016. He was the first guy dedicated to marketing at that time. At first, we focused on the low-hanging fruit. Setting up proper analytics and remarketing campaigns in Google Ads brought us hundreds of new subscriptions. These days, we work a lot with behavioral emailing and inbound marketing thanks to great content. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that a company behind SEO tools has to do SEO as well :) We play with it all the time and optimize all our websites both from the technical and content point of view. We recently hired a new teammate who’s responsible for link building as we see a lot of opportunities in the off-page field too. ‍",1,0
117," I would say it was a mix. Early on, it was our community and some outreach. Now, we’re primarily focusing on SEO, and we might tap into other channels later. Traction for a SaaS is slow at the beginning. But again, don’t give up! SaaS revenue compounds. If you see you have 10 customers, you can probably get 10 more, then 20 more, etc.  In the beginning, focus on positioning and on refining your value proposition. We repositioned 2-3 times since we launched and did many customer interviews to ensure the customers we were after were a good fit for our business. I like to approach marketing as building a product: Marketing should solve problems for your users. So we create content that conveys the messaging on how our product can solve the problems of our target users. Educational blog posts, tips, and tricks in our community, etc. In addition, I think it’s essential to choose a channel where the unit economics make sense for your business. If your SaaS is $10/month, it’s mostly going to be self-serve and product-led growth and SEO. However, if you’re selling a $1,000/month B2B service or productized service, you can probably invest in outreach. Lastly, knowing our SaaS numbers early on can help you with decision making. Next to marketing, our key priority is retention. In August 2021, we got negative net churn for the first time, which was an incredible feeling.  So we are focusing on two things: Onboarding: Product onboarding and customer successExpansion revenue: How can we build more features for our power users. ",1,0
118," We’ve relied primarily on word of mouth and our inbound marketing engine. We built up our blog, optimized conversion rates, and launched an educational webinar series. We pride ourselves on educating our audience first, whether they choose to work with us or not, so they receive some value from us that impacts their strategy. We also often participate in in-person and digital events like webinars, podcasts, Twitter spaces, etc. Over the past year, I have been a guest on over 50 podcasts on the topic of AI, content marketing, and SEO strategy. These are wonderful ways to connect with our audience as they research and work through their pain points or seek advice on content strategy. This is that educational piece again -- it’s so important to offer your expertise through content and build credibility if you want a chance at converting your audience to customers. We saw a dramatic burst in Q4 of 2015. We honed our sales process and tapped into our network to drive opportunities. Word-of-mouth then started playing a more significant role. Since we were proposing a novel concept, people were interested in learning more. Nothing can replace the moment you see people experience the ah-ha moments of your platform, and the wheels start turning on the possibilities ahead of them. We know our audience very well. Our Premium offering is compelling and gives you an advantage, but it’s not for everyone because it’s an investment. We’ve created products that work for all budget sizes (even $0) and work closely with the organizations we know are an excellent fit for our Premium offering -- then we grow together. ",1,0
119," Our marketing strategy has been almost exclusively digital. We certainly have a presence at various art and trade shows around the country but we find time and time again that the most effective thing for us is Google. Showing up in search is so valuable and nothing in our marketing has ever come close. SEO and PPC are both very detail-oriented tasks, that require much patience and experimentation. I’d spend hours daily in the first couple years looking at our AdWords and optimizing them.  We now have gotten to a point where there is not much room left for optimizing and we’ve maximized our budget. I will say we are having a harder and harder time finding new avenues for marketing. Facebook hasn’t been successful, nor has social media as a whole. Mobile is where we have the most room for growth. Beyond that, we have lots of new products we are launching including new frames, and possibly prints in the near future. ‍",1,0
120," Our business was two-sided, so growth relied on obtaining cooks and customers. I thought obtaining customers would be easy, but it was the cooks that were far easier. Posting in community centers, online websites, putting up blogs, and word of mouth got us dozens of sign-ups. People were signing up so fast, we needed to create a better way of tracking signups. We also needed to ask more questions on our form and as a result there were knowledge gaps across different people that had signed up. To obtain customers, we tried a few things, but we also got really lucky. I quit my job in September to go full time on this, after working on the side for about 5 months. Etan and Justin joined me and we would work out of coffee shops and each other’s homes until November, when we were accepted into one of Toronto’s top accelerators - the Ryerson Digital Media Zone - the DMZ . The incubator gave us some office space, publicity, a strong network, and also earned us a mentor who offered us a chance to do an interview with CBC Radio. My gut told me not to do the interview, because we weren’t ready for the fanfare. The media was riding on the Uber wave, and the tide was high. Our website and team were not ready to experience the high volumes. I checked with the team and they said we should get publicity, and I could tell that after two months of doing coffee shop work and not seeing significant profits, they needed an uplift. I agreed to do the interview on a Tuesday morning at the CBC studio - big mistake. The interview started at 7 am, and by 7:45 am our website had crashed twice. It’s safe to say the interview went well, and we had thousands of people sign up to either cook for us, or join our newsletter. We had lots of feedback and people willing to work for us to make this thing grow. All of this happened from one radio interview at 7 am. Unbelievable. In the following days, Justin, Etan, I and a new team member named Shub worked very hard to make sure we were responsive and ready for the additional traffic. The radio interview also got interested press from local newspapers to contact us for further interviews. Within the week, we were featured on Fast Company, two online blogs, and front page of the Toronto Metro. Even though we were not financially successful, it felt like we were kings. Press and false status are killers. I started to feel less humble about my work, and started to overlook potential problems, assuming everything would be fine. My parents took extra copies of the newspaper, I was stopped a few times by people on the street, and I had old employers and classmates reaching out to congratulate me. I even started dating a girl outside my league! I let it get to my head. The biggest problem, however, was not the way I started to see myself or the business, it was the negative feedback I was receiving. Specifically, it was an email from Toronto Public Health about our operations. I knew this day would come and I was prepared for it, but there were still many surprises. Before I go into the email and how it eventually led to one of the big reasons why the business didn’t work, it’s worth mentioning other things we tried in the realm of marketing. We spent a lot of time using Facebook and Reddit ads, and we still posted flyers and sent postcards to local neighbourhoods. This form of advertising had limited reach - somewhere in the area of 5-10% uptake. Looking back, however, we should have focused on niche areas where restaurants were not supplying the right products. This means areas where there were more vegan needs, or places that had higher halal food expectations. If there was a way to plot this on a map (Google restaurant API, cross-referenced with blogTO or other social data about the neighbourhood) we could have targeted better. Hindsight 2020. We also tried refer a friend, community events, tasters, mixers, partnering with grocery stores and Yelp but ultimately all of those areas were either break even or loss-making. The newsletter + organic social media approach was really helpful. Since this idea had a really strong communal element to it, it made sense that these mediums worked well. I am really grateful we brought on Vanessa , who was helping out at the DMZ at the time to show us what we needed to do in these areas to succeed. ‍ ‍ Overall it was fun bringing people together but very few ended up becoming initial and even more so recurring customers. We raised awareness and many people knew what we were up to, so from a growth and consumer business standpoints we were a success. However not enough people were trying our products or coming back. We had educated the market, but the crux of product-market fit remained elusive. Businesses like this really thrive on a local, word of mouth approach. Creating small groups and managing growth in specific areas should have been the way to go.   TLDR: Incubator helped us out, also using social media and the obvious online tools.Radio interview put us on the map.Tried many marketing avenues, but struggled.",1,0
121," I undersold my little “influencer technique”. Adding these known faces as mentors did have some impact. The first ever paid customer joined the site around 2-3 weeks after launch. I saw the application come in, saw the mentor accept it, saw the mentee set up their payment, and boom – I got my first $5 or so (I had a very unattractive commission scheme back then). Turns out, their mentor profile got indexed by Google and when they were researching about this known developer figure, they found the offering and took the chance. So, I’d say this was probably how we got our first 10 paying customers. I ended up spending an hour or two per day just getting new mentors to sign up. Over time, the team grew from 10 mentors to 20, then 30, then 50. Most of them were able to get someone on their network to sign up with them. Later, I recognized how powerful search was for this. I ended up creating a lot of different landing pages that today dominate the first page of Google. I invested a lot into our blog, becoming a welcome resource for career changers. Whenever someone complains online about not being able to find a mentor, we are there too. However, this took years to pay off. But in the end, it’s all about the service. The fact that existing mentors tell their coworkers and friends. The fact that mentees write about us and tell their friends. It’s a nice network effect where every new mentor usually also attracts other mentees and mentors. Today, we do a lot to sustain our growth and momentum. We have a new affiliate program, we run a referral scheme for mentors, we do paid ads, we ask mentors to share more, we have a community blog and incentivize mentors to do well. ‍",1,0
122," Building the product was the easy part, selling it is where it gets tricky. You know, creating something people want and asking them to pay you for it is something they don’t teach you at school.  I started off by contacting marketing influencers and asking them to write a review of out tool on their blog. That worked out really well. Later, I focused on content marketing and email marketing drip campaigns for user onboarding & activation. Drip campaigns are great for automation. Content marketing hasn’t been so effective at attracting the right kind of customers. I also launched an affiliate program to motivate our best users and marketing bloggers to promote our tools. This tactic has worked well, bringing a steady number of new users every month. I’ve tried every possible tactic but I haven’t experienced that “exponential growth” that all marketers preach about. I’m quite disappointed with marketing, it might work with B2C products but I’ve recently found out that for B2B a CRM and plain old sales work best. That’s why now I’m looking to partner with someone who’s an expert in sales in order to take the company to the next level. ‍",1,0
123," While I’ve tried almost literally every B2B marketing strategy you can imagine with my SaaS companies, the projects I’ve described above are much more audience and relationship-driven. So, for example, PPC ads aren’t going to have the same effect as they might for a software tool. These days we focus on creating the best content we know across our essays, videos, and podcasts.  ",1,0
124," We initially relied a lot on PR from the launch to get the brand in front of people and very quickly we become recognizable as a cricket bat brand. It was hard not to be recognized when your product looks so different!  ‍ Once the brand and bat were recognized, the next battle was to gain acceptance in the market and that could only be done through usage. We raised a round of investment from a number of high net worth individuals, who worked in the City, and went to work on signing up professional cricketers who could be sponsored by us and use the brand. The first player signed was Stuart Law, a veteran of the game who was playing for one of the smaller County sides. As an elder statesman of the game he lent some credence to the brand, however, he only played a single match with the bat and that match was not televised. We therefore needed to branch out and sign additional players, who would ideally be playing in televised tournaments. In total over the 2 years we sponsored around 30 players, ranging from the photogenic England bowler James Anderson, through to star Australian batsman Matthew Hayden.  ‍ Mongoose produced 2 bats for our players, the small, famous MMi3 bat and a more traditional bat called the CoR3. Players were heavily incentivized to use the more famous bat as it would result in lots more coverage for the brand if they performed.  By relying solely on endorsements through professional players the whole success of the brand in turn relies on the performances of those players when the cameras are turned on them. An injury, an unlucky shot, or seeing the player dropped from the side would still see the player earn their retainer as a sponsored player of Mongoose. For a star batsman of a side in the Indian Premier League (the premier Twenty20 tournament at the time) we were needing to pay around $100,000 in fees, for what was a 5-week tournament. A player, if selected, would play 14 games in that tournament so we were needing to pay around $7,000 per match before they’d even hit a ball.  This montage was put together by ITV, just after Hayden had score 93 off 43 balls: Within the sponsorship contracts were also some fun bonuses and incentives. Some of these were realistic and were designed to reward the player for strong performances, others were completely unrealistic and had almost zero chance of every happening - however they made a good PR story. Remember the Lord’s Pavilion that Albert Trott hit the ball over? If a Mongoose player were to clear that he’d receive £250,000 ($350,000) in cash. Trott cleared the pavilion in 1899, no-one had done it since and they probably never will - but it helped make a few headlines when we signed one player who probably wouldn’t have made headlines otherwise. ‍",0,0
125," At Mubert, we genuinely believe in our brand and the power it carries. For us, cultivating our community through word of mouth, collaborating with companies that share our values, choosing to endorse B2B API solutions, supporting artists and democratizing the creator economy is essential. We've collaborated with companies like Sensorium, SkillBox, Restream, DepositPhotos and we’re preparing a bunch of new amazing collaborations in the future.  Moreover, we’ve used Product Hunt as an instrument for lead generation. We had 6 launches there, one every time we launched a new product. The last one was last month, and we had a massive push for our latest product - Mubert Render. All the launches brought us leads, developed our community and validated our ideas. As we’ve made some pivots (sometimes I call myself the Chief Pivot Officer), we started different marketing campaigns for every new product. Of course, we don’t rely only on brand power. We also do SEO-focused articles, ad campaigns, influencers campaigns and PR.  ",1,0
126," At first, I really tried to leverage my network. Simply (cold) emails. I also wrote some blogs writing about small pains coworking might have: setup an environment to boost productivity, how to focus on the community aspect, etc. I had a product tour video created to more easily explain how easy the product was to use. But I didn't push any of these strategies hard enough. For all of them, I did the bare minimum. I did not continue writing useful content. I did not follow up on emails and saw no reply as no interest. Though the blog posts generated page visits, only a really small percentage created an account. You know this is to be expected, but it still sucked all the joy out of working on it more.",0,0
127," As we are a marketplace business, we need to grow both sides in tandem for the business to work nicely. Without garages, we don’t have anywhere for our customers to go, but without customers, we don’t have much value to garages.  Starting with garage side growth, we’ve had to keep it old school. A big aspect of our growth has been picking up the phone, sending letters in the post but nothing seems to work better than just walking into a garage and having a face to face conversation.  With the increase in e-commerce through COVID, we know we’re in a great position to provide the best digital solution. This is where our focus lies being a digital business. The plan is to ‘Win the Internet’, to win the customer. Pre-COVID, our marketing strategy was pretty bare in all honesty, our focus was growing the marketplace in terms of supply first of garages, rather than demand from customers. But COVID allowed us to grow our network size, as we could build on the narrative of helping garages get more work in their doors as the current economy puts a squeeze on their own customer base. We’ve really started to see some traction in the last couple of months, just as we’re beginning to better define our GTM strategy. It obviously feels great that there’s validation from New Zealand customers as they use our service, but there’s still plenty of work still to be done. ‍",1,0

People like to touch, feel and get to test the scooter and we get to have invaluable feedback from them and to enjoy seeing their reaction when riding for the first time.

129," My primary strategy was to rank in the top ten search results on Amazon for my targeted keywords. Terms like “inflatable lounger” and “air chair” were being searched thousands of times per day.  The problem is, the way Amazon works, to get a better ranking you need to sell more units. It’s based on the Amazon Best Seller Rank. It’s a formula based on how many items you sell over a period of time, the more you sell in less time, the better your Best Seller Rank. The better your Best Seller Rank, the higher you will climb in the rankings on Amazon. So, to start, I was using JumpSend. It’s a tool that helps you run a marketing campaign off of Amazon to get sales quickly and improve your Best Seller Ranking. To use JumpSend, you sell your product at an extremely discounted price. Usually 50% to 75% off. JumpSend will send your discounted offer to their list of subscribers to get you a bunch of sales quickly (though you take a loss on the sale). JumpSend also sets up an automated email campaign, so everyone that bought your Amazon product will receive an email asking them to leave a review. This combination of getting sales quickly, and getting 5-star reviews, will bump your ranking into the top ten search results. I also used paid advertising on Amazon. I paid $15 per day for Amazon to display my product on the front page for my keywords. Additionally, I was running a website for NE Lounge. I was driving traffic to the website and producing content with the goal of driving more traffic to my Amazon listing.  ‍",0,0
130," The best way to get customers has been Craigslist. We just posted on Craigslist every day and we find lots of good clients (and a lot of bad clients as well!). We're working on social media right now, and we're also working on a blog and a big guide. One of the big problems that we see is that when people are coming to us with new projects, there's no standardized format. People rarely have a document together with their ideas or examples ready. That’s why we are working on a guide which is going to help a lot of people when they want to create some software or website putting all of their ideas together presenting them to a developer/development team. We once tried Google AdWords, but we were not able to make it successful. I think that if we try it again in a different way we might have a little luck. ‍",1,0
131,"  I’ve done very little in terms of marketing. I’ve got some automated tweets going out every day that share content from the site and other than that, it was just the initial launch on Product Hunt. I’ve tried to focus on engagement rather than growth from the very start and that seems to bring organic growth. Within the first couple of days of launching the Slack channel, I could tell the idea had some level of traction as there was engagement straight away. I didn’t want to ruin that by having a massive influx of new users and taking away the 1-1 relationships that people were building. I’ve done a lot of analysis to understand who the users are. Now that I have a better idea of who the primary users are, I can now start to focus more on marketing efforts and begin to grow the community more rapidly.  I monetized NCF just under a year ago. The revenue split has been about 50/50 since then between PRO memberships (B2C) and paid partnerships (B2B). Memberships have contributed around $20k and that is fully automated as it’s an upsell on the site so I’ve not had to do anything to win those sales. The B2B partnerships most often came from tools reaching out to me directly. I’ve had over 100 no-code platforms enquire about paid partnerships in the past 12 months. As well as this, I’ve done some direct outreach to tools that I thought would be a good fit, and several tools signed up that way too. ‍",1,0
132," Step one of growth marketing is always to start with a great product that delights users, so we worked hard to drive outstanding results for our early partners and let the work speak for itself, leading to many referrals. These early clients were pivotal, both by proving our squad model works and for nominating us to TechCrunch, where we were selected as a Verified Expert Growth Marketing Agency, one of our first major PR victories. So our primary acquisition tactic has really been focusing on driving exceptional quality of service to our existing clients. This often gets us more business within the brand and beyond when talents move between brands.  At the end of the day, we make a better margin in the long term, so fewer clients, higher quality is the way our model works best.  Content marketing via our NoGood blog has been a great lever as well. Leveraging our growth marketing expertise in Content, Social, and SEO, our organic traffic is up over 630% year over year and has served as a reliable secondary source of lead generation. As far as sales, a significant differentiator for NoGood is that we donʼt have a classic sales bench. From our first conversation, our clients work directly with our growth marketers, where we learn what success means to each business and how we can translate that success into measurable metrics. Clients often have a vague idea of what success looks like, but they donʼt really have well-defined metrics. Our team helps them define both from day one. ‍",1,0
133," When we first started, we leveraged our connections with the clubs and marketed to their existing customers. We also relied heavily on social media and email marketing in order to grow our user base.  We had good results, especially when we did social media contests, where we would reward the winner with a bottle of alcohol. This allowed us to grow our reach and build a good following. We used content and regular newsletters to engage our users and educate them on new alcohol brands.  We used Klaviyo for our email management, Shopify to create promo codes, and Google Analytics to track and evaluate our marketing campaigns. ",0,0
134," I can’t stress enough how important our partners have been. Working with Microsoft has been incredible. When Satya Nadella showcased our H&M selfie mirror at Envision in 2018, the interest in Ombori suddenly went through the roof. We’ve also worked with Samsung, Avanade, and TechData, and, most importantly, ITAB, which invested in Ombori Grid a couple of years ago.  Having partners like these means that we can get access to C-level decision-makers at major brands like Warner, Target, or IKEA, and we go into meetings with immense credibility. Of course, it’s like adding a bunch of salespeople to the team. In addition, we‘ve done a lot of content marketing, blogging, guest posts, and so on. Perhaps the ones I enjoy most have been our live-streamed events. We’ve had thousands of people tuning in to watch them, and we’ve had immense support from clients and partners.  To celebrate and highlight the impact of the Ombori Grid Marketplace apps, we recently held a live-streamed event, which can be viewed here:  ",1,0
135," We launched with a Kickstarter campaign during the summer of 2016. Timing is always a guess for the launching of a new product, but the season peaks in July. We had a lot of media attention thanks to the Bizidee prize we won in May and our promotional trip through Europe, which we could leverage to launch the product internationally. With this initial boost, a lot of work and the help of the marketing agencies Hyperstarter and FINN, we were able to reach 25% of our goal within one day. Online social and press media were our main sales channels for the Kickstarter campaign, and given the visual character of our product, video worked especially well. In the end, we went absolutely viral with it and were featured in Business Insider Design where we reached more than a million views in one day. We even appeared in Time Magazine as well. All of this was combined with being visible in real life. We were present at the Outdoor show during the middle of the campaign and won the Outdoor Award for the best startup there. This gave us extra attention and made it possible for people to see and feel our product. Like with every Kickstarter the first few hours and days are very important. We quickly reached the magically 30% of our goal thanks to our campaign before the launch. Between 30% and 70%, backing slowed a little bit down. So, we worked very hard to get featured as much as possible. And then after the 70%, it was like a rocket. Orders came in so fast we even couldn’t follow. What really worked for us was being 24/24 and 7/7 being involved with communication, answering questions, adapting the FAQ. ‍",1,0
136," Since I've created so many different websites from inception to their current state and have consistently repeated a model where my websites generate income, most of my marketing strategies are focused on three different areas now. First is to find the right niche and focus on keyword research to make sure that the amount of search volume is worth creating a website. This is the most crucial part and when you decide whether creating the website is worth it in the first place.  The second step is creating quality content, and lots of it. At this point, I rarely write content myself and outsource most of it, but there are certain times when I'll write a blog post or a review because I feel like I know how to explain things better than some of my writers. Usually what will happen on a new website I launch is I'll wait till I have about 50 articles on the site itself before I begin any outreach to try to link build. Which brings me to my third and final step, link building. This is definitely where I spend the majority of my time nowadays and although it's an acquired skill, this is by far the most important skill you can have when marketing a website.  If you want to succeed with SEO, which is all that I really focus on, this is necessary to succeed. Nowadays I spend most my time reviewing what my editor publishes on my websites and link building. I have a very systematic approach to everything that I do so I found a way to streamline the process so that I mostly just answer emails, and as I do that my content continues to be created by my team. In the beginning, it wasn't this way, but now that I've got some decent revenue each month I can reinvest in growing the websites by hiring people to help.  Here’s a snapshot of my most successful site showing SEO traffic growth since I created it:",1,0
137," Vishal originally launched OneUp on Product Hunt, where it did pretty well and attracted some of the first paying customers. This was a major form of validation because you never really know if you have a good product unless someone is willing to pay you for it. We did, however, have some validation going in from some of our competitors, like Hootsuite and Buffer, who do millions of dollars in annual recurring revenue. The initial launch provided the opportunity to talk to customers, work out the bugs, make improvements, and see what kind of features users are looking for. Virtually everything we build is the direct result of customer feedback. For example, Hacker Noon, one of the largest tech publications in the world, was looking for a way to automatically post to their social media page every time they published a new blog post – and also have each post repeat again once a month for the next 3 months on social media. We could definitely build this, but we wanted to be sure that we were building something that customers actually value enough that they are willing to pay for it. So we worked out a custom pricing agreement and secured payment before ever working on this feature. A week later, OneUp made it easy to import any blog, podcast, or YouTube RSS feed, and have posts from those feeds automatically shared at your preferred intervals across your social media accounts. Most recently, we launched OneUp 2.0 on Product Hunt in September of 2018, and finished fourth for the day with over 550 upvotes. This led to over 1400 visitors on launch day and the following couple days. While the Product Hunt performance provides great social proof and will probably serve as a small source of traffic moving forward, it is not a long term plan for success as many people on Product Hunt aren’t in our target market.

138," Not an awful lot to be quite honest. We’re still generating a healthy number of leads from traffic coming from other products in our portfolio. Additionally, we have done some SEO and content marketing efforts which are now, after several months, finally starting to deliver some results. We have done some small experiments with paid acquisition, however until we reach product-market fit, or get very close, we’re holding off serious investments in marketing Pagestead. We’re quite comfortable with the current growth rate. It allows to put critical parts of the business in place, such as customer support, in preparation for faster growth in the future.  We have been seeing traction since before launching.

139," I never did much advertising. I feel like this is one indicator that your project is going to be successful. If you don't have to do any advertising and you get more and more users every day, then that is a good sign. I put up a parked page that linked to park.io for every domain that we were able to catch, and this lead to many of the first users. I was surprised when I launched it and I had a couple of orders the first day. It just happened like that - each day a few more users would sign up and place orders. I haven't done much to grow park.io. I have tried to make the service work really well and I have added some TLDs. I have also done some interviews. But other than that, I don't think I have done anything else - it has grown by word of mouth and I think just the growth of .io domains, in general, has helped the growth of park.io. I would advise hackers to simply focus on the product and put love into their product. Build it so that you have happy users. You can do some interviews or blog posts and put them on Hacker News, or things like this, but you shouldn't have to do too much or spend too much time or money on marketing. If it is one of the 1% of your projects destined to success, it should grow quickly on its own. ‍",1,0
140," When we initially released, Facebook ADs worked well and we were able to drive enough traffic in order to test whether or not the app works, and helps people. During the last few months, we’ve begun releasing a lot of in-depth pain science content on our blog. This has started to gain more and more traffic, which I believe (and hope) will continue into the future. By next month, we’d like to start running ads - beginning with a Universal App Campaign. And in 2-3 months, I believe we’ll be in a position to create regular good content for our YouTube channel. App subscribers have been organically growing (with revenue along with that). Although we’re still some way away from breaking even and the true test will be how well we’re able to convert traffic once we begin advertising. Even the initial marketing of this business versus previous ventures has helped me realize just how much Google, Facebook, and other traffic sources have changed over the years. You can no longer create something, publish a few articles, and hope to gain traffic. To survive and thrive, business owners truly need to create something great. You need to consistently put in the effort to make your product worth talking about, sharing, and linking to. You need to be a specialist in your area to reap the rewards. I see these increased barriers to entry as a good thing - fly-by-night operations have less chance of succeeding and businesses that make a real investment into their product and content will over time, make the most progress.",1,0
141," The first thing that we did was make simple door hangers with a $25 discount for all services. We also offered free inspections to help get us business in the beginning. We posted on Porch and Thumbtack, which surprisingly was being underutilized by other chimney companies in our market, but used by a lot of customers in the area. We also made a huge effort to make our Yelp, Facebook, and Google Business page at least better than everyone else in the area and began paying for the Yelp ads pretty much right off the bat so we could be ranked higher on their pages.  Since Porch and Thumbtack wasn’t used by our competitors that often, it honestly wasn’t that long after we started until we actually picked up traction. In fact, in our first month, August 2018, we earned just shy of $12,000. This felt incredible since we built something from scratch that earned that much in its first month. I think our timing was just right for us as well since we got started just before the burn season, which is the busiest time for all chimney companies. There’s a good possibility that our customers called us last and went with our service since we could put them on the schedule sooner than our competitors. Now we’re already booked through January and have February closing up as well.  Currently, we don’t offer free inspections or post on Porch or Thumbtack as much anymore (we’re more selective), but we still use door hangers, Yelp, Facebook, and Google like the beginning. We do focus a lot on Facebook and Adwords PPC ads, but a lot of our business comes organically - SEO, referrals, and word of mouth. I work with a company called Godot Media to help create blogs for our website but also work to get backlinks and listings on directories to help bump us up on Google. Godot Media is a company in India that provides different “levels” of content for a pretty decent price. I provide the topics, send it over, and each month I get two 1500 word blogs for about $60. Honestly, the quality isn’t the greatest at the lowest level, which I pay for, but it gets a lot of the work out of the way. I simply go back through, change some words around to fit the southern Virginia tone, and publish. For companies with a lower budget, I definitely recommend doing it how I’ve done it.  We also have a “customer packet” that we share with each of our customers that includes the condition report, referral cards, a list of our other services, and then a postcard where we ask for a review on Facebook, Google, or Yelp.   We’ve also recently hired a door to door salesman, Kyle, who goes through neighborhoods in our market, knocking on doors and leaving newer door hangers. We’ve also implemented a sales cadence that allows for us to consistently reach out to our prospects in a more organized manner. It utilizes a mix of door hangers and mailers, plus targeting homes located in the area with PPC ads to try to boost brand awareness and hopefully taking advantage of the Rule of Seven, which basically says that prospects need to come across your brand at least seven times before they really notice it and start to take action. I’ve heard it’s sometimes up to 12 times, but seven is a good place to start.   Finally, another huge tactic that we use is calling past clients to remind them that the NFPA recommends their chimney be inspected annually by a CSIA trained professional. We also make sure to call all open quotes within 2 days of submitting the proposal and again 2 days after that to try and win the deal. This has helped increase our close rate for open quotes and helped contribute to a strong return rate for our past customers.  ‍",1,0
142," Nathan and I had just gotten back from traveling Europe for 10 weeks and at that time I hadn’t received a paycheck in almost 8 months when PEAR became a reality, so our marketing then (and still to this day) is primarily through social media & word of mouth. We use Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to reach out to people and share as much information as possible. We will be focusing a lot more on this in the coming months, seeing as we have a website and product to sell now. We’ve been lucky to have local press reach out to us and have even given some talks and workshops in front of people which is great for marketing your business and product as well. The Kickstarter was great as well, but nothing “viral” or close to it. I think about 5% of our purchases on the Kickstarter were organically through the website itself, so it definitely helped, but it wasn’t what I had hoped for, unfortunately.",1,0
143," I guess that was the problem, I didn’t have one or any. I was hoping for some -- any -- kind of natural, viral growth. But it just didn’t happen. It was hard to get even one single user to contribute anything that wasn’t the most bottom-tier, effortless kind of post. It seemed like 99% of posts/comments were made with just the idea of doing the bare minimum to receive a Bitcoin micropayment. I believe there was a problem with the model altogether -- that when you suddenly introduce money into the equation (and it’s, say, nickels or dimes in Bitcoin equivalent, in this situation), people may feel even less likely to contribute. That is, then if they were just receiving imaginary Internet karma points. (Even though Phez had the notion of karma, too.) One thing I’ve noticed over the years is that dominant social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have pushed out many of the smaller sites, where one used to be able to find content. Back in the day, one could email a handful of bloggers and get the word out about a new project. It’s much more difficult to do that today.",0,0
144," We had two primary sales channels. We participate in tradeshows to get clients, and we have a strong SEO presence. A tradeshow is like having instant access to hundreds or thousands of hot leads while every rival is standing right next to you. It's harsh, draining, and amazing all at the same time. As a product, you must stand out. We could spend $10,000 on a location and another $10,000 on staff and set up supplies. The margins become much tighter, but if you choose good shows, the kinds that your current consumers enjoy, you'll do well. The best tradeshow-selection tip I can give is to simply ask your clients where they'll be and go there. Partly to sell, and partially to meet your customers face to face. You can never devote enough time to learning about your clients. Learning how to serve others with what you do is the most valuable time you can spend on your business. SEO is a complicated world to understand. I recommend hiring the best person you can and allowing them to focus on their strengths. Sometimes this entails bringing the service in-house, and other times you need an outside agency. The ROI here is huge for us. It all comes back to what I stated before about choosing the tradeshow where your clients would be. Choose the communication channel that your clients prefer.",1,0
145," I used to “spam” about Photopea all over the internet. I wrote a comment about Photopea under each article about Photoshop alternatives. I posted on Reddit, Hacker News, etc. 90% of my posts and comments were marked as self-promotion and deleted. Also, I begged random YouTubers to review Photopea, 90% of them ignored me, and 10% asked for money (which I did not have back then). But various people reviewed Photopea “spontaneously” (without being in touch with me), and such articles and videos drew more attention to Photopea over the last 8 years. I used to monetize my games with ads since 2006, so it was a “well-known” monetization strategy. That is how Google, Facebook, and others generate the majority of their income. Almost all Photopea income comes from ads. ‍",1,0
146," Our marketing is a bit different and a bit unconventional compared to the normal way of doing things in the startup world. We say no to most of the best marketing practices. We don’t do any paid advertising, we don’t use pixels and other tracking to do retargeting around the web, we don’t do any experiments on our website visitors, we don’t have an affiliate program and we don’t pay anyone to promote or recommend Plausible.   What we focus on is content marketing and community engagement. We write and publish regular posts on our blog and we engage on different social media platforms and niche community sites. I joined Uku in the middle of March this year and I published my first blog post on April 8th with the headline of Why you should stop using Google Analytics on your website. Since then we’ve pretty much published one blog post per week or so. Our posts are not salesy. They are longer pieces and well-researched pieces on the different topics that are relevant to our product and our audience. We always start with the audience in mind. What questions do they have? What issues are they trying to solve? And we create content trying to do just that. We got traction immediately as the first post I published did great on communities such as Hacker News and it got a lot of attention. That first post has been read by about 65,000 people until now. You can see here our website traffic since I started. We actually have all of our website stats open to the public so you can take a look at our live demo here and explore and dig deeper. ‍",1,0
147," We knew marketing would have to be done well because we had the classic “chicken and egg problem.” We overcame that by doing things that didn’t scale (initially legally giving away branded bags of cannabis for downloads, co founders automatically matching with users on their first playdate, etc) and by creating content for inbound marketing. We also had a theory that because the app sent curated matches, our users wouldn't see or feel a significant loss in UX based on low user density. This would allow our user base to steadily grow and provide better matches over time, as long as we could retain a good number of users. We explored several marketing avenues, beginning with a grassroots campaign. We created hundreds of branded bags of pot and gave them out to legal adults throughout campuses and popular smoke spots in exchange for app downloads. This was technically legal because we weren’t selling it and it was impossible to construe this as sales because our app was completely free. This also helped us seed a small user base in a small space. This ended up burning us in the end (pun intended) because these users didn't stick around, causing terrible retention and poor matches.  SEO was difficult because we couldn't get many good inbound links (I spent a few hours writing a Medium article but it went nowhere), but we had our SEO bases covered on our website. ASO was much easier by identifying lower-competition, higher-traffic keywords like ""meet people fast"", we were able to become #1 in the App Store for a search for ""playdate"", ""meet people fast"", and ""meet stoners.""  The thing that worked best for us was our inbound marketing. Facebook and Twitter were pretty worthless, and we wrote one blog post which had a really low ROI. Instagram ended up being how we got most of our users. We created an Instagram profile with daily memes that had mild success. We grew to thousands of users by providing people with content they wanted and infrequently converting them into app users. We also paid influencers to advertise us, which was a total crapshoot. Some influencers that we didn't think would do well charged $100 and we got many hundreds of followers. Others that we thought would do much better, like Cheech and Chong's official profile, barely moved the needle.  ‍   ",0,0

We’ve extended our outbound efforts into direct sales upon fully transitioning into the API space. ",1,0
149," Due to my eCommerce background, I knew that online marketing was essential to the project’s success. My strategy went into 3 directions: Adwords: We started with a moderate budget and kept a close eye on the ads’ performance. Pretty soon I discovered we were having a huge number of clicks from countries which we didn’t mean to target and where we had a low conversion (India, Indonesia, Malaysia), so we decided to split our campaigns into 2: West (high budget) vs East (low budget).Strong content: I was blogging about lessons learned from experiences of my clients, such as “Is it worth offering ‘free shipping’ deals” which brought many online retailers founders into knowing the tool.Going public with the list of websites monitored: I know that this sounds controversial, but my logic was ‘If we can monitor thousands of websites, why not say it out loud, with concrete names listed?’. Further, the fact that we monitor that particular website didn’t mean that we were disclosing on whose behalf we were monitoring it. And finally, publicly announcing that we could monitor a particular website also meant that we felt confident that this website would be able to block our traffic. All of the above strategies were purely online and were quite a success. However, I noticed that while very good in attracting small and medium businesses, these strategies did not do well with enterprise-level clients. This is why in 2015 we started attending trade shows and professional conferences, in some cases as sponsors, in some cases just a s regular attendees. The result was mixed if we attended a trade show industry where we were particularly strong, the success was great. However, in the case of industries that we were trying to get a foothold into, the results were very poor. Put it together, the results were inconclusive so we decided to invest more into what was already performing well (online marketing) while keeping conferences, but selecting them really carefully. Speaking of revenue, I remember the first time I seriously analyzed Price2Spy revenue was in 2013. Until then, Price2Spy was a side income and whatever it brought in was considered a success. The development resources it required were already there (most of the time working on other projects, for our outsourcing clients) so we were practically working on Price2Spy in spare time. In 2013 I hired the first account manager to handle support questions and that was a clear sign that Price2Spy was becoming a viable source of income. However, 2015 was the turning point, as 2 important things happened Out of the blue, we got an offer to sell Takolako. By that time, I was seeing that our eCommerce business was stagnating and taking too many resources from a much more profitable project (Price2Spy). On the other hand, the fact that we had a very diverse and profitable business meant that we were able to negotiate a fairly good price. After a couple of months, Takolako had a new owner and we had offloaded other eCommerce stores into a new legal entity with me as a majority owner and with an experienced and loyal colleague acting as a CEO.‍Our largest client for outsourced web development got into some financial troubles so he cut our contract. While it was a significant financial blow it also meant that our 6 most experienced developers could now spend their full time on Price2Spy. And fortunately enough, Price2Spy was at that stage earning enough to keep paying them. From that moment on, Price2Spy got our absolute focus. We still do some development gigs (as we have some very loyal clients from our early days), but put it all together financially speaking, Price2Spy means now 93% of our income. ‍",1,0
150," Before ProcessKit, I’ve built up an audience of other client services, software, agency, and consultancy business founders. I had talked a lot with them and taught many the concept of productized services. Part of this community came from a course and community I run that’s called Productize, two podcasts about bootstrapped and productized businesses and a weekly newsletter where I give updates on what I’ve been working in. This audience is a perfect fit for ProcessKit, so that’s where the firsts order interest came from. That’s also where my customer research interviews, early beta testers group, and first paying customer came from. Now that about a year in, ProcessKit is starting to grow beyond my personal audience. We have some organic traffic coming in from different sources and some word of mouth. I'm also starting to do a lot more work on the positioning of ProcessKit. I’ve recently finished doing a deep dive into a lot of customer interviews and surveys so as to really dial in the messaging and find out who this product is for.  In the upcoming year, I plan to do more around partnerships related to working with other people who speak to client services agencies as well as process consultants (people who consult businesses on their processes), and a number of other marketing strategies like SEO and content.

151," At the time, I didn’t have an audience from an email list or a social media account. I did, however, have the motivation and sales skills to do a lot of cold emails and I was good at speaking one-on-one with people thanks to my agency business. My primary strategy was using cold emails and social media for attracting users. I didn’t have a good result with my social media marketing. I tried some social media ads, but the conversion was terrible I definitely need to learn more about social media marketing. For cold emailing, I got much better results--even though it required more effort. I mainly tried to reach companies in the services industries like construction and marketing agencies. Only getting ten paying users required a ton of cold emailing and follow-ups.  I used tools like Mailtrack to track opened emails, Snov.io to find email addresses, and Gmail as an email provider (so that my email address would look more personal). 70% of my emails were opened, but only a small number of them actually replied to me.

152," In April I was able to get Pull Reminders published in the GitHub Marketplace. This felt like a big moment but it took a lot of work and I wasn’t sure what the results would be. Thankfully it’s given me a nice boost in signups and accelerated my growth. Since then I’ve mostly been focused on improving my product. I have experimented with a referral program but it hasn’t gotten any traction. I’m still trying to figure out why. First, I tried to offer a package of free gourmet coffee per referral. Then I switched to Amazon gift cards. Right now, it’s a dual-incentive system where both the referrer and the invitee get Amazon credit. Although I get a steady stream of signups from Slack and GitHub, I’m at the point now where I want to do my own marketing to grow the business faster. My plan is to start writing a lot about my own experiences and create guides for other developers that want to start businesses. My customers are developers so it seems like a nice alignment of what I can write about and an audience that’s relevant to my business. ‍",1,0
153," I was lucky enough to have a super niche market. Puppet makers also really love to talk about process and share information on materials. There’s a Facebook page called Puppet Maker’s Workshop and it just is a group for puppet makers to post photos of what they are working on, and questions they have if they get stumped. When I first launched, I posted a message there explaining I was now offering dyed fabric. About 99% of people find out about our company through this Facebook page. I started off by replying to questions, and comments about our product, but now people do that for me atomically. “Oh, you are looking for fleece? Send a message to Laurie at Puppet Pelts.” I also really love this venue because it allows me to be a “human.” If someone is working on a budget and can’t afford to use our fleece, it is important for me to let them know that puppets can be made out of anything. They don’t HAVE to be made with our fleece.  But, by being accessible, when they do have the budgets to use higher quality materials, they know where to find me. I also started running Facebook ads. What I was surprised to discover that there’s a huge number of puppet makers in Mexico that didn’t know our company existed before I started these ads. Initially, I used data collected over the past couple of years to determine which countries purchase from us the most. Our ads were then targeted to those countries. On a whim, I added Mexico to the list. While only two or three orders were shipped there, the orders we did have were large. So, I figured, “why not.” What I discovered was that once I started running Facebook ads in Mexico, it became one of the top countries for impressions and click-throughs. It also resulted in an in-studio visit from someone visiting Vegas on vacation, and a big increase in orders from Mexico made through our online shop. What I love about Facebook ads is that we can set our budget. Right now, we are spending $30 a month. It makes it really easy to reach potential customers. Another avenue I explored was partnering with puppet builders. One of our customers has a youtube channel where he teaches people how to build puppets. He approached me and asked about potentially swapping material for a shout out on his channel. We sent him a box of a range of skin tones and in exchange, he added our store to his list of supplies. It’s actually working out really well. We get a lot of hits from first-time builders who are new to the puppet world that way.",1,1
154," Growing a company turns out to be a lot harder than inventing or manufacturing a product. The key seems to be simple persistence. We pitched our chairs at trade shows, we pitched our chairs on street corners, we pitched our chairs to podcasters, we pitched our chairs to newspapers, we… Well, you get the idea. Eventually, someone hears you. Our first big success was when a piece about our chairs dropped in the Wall Street Journal. A single short article generated thousands of sales. A single brief mention of our chair as the best chair to upgrade a home office in an internal email at Google generated thousands of more sales. Now it seems to be mostly word of mouth that is selling our chairs. And we’re always looking for new partners to tell our story. For example, we’re working with a father/son team, Tim and Rick Brennan who invented Vivobarefoot shoes to find synergy between our two companies’ projects. The Vivobarefoot shoe solved the problems that restrictive shoes caused for the human foot, and our chairs address the problems caused by office chairs that restrict the human body. So, we have a lot in common with Tim and Rick, but they’ve been in the game for almost two decades, so they have a lot of experience to share with us. We’ve grown from a $100K company to a $1M company in the last two years, and we have aspirations to keep up this pace. So far it’s all been earned media and word of mouth, but we’re currently looking into paid media as a way to further awareness of active chairs as an alternative to passive sitting. ‍",1,0

I spent more than $500 initially on Facebook Advertising. The result was good and people really appreciated the idea. I also used Google Adwords and targeted some specific keywords, but the number of searches was low. That is why I skipped using Google Adwords.  I also wrote on some blogs, like FamousBloggers, in order to create buzz for the idea.

We decided to invest 2-3 weeks into the launch and go after the first place. We ended up becoming the number one product of both the day and the week, which was pretty awesome. We followed the playbook that Corey Haines and Derrick Reimer have laid out online (Derrick did a talk at MicroConf Remote, which is available for free).

163," We mainly shared Rent Nest on all the social media platforms and tried to acquire customers by rewarding them with some incentive, either money or a prize. That tactic, however, didn’t really work. Another strategy that led to many new customers was the comment and share feature our app had. People who were renting a house with another person would share their list of apartments to his/her partner and this person would need to register in order to see the list and do comments. That worked well within the segment of students. In terms of marketing, I think we missed focus and consistency. We tried content marketing, ads, etc, but we didn’t keep executing those strategies. I would have hoped we had more support from the accelerator in this field. ",0,0
164," My marketing strategy was based on short & longer-term plans. In the short term, I was heavily reliant on Google Adwords, paying to be shown when people search for keywords relating to my business. In parallel, I invested in reputable property-related advertisements that would help build my brand. Both of these are costly but if done properly can yield very positive results. In the longer term, my strategy is to ensure my site ranks well organically for my keywords. This includes writing huge amounts of property-related content, being featured on related websites & ensuring my platform is search engine friendly. In the present time, I’m moving away from my short term strategy, as Rent Round is gaining more traction on ranking well on search engines. I recall being elated when Rent Round was ranking 1st for the term ‘compare property managers’. It’s not the most searched for the term but it felt like I’d won the lottery! In terms of what has worked well and helped grow my revenue, producing well written, insightful content has been the most fruitful. Other websites are more receptive to posting your content when it adds value. This goes the distance in improving your search engine standing. As a result, the site gets more traffic and therefore conversions. It’s far from easy. Content takes hours to create and reaching out to other websites to host your content can be tricky to manage. As the brand got more familiar with agents and I invested in a redesign to improve the look of the system, the business has seen generous revenue spikes. We are seeing quarterly increases in revenue of about 20%-30%. While we’re not hitting the millions of pounds quite yet, I recouped my initial investment within the first 6 months. While the majority of agents have been pleased with our value, as you could expect with any new business, there have also been pockets of adverse feedback. This has been substantial in improving our service.  For example, in the early days, we realized a number of leads we were obtaining were actually tenants looking for a property to move into, which Rent Round doesn’t cater for.  We were then able to add clarity on our landing pages so it’s clear who the service is for. In addition, it triggered us to adjust our keyword targets so we’re more able to zone in on our key audience.  ‍",1,0
165," Since starting RepairDesk, my main focus has always been to give our customers the best. That meant the best customer service, the best features, the best whatever. Our efforts turned out to generate very positive feedback and organic growth. To that end, I believe our close connection with customers has helped immensely since we always kept an interest in the challenges and issues they faced, and how we can provide a solution for them to reach new levels of success. While our initial focus was targeting small home-based repair shops, we wanted to grow and expand and start playing with the big guns. For that, we consulted many SaaS experts, figuring out how we could provide the best service in a single platform and make it profitable. We then worked with the best I.T. professionals in our area to make improvements to RepairDesk and build on it even further. In two months, we had more than 100 repair stores that used our cloud-based POS software. That was a major win for us, being able to target all these cell phone repair shops. Still, we wanted to be better and make more improvements, so we used our knowledge and experience, along with valuable feedback, to develop our software to fit any type of repair need worldwide. I made it a point to focus squarely on maintaining great customer relationships. Talking to people was always my strong suit, and I relished in getting to know more about the people that bought RepairDesk and understanding their needs. I feel that the more you talk to a customer, the more you learn the inner workings of their circumstances. I wanted to be able to know everything that bothered them and help them find a solution for it. My desire to learn more led me to attend the Consumer Electronics Show, the world's largest tech expo, in 2019. I went to Las Vegas to attend the 'All Wireless & Prepaid Expo' and touch base with my core audience, putting a face to the name. The physical appearance at these two big shows gave us a lot of positive outreach, and we met potential customers, discussed their problems, and provided them with a quick demo of our repair shop POS software. Working with customers however wasn't the only thing that helped us. I used my people skills to also reach out for partnerships with cellphone suppliers in the market. The repair industry goes hand-in-hand with the repair parts industry, and we decided to start promotions in partnership with leading suppliers in the market. Our collaborations with MobileSentrix and Injured Gadgets boosted our customer base and resulted in many quality conversions for our business. Our team is constantly learning and experimenting with marketing strategies, figuring out how we can break new ground to reach out even more. That's the essence of SaaS-based businesses. We're now looking to add some PPC campaigns in our marketing plan and are hoping it will help RepairDesk grow even further. ",1,0

I also did some cold-calling, but had little success with that. After I secured a pilot project and some initial users, I continued meeting with other brokerages and pitching them the product. At this point, my marketing strategy was to get pilot projects at other brokerages (through emails, calls, and in person meetings), and convert the pilot projects into sales. While talking to current and potential pilot customers, it slowly became clear that there were some pretty major product issues. ‍",0,0

169," Our marketing strategy started before we built anything. We looked at competitors in the space and picked a position that would make the most sense for what we wanted to build and what our target market would resonate with. Any marketing effort we did later greatly benefited from this initial work. Overall, I think there were three primary tactics that we used to grow the business: Referral program - we give both the person giving and receiving the referral a free month of Rize. I think this system has worked exceptionally well with Rize due to its aesthetic and brand. People love sharing cool stuff with their friends and colleagues, and providing a monetary incentive behind it helped. Content creators - leveraging creators is essentially the same tactic, in principle, as the referral program but on a one-to-many relationship. We either give the creator a lifetime subscription or a sponsorship in exchange for YouTube videos, tweets, and other pieces of content that have the potential to reach our target audience. Lifetime & annual sales - revenue is much more helpful for growing your business when you get it upfront. When you're starting, earning $80 in one month is probably 100x more valuable to you than getting $100 over a year. Our cash flow is more than double that of our MRR, and because of that, we can use the money to reinvest in growth initiatives right away.",1,0

For organic traffic, we also have started digital marketing at the same time. This way, our Software’s visibility increased in Google search results. After promotion, people started signing up and started using Salonist as we provide a 14-day free trial. The interested ones have approached us and registered with the software.

171," Our initial marketing and sales strategy were pretty straightforward. We started off by catering to SMBs. Our marketing strategy was inbound, since this ensures less customer education and quicker conversions. Our problem-product fit was well-oiled.  We focussed on building organic growth via SEO and simple, easy to understand content copy on our website, blog, etc. We also dig deep into geo-marketing targeting specific geographies that were more suited as our client.  Our customer support is one of our key offerings and it has proven to be particularly advantageous for our growth. One tactic that didn’t really work out for us was going after the mid-market and enterprise customers, too soon. After receiving considerable traction for SMBs, we started hitting the mid-market and enterprise customers but our product was just not ready then. And our ‘enterprisy’ copy overwhelmed SMBs, and scared them away too. But we soon realized this and reverted to what we knew the best and it has been amazing ever since.",1,0
172," This is a hard question. I believe that there’s a ton of luck in things, but I’d say that three things contributed: “I got a guy” channel: I’ve worked with many other marketing consultants and when a business tells them they want to carry out a postcard marketing campaign, they generally send them my way. Also, from marketing slack channels.(Programmatic) SEO: We’ve lately been focused a lot on SEO, particularly creating programmatic pages in different areas. For example, we have a glossary page which we launched a few weeks ago and now accounts for 4% of our traffic. We are also building a postcard example collection where we rate them and break them down. Lastly, we’re currently converting a spreadsheet we have found with a lot of information on solar installer companies in the US into different pages and we aim to rank when people Google these companies. This is just a public spreadsheet that I’m turning into pages. Plus, we have a YouTube channel, blog, a ton of postcard examples, and a glossary.Email: The key here is pain based targeting. I send really personalized emails with information about their company and calculations I do based on data I have. I saw a 22% positive reply rate. April 2020 was a great month for Scout.

He and the early team would regularly contact developer blogs for tutorials, and sponsor developer blogs and Youtube channels to spread the word about the tool. They also started our affiliate program. We had mostly relied on blog posts for new visitors and organic traffic. The early team had started to see traction with a blog post explaining the types of companies that use web scrapers. This continued with top-10 lists about different aspects of web scraping.  Now, we are prioritizing improving our marketing strategy - with help from outside contractors and further investment made in SEO, we hope that by reworking our website, we will create more unique pages that draw people in, and improve user experience. ‍",1,0
174," Our strategy came down to this: we knew web scraping and the developer’s ""world"" very well, so let’s talk to them about web scraping. Of course, in the beginning, we posted ScrapingBee on dozens of startup listing website, but our core strategy was this. We put CTA on both our blog to redirect traffic to ScrapingBee and also wrote 3 very (from our point of view) successful piece of content, with each having more than 10,000 views: A small tutorial on how to scrape single page applicationAn extensive general guide about web scraping without getting blockedA complete introduction to web scraping with Python We don't believe in content marketing for the sake of content marketing. Sure it is easy to write or pay someone to do it for you, three pieces of content per week that nobody reads but that Google will love. We did not want to do that, we really believed we could teach something to our readers, and hopefully sell them ScrapingBee. This is why we almost spent 30 hours per article every time, it is time-consuming, but we think it is well worth it as it creates improves our SEO, brings huge traffic and builds our community.  One company we think that does it very well is Ahref. Of course, they have the resources to do those kinds of posts almost two times per week, but if you read their blog you will learn a lot about SEO, it is actually interesting and insightful content, not just marketing nonsense. We did not have the money to do Facebook or Google Ads, and if you type web scraping in Google and count the number of advertisements you can imagine how high the cost per click might be there. Instead, we massively discuss web scraping on Facebook, Reddit, Dev.to, Hacker News, and some more niche forums. We don't always bring up ScrapingBee, but when we do, it converts pretty well. ",1,0
175," We have worked with influencers on Instagram and are keen to do more. Our collaboration with Sammi Jefcoate, brought us many more followers and sales of our Starburst Hoop Earrings and Opal Huggies, that she wore in her Instagram posts. We have also worked with other Instagrammers, which seems to have gained us followers and traffic, but not all of the effort put in can be seen in sales for each and every post. We also found that one of our blog posts about the #curatedear drove lots of US traffic to our site, so we will be writing more niche blogs about jewellery styling. We have grown the trade side of the business substantially, by doing the trade show circuit in London, and every trade customer has now re-ordered, which we find really encouraging. And this helps drive awareness of the brand, and people who purchase a Scream Pretty item, often have a look at our website, but have the luxury of touching the item, when they buy it from a boutique! We have found that curated, London fashion boutiques have just the right ‘Scream Pretty’ customers - which makes us think we should be looking at a similar type of store in New York next year perhaps…. Facebook adverts - so far have not really worked for us - perhaps we haven't found the right ‘audience’, but we will keep trying. ‍",1,1
176," We did a lot of marketing efforts after our first MVP launch. I wish we had started doing them earlier. For us, SEO and content marketing works best we ranked pretty well for a bunch of our target keywords and managed to get a lot of backlinks over the years: The most successful link-building strategy was to give away for free our top-tier subscription to bloggers and influencers in exchange for Seomator mention. It worked pretty well. Another interesting thing was when we launched an affiliate program. It didn't bring us a lot of paying customers but it significantly helped us with link building. We run our affiliate program on Tapfiliate, a very flexible affiliate management platform suitable for SaaS recurring payments that also easily integrates with our payment processing provider. We’ve also tried advertising on social media and Google AdWords, but the cost of acquisition was too high for us.  It’s worth mentioning that along the road, we’ve built a few side projects to support our SEO, most notably Curatedseotools, a list of the best SEO tools, which was a big success at ProductHunt back in the day: The most important thing is that since our marketing strategy is built mostly on SEO efforts, our current monthly marketing expenses are very low and our user acquisition cost is near $0.  With all that efforts we have about 600-700 leads each month, with conversion to trials near 10%.",1,0
177," The first year was incredible! It went from strength to strength. At one point I was making more money in a day than my dad could in a month. It was crazy.                                       I built a few social games inspired by games I had enjoyed in my earlier years. Facebook was creating a new market of gamers who had never played ""proper"" games before. Text-based games were a whole new world to them. The biggest hit we had was a city building simulator called Metropolis. At the end of the first year, we had revenues of $60-$80k per month. Regarding marketing, I was not great at marketing. I did not need to be. The games were compelling enough, and Facebook was a platform for discovery and engagement. Just by being on Facebook, we gained significant traction. It got me believing that “if you build they will come”. My later experiences and the book Traction by Gabriel Weinberg disprove this saying.",0,0
178," Being a beginner in marketing/communication, I’ve been focused on the only thing I know which is content writing, and have tried to write as much as I can about the findings when working on SimpleLogin or technical challenges. These posts are quite technical and targeted at tech-savvy people. In the beginning, I posted on dev.to (a developer-focus blogging platform), then I moved to our own blog. Some users suggested we get in touch with “influencers” in the field of online privacy. I did and SimpleLogin received highly positive reviews from Techlore (100K subscribers on Youtube), Michael Bazzell (author on security/privacy books), etc. These podcasts, videos, or blog posts generated traction and we can see the traffic peaking at the publication.  Currently, we are experimenting with a referral program. The result seems promising. We don’t have any traction when launching a Hacker News show post - I don’t have any explanation because similar products have acquired a lot of interest from this community in the past. I guess the timing of the post matters a lot and my advice is to make sure to delete your post immediately when you don’t see any upvote in the next 15-30 minutes. This way you can choose another moment to launch. We plan to launch on Product Hunt soon. Hopefully, it’s going to be better than the HN one.",1,0
179," Word of mouth has been the main channel since the beginning. People were happy. Churn is only around 3%. Also, word of mouth is a great way to filter toxic people, since your community is the one that makes it grow, they chose only to tell people that will be adding value to it, not subtracting it. I’ve been participating in a lot of events and talk about SinOficina everywhere. People identify your passion and connect with the project’s mission and values. Growth has been pretty linear. There hasn't been yet a channel that gave us exponential growth but we are still experimenting. Also, exponential growth may not be what you want if your business is a community. Sometimes it is better to grow slow but sustained. ‍",1,0
180," For SnapShooter, we’ve seen tremendous growth when focusing on word of mouth, referrals, and organic SEO. Over the last year, we’ve focused on writing great content and sharing lots of information about SnapShooter across our blog and social media. We plan to expand that content in the next year, covering more than just backups. The challenge is that Google’s algorithms are constantly changing, and it takes work to keep ranking well on some of the keywords we’ve pushed to be ranked highly on.  We have also started building partnerships and relationships with service providers and hosting companies. We see this as a valuable opportunity to reach even more people and help those companies with a service that could take up a lot of their time and effort internally.  ‍",1,0
181," When you look at the template above, you’ll see that one of the things I tested during the pre-sell phase were distribution channels. Not only did I want to test that people would buy the newsletter, but I also wanted to make sure that I could reach them. To do this, I made experiments on multiple different channels. I posted a free, proof-of-concept version of my newsletter to Indie Hackers, Reddit, and Twitter. That’s how I found the original 33 qualified leads for pre-sales. You can see that original post on Indie Hackers here. Since then, Twitter and Indie Hackers have been the two best channels for me, but they take a lot of work. In both places, my goal is to create high-quality content that really helps fellow founders in getting to the same stage I’m at. On Indie Hackers, I’ve also publicly shared my numbers through the Milestones section, which people have found interesting. I’m still nailing down my Twitter strategy, but it basically falls along the same lines. Now, I’m looking for my next distribution channel. I’m exploring a number of opportunities, just like I did the first time, and hopefully I’ll find one or two more that reliably bring in new customers. Two channels that I’m looking at very seriously are newsletter sponsorships and SEO, but I won’t know what works until my experiments with them are complete at the end of the month. ‍",1,0
182," We grew mostly through Facebook advertising. We’d promote blog posts about how players were performing, and we developed a ‘Power Ranking’ which gave an idea of which players would do best that weekend based on how they were performing individually, as well as their team's performance and oppositions. These proved really popular, along with player comparisons. When big teams were playing each other such as Liverpool vs Man City, we’d pick out 2 key players, highlight some key stats and asked people who they thought would score the most points that weekend. We also got a load of good feedback on various forums which contributed to some OK organic growth. One thing that really helped was launching in an industry that people are super passionate about - football. People loved the stats we were throwing out on social and were always happy to chip in with comments of their own.  We got to about 1,000 users, of which about 50% played weekly across different games, with the average monthly spend peaking for us at just under £30. ",0,0
183," We are mainly focusing on the digital side of the advertising spectrum. Before going live with our Kickstarter we focused on creating a newsletter mailing list by utilizing Instagram to attract potential backers with an enticing reward. During the campaign, we were able to use influencers, some small press outlets, and Facebook ads to drive our funding. Now that we are at the stage where we are officially launched, we are still utilizing social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest with good results. We are also creating a social media campaign with a number of influencers to help push our sales, for not too much cost, and are utilizing some large and small press outlets to also help tell our story. Facebook ads will also continue, with a focus on finding our target market through multiple campaigns and doubling down on the ads that work the best. On top of this, we also have plans to really push our content marketing pipelines with a new journal we will be introducing. Our focus on this journal is not to try to sell a product directly, but to work with other well-known individuals in related industries to bring together people, ideas, and inspirations to help people focus on simplifying and cutting out all of the ‘fat’ in their lives to help them focus and pursue their true passions. We hope that this journal can be used in a way that will make people wanting to come back to read the most recent story, and not just be another ad.",1,0
184," Most of our marketing consists of creating educational content, whatever the format is (podcasts, blog posts, tools). We’re also active within the community of people that we serve, compared to other people that just participate there when they have something to promote. I think that’s something many people miss. Only if you’re a helpful citizen, people are going to look you up, join your email newsletter and end up buying one or multiple of your products. My Indie Hackers profile is the best example of this. We’ve also experimented with paid ads last year, but we had mediocre results. The 30x500 course is mainly promoted when we open enrollment  once every quarter of the year, exclusively through our newsletter and waiting list.",1,0
185," Standuply was featured on the main page of the Slack App Directory in March 2017. In two weeks we got 750 new signups and reached a milestone of 1,000 teams. Even since the feature ended we have still been getting a steady stream of new users from Slack.  We relied heavily on content marketing in 2017 and continue to do so today. I published several long reads. It helped us to improve our SEO and led decent traffic to our blog. My posts received hundreds of thousands of views since then. We launched Standuply and related Slack bot products many times on Product Hunt in the latest two years. At first, it was our initial launch that brought in our very first users. Next launches brought more users on board. We also spread the news about Standuply, Slack bots and our blog posts on Facebook, Twitter, Hacker News, Reddit and on smaller sites. In all, that has brought us dozens of thousands of visitors in the last two years. Also, we had a booth at three conferences in 2017: Chatbot Summit in Berlin, Slush in Helsinki and TechCrunch Disrupt in Berlin. But, as a result, we had at maximum the same amount of signups from the three conferences as on a regular day with zero marketing budget. However, seeing how people react to a message on our roll-up is very insightful. ",1,0
186," We’re a product-led company, so we’ve opted for a “land-and-expand” marketing strategy where we acquire one user and then expand from there throughout a team.  With a bottom-up growth approach, you first need to sell the individual value and benefits of the product. A lot of our marketing efforts at the moment are focused on pitching this individual value proposition. We rely on B2C channels to acquire those leads, such as app directories, blog posts, and our social media.  With our previous product, we had two channels that worked especially well: ProductHunt (early adopter platform) and product reviews (spontaneous, non-paid).  As of now, we have not spent any money on advertising. Outside the B2C channels mentioned, we are essentially growing through word-of-mouth.  ‍",1,0
187," The marketing power of chefs really can’t be underestimated. Known for their frankness, their endorsements carry huge weight. That’s why we set out to align Stone with the very best in the game - Pierre Koffmann, Marcus Wareing, Matt Abe. And thanks to the strong existing relationships and bit of string-pulling, we could make that happen. With these names on board, we had a great reach not just within the industry but also out to the public too. We had a nice amount of press coverage when the Classic Stone first launched which certainly helped our marketing efforts but chef endorsements have been key in the long term.   Food influencers have been a big pull too. Writers, food stylists and recipe bloggers have all been happy to post about us and I’ve been really pleased with how authentic those posts feel. We’re not selling chocolate bars or 2 grand sunglasses. The Stone range is designed to be genuinely useful and a lot of our marketing focuses on that.  We’ve had good traction on our own socials too.  We’ve got some great photographers and videographers in the Stone team and we’ve put together some really good content that has drawn us a strong following. In fact, for a while, Instagram was our biggest source of new customers. I’m a designer at heart so I want all our channels to match what Stone is all about - simple, beautiful design.   And now we’re veering away from overtly promotional material and focussing on high production collaborations with top chefs. Our latest video series ‘Written in Stone’ sees great chefs talk about one dish or ingredient and has proved a big hit with followers old and new. It’s kind of the dream method for us - low cost and really effective.  At no point since we launched have we hit a lull with sales. The initial excitement in what was seen as an innovative product has died down, and getting people to talk about us when we are now considered established in the industry is increasingly difficult. However we have found our feet with ad spend, learning about our audience and refining who we target, and because we are ultimately selling a good product we are getting return custom.  My basis of comparison is limited but I think there are consumer brands that get a higher customer satisfaction than us. We never have to go through social and delete negative comments. We just don’t get them, well, certainly not about the product anyway. So I believe we are at a really healthy juncture. We have the foundations right, the principles of the product right and we think we understand the audience. So we are now ready to make the next steps in the business. ",1,0
188,"  Strength Running has relied heavily on organic traffic from search engines, social media, and other sites. Primarily, our biggest source is organic traffic because we have focused so heavily on our blog content.  I’ve also built relationships with other large sites and blogs and contribute to Runner’s World, PodiumRunner, the MapMyRun blog, Lifehacker, The Art of Manliness, and others.   Social media plays a smaller role and is better for building relationships and connecting with your community.  ",1,0
189," Our marketing is still very bare-bones. We're thinking of hiring someone to help me do marketing, but we're still riding the wave of word of mouth. We just do a very good job with our clients and they grow the business for us. The website has improved a lot since the start, though. Social media helps but to an extent. There are accounts in our niche with 100k followers but are only helping a few people. We have around 35k followers and have helped even more than that.  We have also tried some ads on Facebook but it didn’t really work. In our industry, marketing is more about brand awareness than selling right on the spot. It's hard to sell a multi-hundred dollar service with an ad. Word of mouth is, in the end, what has allowed us to grow to a 70 person staff and 40,000 customers. I think the reason it has worked so well is because of how badly the nutrition industry is failing people. People are really sick of not getting the results they are supposed to get from other diets. We fix that. For good. The dieting industry is a multi-billion dollar industry and it is doing a crappy job. It can help you lose fat, but it doesn't help you change behaviors. It doesn't give you strategies, it just gives you some rules that you have to follow, and if you don't, you don't get results. We're very flexible in that way our approach is to meet people where they are and just try to help them on an individual level without all the nonsense. Pricing the service has been one of the hardest things for me as we grew. We obviously needed to charge more, not only because we’d got better at what we do but also due to the increasing costs of running the business. We had to charge more in order to hire more people, grow,  and improve. But not too much where nobody wanted to work with us. So that has been a really delicate balance. ‍",1,0
190," Early Google Ads, leveraging that to get some customers, making sure those customers have the best experience possible and then telling others about it. There’s an inherent virality to what we do because our finished products are out in the world, gifted to people. Recipients always want to know where they came from, which leads back to us. It’s a solid viral loop that continues to propel the business. You just need to make sure at the same time you are investing in the existing customer experience so they retain and expand.  We never really dug into social media and social ads. Facebook Ads testing early on brought a lot of low-quality leads so we ignored it. Sometimes there’s a temptation to do everything, but you can only focus on so much. Test channels but double down on ones working.  Later on, I started to personally get active on Twitter which I think has helped us build a strong community around the brand. The first few months, revenue was pretty low, sub $5k, but it was something, especially given no one knew who we were and we didn’t have much to speak of at that point. We got early inbound leads from startups like Soylent which was very encouraging, as it proved people were likely looking for a better way. After that first order for packs, which was for about $10k, and then our subsequent positioning as a swag pack company, we saw growth take off. The next month we did about $40k and never looked back. I’m a huge fan of Purple Cow thinking and it was clear we had turned ourselves into a purple cow at that point ‍",1,0
191," Our user and retention rates kept on growing. We were doing well on App Store Keyword optimization and content marketing. But the thing that was making it work was that people loved the product. Releasing the long-awaited version for Android and crossing half a million users. Swipes was hot. Media was writing about it, Apple featured us multiple times on their App Store banners and lists. We had success, but we were still not a business. Looking back, our biggest challenge was building a sustainable monetization model. We were only thinking about growth - the faster the better. We firstly tried a subscription model, but conversation rates were really low. It was 2015 and people weren’t really keen to pay money every month to use apps. So we moved to another monetization strategy that was far more challenging: team collaboration.  This way, we got into an odyssey of constant R&D and rework that defined the following 4 years. ‍",0,0
192," From the very beginning we did whatever it took to get eyes on our product. In the early days we applied large Swoop stickers on the vehicles and pulled up to events around town to show them off. We handed out flyers with promo codes and even gave some free rides to larger groups. This worked well to get our name out in the community but didn’t really translate to consistent sales. Next we partnered with bars and restaurants during football season and offered package deals that would provide roundtrip transportation to and from the Rams games. This got more bodies in the vehicles and also led to great advertisement but it just wasn’t enough. As a little more time went on we focused heavily on our social media presence. We had a service that was perfect for influencers to get on board with. We provided free rides in exchange for social posts which expanded our following from around 500 to over 10k in the matter of a few months. By then our branding was on point. Everyone knew what a party bus, limo, and charter bus was, but we incorporated it into their daily lives and made it more relatable. We began to see a heavy increase in web traffic and overall engagement. In order to capitalize on the marketing progress we created, our business development team strapped on their boots to create more opportunities. Peter and Ruben who led these efforts pitched Swoop to become the preferred transportation partner at some of the best wedding venues in LA. This led to some cross-marketing through websites like Wedding Wire and The Knot which spawned into more partnerships at new venues. We then created a wedding planner referral program to provide a commission for suggesting our services. The wedding industry soon became our largest revenue stream. As our ride total grew we stuck to our main goal of always providing a five-star service. This increased our popularity on Yelp which led to more sales because our product had great reviews and lots of them. Simply put, we got dirty at first and did everything we could to become recognizable. After establishing our brand, we grew with the resources around us and kept pace with the culture of the markets we were in. Once we got you in a Swoop, it was game over. Nowadays we've been experimenting a lot. Direct outreach, sales and relationship management have shown the greatest impact. We're leveraging Apollo.io for email outreaches, and Alfred.io on LinkedIn Sales Navigator. In terms of marketing, the leads on paid social sites like Instagram and Facebook turned out to be too expensive. We tried a lot on Google Ads but only got cost-efficient results for specific target audiences. Today we are leveraging our SEO strongly by building backlinks and content marketing. You don't see it picking up right away like on paid channels but it's an investment - you plant the seeds and watch them grow. ‍",1,0
193," For the first months, we didn’t spend any money on marketing. We spent hours manually responding to relevant threads and content on Quora, Twitter, Reddit, and Youtube. We tried to answer everywhere someone posted about saving captions, needing a transcription from Google Meet, or problems with remote meetings. We also commented on Youtube videos about Chrome extensions, meeting productivity, tools for online classes - you name it.  These tactics netted us our first 10,000 users.  Since then, we’ve grown to 190,000+ users and had success with Tik Tok influencers, posting content on Youtube, blog posts, product-led growth, and word of mouth.  We got to our first 10,000 users within months. It was a clear signal from the market that people needed our solution urgently. When you realize you’re solving a problem other people care about, it’s gratifying. ",1,0
194," When I launched Anymail Finder, I shared the link on Hacker News, which went pretty well, and soon a guy re-posted on Product Hunt.  So when it was time to launch Tailor, I just shared him the link and he published it on Product Hunt, which meant a lot of traffic. I also placed an ad on Anymail finder (which used to be called thrust.io at the time). I didn’t really know what I was doing, but around 800 people signed up.  But that’s all. I really didn’t focus on marketing, which was a big mistake. I was trying to follow that pattern of launching X products at a certain time, so I couldn’t spend a lot of time on marketing. ‍",0,0
195," As I explained before, marketing was extremely weak. I launched in Product Hunt, posted in a few aggregators… and that’s about it. Due to the competition, the app was receiving a fair bit of press local and international, but I never took many advantages of it. ‍ Product Hunt was relatively successful, however. After launching the product there, an influx of users entered the site and bumped up the stats with about 40-50 signups. It did not go high up on the board like my latest launch (Makerlog), but enough for a considerable amount of traffic. A tactic that did not work, however, is the typical attitude of “if you build it, they will come”. This does not work, and I learned it the hard way. ‍",0,0
196," We tried everything - inside sales, Google AdWords, Facebook Ads, reseller arrangements, etc. etc. - but nothing ended up working. Near the end of Tali, sales were slow and only growing about 10%-15% per month. We reached about $3,000 of monthly recurring revenue (MRR) but nothing we did on the sales and marketing side seemed to move the needle.  This was mostly driven by our target customer, which was a solo or small firm attorney. Because of this, account sizes were typically small (less than 10 users) and our price was also low ($10 - 12 per user per month), meaning our average revenue per account was $100 or less. This meant we couldn’t afford to spend a lot of money to land these smaller accounts in a profitable way, and we never ended up figuring out an efficient way to spend our sales and marketing dollars in a way that generated favorable unit economics (e.g. customer acquisition cost when compared to customer lifetime value).  ",0,0
197," We have to thank our growth to a combination of a lot of smaller strategies and channels: Building in public and sharing our startup story and milestones has helped us to gain exposure with fellow Indie Hackers and founders. Product led growth: most of our users are free users and share a Tally form with a ‘Powered by Tally’ badge on it.Referrals: we launched a startup-, educational, non-profit, and affiliate program.Community building: we built our own little community with early users and supporters that helped us to spread and promote Tally.Content marketing: we’re creating a lot of help documentation and tutorials about form building and new features.

199," We first launched the app to our pilot participants, many of whom had expressed interest in trying the app when it was ready. We also posted on relevant disease-specific forums where there would be people who take medication regularly. Since we believed our companion feature was differentiated, we also tried to target companions (e.g. young adult children or spouses of people who take medication regularly) through Google and FB ads, and built a simple web setup flow so that they could get the app entirely set up for their loved one. We were able to get several hundred users through these techniques in the first few weeks, but found paid acquisition cost-prohibitive, given the app was free, and didn't have a deterministic way of continuing to grow our user base. We explored the possibility of primary care physicians or nurses recommending or even setting the app up for their patients, but the doctors we contacted told us they wouldn't have the time to do so. ‍",0,0
200," We didn't do too much in terms of finding students. We didn't do too much outbound marketing. We had blog content. I think we crept up on Google search. Someone searching German teacher in Berlin would probably find us in the top listings. We never had problems finding students. In terms of teachers, my partner spent a lot of time on message boards for expats in different cities posting, looking for people posting about being teachers, and posting about work. We would go to other teacher listing sites, contact people through there, and try to recruit them. It was a lot of hustle looking around anywhere where expats or language teachers were congregated online, and just messaging them finding out if they had availability, and convincing them to sign up. ‍",0,0

I started with showing a few paper sketches and “pitching” the idea to the HR manager of the company I was employed at that time. Then, I also reached out to all my LinkedIn connections and asked for introductions to people they knew from HR industry. As a result, I’ve got a list of a bit more than 10 great people that were super helpful and were willing to be a part of my pilot group. Lots of user research, lots of thinking, lots of doing, lots of testing and iterating. Rinse and repeat. As for the marketing strategies, we were still working with the pilot group of people when we decided to shut it down.

202," We were counting on inbound marketing to drive demand. We were moderately successful with that (thus the 100+ free trials). But that was a super naive strategy for the type of business we were running. Circa 2011, when this happened, SaaS was really not that much of a thing, especially in Brazil and in the B2B environment. Looking back, it was very obvious that we should have some sort of consulting style sales to help HR folks to see the value of the software. How did we get the inbound traffic? Basically by writing one article per day about stuff related to team building and development. This was force bruting SEO at its best. At the time it worked to bring the leads. Since I had a marketing and HR background and enjoyed writing, it was “easy” to research a few related keywords, look at competitors and write something better. Soon we jumped to the first top 5 spots in lots of those keywords. 2011 was also simpler days in terms of SEO professionals. Of course, this whole effort and traffic were wasted because 1) we were not able to convert free trials into paid users and 2) we were not talking to those people to understand why they were not converting. This was a very amateuristic product development mistake from my part. One thing that was insane is that we “focused” on both the Brazilian and English speaking markets, so we had 2 articles per day, one in English and one in Portuguese. This made no sense, we should have focused on our own reality (Brazil) and later expanded our reach if things worked. ‍",0,0
203," To start the business, I decided to offer a two-week free trial to members so they could get a feel of the program, and also because people tend to love free trials! During the two-week free trial, the customer would receive automated emails on how to grow their real estate business, how to create business pages, how to target their chosen audience, I would often and more. We wanted people to feel like they were getting value in addition to getting content. The Agent Nest received its first trial on January 6th of 2020, and I was so excited! It was a former client of mine from Morealty Marketing. By the end of January, I had 7 paying customers, and my MRR was $145. In February I started posting on my Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest more often, I created a real estate Facebook group that pertained to social media, and I started running my first ads through Facebook and Google. I didn’t have that big of a marketing budget during this time, so, of course, I was spending more than I was making, which is OKAY. By the end of February, I had 17 members total, and my MRR was $430. I was so excited that I almost tripled my MRR from the previous month, but, at the same time, I tend to be hard on myself. I have always been the kind of person who wants everything to be perfect who wants to be THE BEST. Can you believe after two months I was already putting THIS much pressure on myself? Sometimes it hindered me more than it helped, but it did make me more determined. In March of 2020, I continued my marketing strategies from February since it seemed to work, but also during this time I changed the 14 days free trial to a 30-day free trial. I then created a Facebook ad for this promotion with a $400 budget for the month. The Facebook ad was successful. By the end of March, I had 122 30-day trial sign-ups, and my MRR was $517. Then, in April, my MRR shot up to $2,443, and I had a 65% trial conversion rate. To continue the growth of The Agent Nest, I began running ads on my Pinterest after I created different boards about real estate marketing with my content on there. I still pay around $75/month for Pinterest ads and average 90,000 page views per month. I have also hosted real estate webinars on a wide range of topics and advertise them on Facebook Groups, pages, and ads. In August of 2020, I got invited to be interviewed on the Podcast “Getting your Real Estate Life Together” and had a blast. I’m always open for more Podcast interviews! ‍",1,1
204," We tried different strategies to get the word out. Most of the things we did initially weren’t successful. For example, we ran ads in newspapers. But eventually, we learned that people aren’t looking for home care when they read the news. Then we tried direct sales by leaving business cards on the doorsteps of seniors. But our messaging was off.  Eventually, we shifted our marketing efforts to our web presence and digital marketing. And it’s worked. We realized that our business isn’t something that you buy while browsing around or because you happen to land on an advertisement by chance. Instead, it’s like a plumber’s. You need it when you need it. Outside of that time period, you’re not looking for it.  Our primary drivers of growth now are PPC, content marketing, and social media. We got traction right away with Google Ads. It took about 6 months to start to see some results from SEO and inbound marketing.   ‍",1,0
205," Our strategy was simple. Approach the existing gaming clubs, find out their needs and fill them. Offer the local ones a new location to run their meetups and events. Once we had that ball rolling there, we moved onto more consistent social media advertising which always worked for us. Our biggest generator (as for most business’) was word of mouth. We made sure to always have time for our customers, this really helped with word of mouth as we became the store that had staff that was interested in interacting with people. We utilized multiple different websites to advertise events, local “things to do” guides and websites like Eventbrite. We didn’t always sell tickets online, but it always generated traffic. ‍",0,0
206," Publicity was another challenge as we had wasted much of our resources. We were only hoping to get traction either via newspaper inserts or Zomato AD inserts. Additionally, we created some banner stands for placements on corporates who had started taking our products. These are some of the marketing strategies we carried out: Mass emailing: It obviously didn’t work.Newspaper inserts: They didn’t work.Our AD on Zomato brought some customers, but the ROI was not justified. We ran lots of campaigns making permutations and combinations with various categories under the Zomato platform for a year, but the results were still not justifying the costs.Facebook Ads didn’t work. We did get likes but they did not convert into customers. Within the first year, we reached 9K likes on our page.We invested the most on food bloggers by sampling them free food to ask for genuine reviews and ratings on Zomato platform. This definitely worked for us in spreading the word around. Within the first year, we had reached 4.3 rating out of 5 on Zomato. ‍",0,0
207," I was working with Alexander Isora who made The Unicorn Platform and successfully maintains it as his main job. He shared some useful insights and connections to help my product gain the initial momentum when it launched. He was the one who taught me how to launch properly. I used what I learned from his tactics and it worked perfectly with what I built before. I was aware that Thepresence is a niche product and shouldn’t be targeted to the general audience. I wasn’t trying to change the whole industry, I just wanted to build the first project that I could monetize. You can’t truly focus when you’re trying to satisfy everyone. So instead of doing that, I decided to focus on a small but loyal auditory and its needs. I wasn’t looking to build a Squarespace killer but a product that my auditory wanted to stay with. I wanted it to be shared among their friends as an insight, a tool that isn’t for everyone. For the pricing, I decided to pick a market average value of $28 a month. Not so cheap that it doesn’t feel premium but not so expensive that it raises expectations that the product is unable to meet. ‍",0,0
208," We never really had an issue with attracting customers or press. We were on national TV shows (including GMA, if I remember correctly) before the SharkTank appearance even. I think that everyone could see the idea had potential. Really it was a matter of contacting the right people - once they heard the idea they were on board. I am not the marketing guy, so I can’t really get into the nuts and bolts of that side of it.",0,0
209," I’d say there are not many secrets to growth. Combining techniques and doing it the right way by paying attention to details and knowing what you do is key. I’ve always been good at multitasking, and quick growth, to me, means combining many channels, then focus on the ones that work for your business. My main idea though as always trying to create a strong brand, and it has a lot to do with growth. People need to be emotionally attached to what I create. Long term, it decreases marketing costs, increases retention and organic growth. Online Marketing (SEO, Adwords, Blog, Content creation) Find out who your target is, what keywords they’re looking for when they have the pain points you’re trying to solve. Address these pain points through blog articles, short sentences for SEO and ads, etc. Establish your credibility by sending these in newsletters or on social media. ‍ Direct sales: Almost everything can be automated or outsourced nowadays. But when I started I did learn by doing all of it myself. Although I hadn’t realized how important it was to start with a good list of leads. Talking to salespeople I quickly came up with ideas on how to automate SDR, Follow up and Sales pitch. Constant email tweaks, A/B testing and looking at opening rates/conversion rate is key.   Product growth: Just think about ways your users can recommend you or add gamification for stickiness and make your users feel great about your product. Then when you make them feel great, invite them to talk about your product to someone else! I always use the Candy crush example. People love playing it because they feel great about themselves when they’re playing it. It’s fairly easy but challenging sometimes, and most and foremost, you get animations and congratulations for almost everything you’re doing. The game keeps praising your actions! I also like to make others laugh or feel good about themselves so the notifications in Trackin are pretty funny and different from what you would read in standard SAAS.  Getting a sense of self-improvement, especially regarding sales was amazing. Finding the right introductory sentence to get to talk to a manager and by-pass employees, being aware of what to answer based on questions, being able to read people concerns, see their reactions to the features we knew they would love...were all great feelings. Today with MobyDish, I love to hear customers from Silicon Valley (used to deal with the best products) how they enjoy working with us VS companies like Doordash, Caviar or others. Because these companies have raised millions and are hundreds, when we’re super small, profitable and mainly backed by angels, and still being the company they like most. Another funny fact is that some of the biggest VCs in Silicon Valley that have invested in these food companies, are using MobyDish to feed themselves :) ‍",1,0
210," We have a 5-Step Growth Marketing Framework that we use for our clients. And, we treat Tuff as a client.  It’s pretty simple and the theme is rapid experimentation. The framework lives in a Google Sheet and it helps us prioritize high-impact growth campaigns to quickly drive R.O.I. and key learnings, then invest in additional campaigns to scale up what works.  We start with foundation research. Then, list out as many growth tactics (paid, affiliate, content, events, pr, partnerships, etc) as we can be based on what we’re trying to achieve, select experiments based on impact, and then execute the campaigns. From there, we analyze the data and repeat it.  We test 3-5 new experiments per month for Tuff (we sponsored the Failory this month - this was one of our experiments!). If you want access to Tuff’s Growth Marketing tactics spreadsheet, reach out and I’ll walk you through it.  ‍",1,1
211," We did a lot of stuff. Our first launch happened through our Twitter accounts and in a few subreddits. We were also leveraging the email list we had built from previous products we made. Then we started making free side products and resources that we launched on Product Hunt. Doing this helped us reach $5K MRR within 3 months. And then we partnered up with JK Molina, a pretty well-known tweet writing and Twitter growth expert with a nice audience around that topic. He loved the product and wanted to join us, and we were happy to welcome him as a part-owner of the product. He launched toward his audience, and in a matter of weeks, we tripled our MRR. At that point, we had also developed a lot of new features like scheduling, automations, and other core features for people who want to grow on Twitter. We had also raised our prices to what they are today. In the past month, our growth has mainly been organic. We like to do “eventful” stuff, so we organized a Twitter growth contest, a Twitter growth conference, and a few more things like that to stay top of mind whenever someone thinks about using a Twitter tool. ‍",1,0
212," We failed to understand how important it is to have marketing strategies and build an audience around Twitch Highlights. Yes, we tried sending cold emails, post on forums and Reddit. But it’s hard to get anyone attention this way for a brand new product when no one knows you. ‍",0,0
213," Most of the time we are working on the product.  I’m interested in growing our MRR and user base, but our top priority will always be the product. I’m a fanatic. My passion is the product. And I want to continue shaping it.  I do not feel like I want to spend much time on promoting Unicorn Platform. Instead, I believe a good service can grow by itself. I will talk about it in the next chapter of this interview. Nevertheless, I regularly discover new marketing channels.  My current bet is side-project marketing. I believe I can bring value by building something useful for startup folks and therefore drive attention to Unicorn Platform.  My current side-project which I’m evolving is Broadwise.org. Broadwise.org is an old school online forum for discussing tech, design, marketing and other startup-related topics. I believe in the subforums-based form of communication and have big plans for the project. Welcome! 😁 ‍",1,0
214," From the start, we focused on content marketing. Our ICPs (ideal customer profiles) consist mainly of early staged founders or product managers. Both are keen on learning new things. So by providing content that could help them build a better product, we could convince them to use a tool like Upvoty because, as we experienced first hand, manually documenting all the feedback and requests isn’t sustainable and requires a lot of time and work. We also launched a couple of ebooks, did a lot of interviews, sponsored some podcast shows, and of course, I promoted Upvoty to my audience on YouTube. But, the best marketing strategy was our product. Not because it’s a fantastic product (at least, we think so), but because we’ve added a ‘Powered by Upvoty’ mention and link in our feedback portal. We get referrals from our own product because the customers of our customers also want to use such feedback software. Every time our customers share their Upvoty feedback portal or boards, new potential customers see our name. If they need a feedback tool themselves, they will click through, sign up for a trial, and stick around. ",1,0
215," We officially launched our first masterclass Zero to Radio Ready at the start of 2018 with a brand new sales page. Our initial marketing strategy was to funnel users through Robin's existing website with ads on his site and to promote the masterclass in his email funnels. Those users would hit the sales page and that would trigger retargeting ads on Facebook. This strategy kinda worked as the audience that came from Robin's site were not complete cold and were somewhat familiar with his face. Long story short. We tried a lot of different things and none of them took off. Our biggest roadblock was that we couldn't find a way to get more students. Most Hip-Hop and R&B artists don't necessarily have a place online where they like to hang out. And we didn't have cash in hand for paid acquisition. Here are some the other things we tried for Zero to Radio Ready: Some artists voiced that the pricing was too high. So we started playing with pricing, but not until we charged below $50 did we see a bit of an increase.We tested a monthly subscription plan of $10 but that resulted in a lot of tire kickers. People who'd join, absorb the content and immediately cancel their plan again.We added 30-day money back guarantee which backfired and our refund rate increased.I cold emailed YouTube channels that sell beats and asked if they wanted to be an affiliate. I managed to get a lot of producers on-board as it's a logical up-sell to their audience. But the traffic barely converted.We wrote several blog posts for artists. But came to a conclusion that artists don't Google their struggles as much.We tried an evergreen email funnel with a discount that will expire.Plus much more, trust me. Beyond these issues, we were still paying $99/month for Teachable. And that was something my brain couldn't handle. So I decided to create the course platform myself in WordPress from scratch. For the WordPress geeks out there 🤓... I ditched the page builder and 3rd party theme and decided to use WooCommerce and WooCommerce memberships to handle the transactions and content restriction. For our custom theme, I used the Tonik WordPress Starter Theme and Bedrock for the WordPress boilerplate. I'm using advanced custom fields and two custom post types course/lesson that work together. ‍",1,0
216," What worked: reaching out to clients that we genuinely wanted to work with. Doing the best job we could for those clients, so they’d work with us again, or tell a friend/colleague. Doing that about 300-times over. What didn’t: offering free videos. No one trusted us at the beginning, even though we honestly were just trying to get a portfolio to show that Evan and I could make high-quality videos.  We worked with some big name clients like Koala and Square, where the work got seen on national TV campaigns in the US and Australia. It pretty much solved the credibility/trust concern each new client had in one-shot. The work was also so widely seen that most new prospects had seen the videos too, which helped. We couldn’t have ever started with these clients, but it would seem you do have to keep working your way up until a very high leverage opportunity presents itself those projects were good examples. For me, it felt validating. If you can do work at that level a few years into your professional career, it felt like I was on the right track, and that there was substance to all the thoughts I had around whether the company was going in the right direction. Revenue has grown steadily, and it’s been reflecting nicely in the size of our team growth (we’re completely bootstrapped). Year 1: Myself and Evan.  Year 2: 1 employee. Year 3: 4 employees. Year 4: 9 employees. Year 5: Will be 23 employees in May. ‍",1,0
217," To build a tech start-up you need to invest funds upfront, and it takes months – if not years – to start earning from the solution you develop. Most of the early-stage funding is channeled to product development with little left over to spend on marketing. Viewst was no exception, but that said, spending on advertising before being sure of your product/market fit, isn’t prudent. ‍ We therefore literally reached out to our first potential users in person while simultaneously starting to share updates on our social media channels, like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram. We set up a bunch of analytical tools such as Amplitude, and Google analytics, and used a CRM system to track the results. The first few metrics we concentrated on were DAU (daily active users), WAU (weekly active users), MAU (monthly active users), the retention rate, and the sources of our website traffic. The first wave of interest was fuelled by several articles about Viewst. With this, we realized the power of public relations, but as a rule, we don’t pay for PR, while clearly understanding the importance of being in the spotlight for momentous reasons. The second wave of enthusiasm was fuelled by our launch on Product Hunt, a well-known website that curates a selection of early-stage start-ups’ solutions for tech lovers and other makers. We went live on PH 8 months after our public launch. At that stage, Viewst was still extremely basic and could only solve certain, simple ad-production needs. We didn’t reach our desired audience, but the campaign helped us to spread the word about Viewst and prompted tweets and re-tweets, and several mentions in different communities and media. The third growth wave was thanks to our campaign on AppSumo, the biggest marketplace for early-stage SaaS. This coincided with the team celebrating Viewst’s first anniversary. It was a real turning point that forced us to start building a proper marketing strategy. The AppSumo numbers convinced us that pain points indeed exist, that our users are ready to pay for Viewst to solve this problem, and that they would make use of the service several times a month. I think it’s worth emphasizing that in our first year, all instruments we use to market Viewst were available free and that growth was purely organic. My view is that it is too early to share our experience on building a proper marketing strategy. We are still testing hypotheses, investing in content, and doing our best to create value for our growing community of users. ‍",1,1
218," We’ve seen significant upticks of signups when people shout us out on Twitter. Productivity tools tend to do best on Twitter since tech/VC Twitter is always searching for the next cool thing. One thing that doubled our retention overnight was sending new users a tutorial email every day for the first few days after signing up for Vimcal. Often, people sign up for a new tool on Friday, close their laptop for the weekend, and on Monday, they’ve already forgotten about it. ",1,0
219," We do marketing on a small personal scale and with the highest quality. For example, we frequently send highly targeted personalized emails or LinkedIn messages to agencies, along with an example of one of their clients’ websites’ visual sitemaps. 99% of the time they don’t need the service immediately, but they might over time, so we try to nurture those relationships through emails and meetings we have with decision-makers of the agencies. Our launch on Product Hunt was also really huge for us. We made the Top-10 most upvoted product of the year. Google Search has also been performing well.",1,0
220," I focused only on one strategy: Search Engine Optimization. The reason why I didn't carry out any other tactic was that I was far away from my clients and couldn't interact with them personally. I started learning SEO on my own, especially through tries and failures. In 2012 there weren't many online courses, so I started reading blogs and a few books that explained some tactics and concepts about SEO. Growing the e-Commerce that way was a big pain. As you probably know, SEO is slow if you are not an expert. And if you commit many mistakes (as I did) is even worse! It was in spring 2013, when some of my mistakes led my website to get hit by a Panda Penalty, that I decided to get a true formation on SEO and stop losing my time with pure errors. The Panda Penalty forced me to improve the quality of my content, learn more about SEO and clean the website. The positive side of losing a lot of visitors and possible sales? I learned a lot about Search Engine Optimization. ‍",0,0
221," Everything we did was online, we started using social media to spread the word. We got our first customer/team very quickly. I think some of it was luck and the rest just lots of cool information being shared around Twitter.  At the time of starting VO2, Facebook was also a good platform for spreading the word. At that time the organic visibility of pages was still pretty good before they turned into a full-on pay to play platform.  At first we used Google Ads to gain traffic and sales leads. This helped us build a good level of data on what people searched for and which keywords/phrases converted better.  The main growth happened as soon as we started using Search Engine Marketing. When our SEO kicked in we ended up receiving between 2-5 sales leads per day on our good days, which became the lifeblood of the company.  From my experience, SEO is the way to go when it comes to finding people who are in the market and have an intent to buy.  It can take a good amount of time for organic traffic to start flowing but when it does start to come in as long as you keep investing time and resources then it just gets better and better. Hence why this is the main area of business for me now.  ",0,0
222," That’s the part which I’ve underestimated not from a budget perspective... I knew that I could pull in my own contacts and get a word of mouth marketing, but the thing I’ve overestimated was how market/companies are looking at remote work (or at least how they were looking at it back in 2017). For whatever reason, I thought that it would be easy to get the list of remote and permanent positions and I was happy enough to publish them for free initially to get some tracking and traffic. Oh, boy was I wrong...It turned out that a lot of remote positions where only half remote and in the end, companies wanted to get employees into their fancy/shiny/modern and super friendly office. In case if positions were truly remote, a candidate still needed to be on the same time zone as the rest of the team (which makes sense, but in IT nearly every big company has a team working in different time zone). In other words, I had little to no (just around 10-20) remote positions to show on my board and I could not guarantee, that a company HR person would not change their mind and add a restriction making it very hard to pass. In terms of marketing efforts, the good part was my own list of contacts. I knew who would use and benefit from this service. I also knew they would do a word of mouth marketing if it was working out well for them. The rest of efforts to get into search engines and email marketing was pretty much left aside and I don’t regret it, to be true. A list of well-targeted users is 100% better than any AdWords/Facebook campaign for sure! The part I regret about is not creating a social/product buzz to make it more official, it would have improved my chances to build better cooperation models with companies interested in permanent remote positions. ‍",0,0
223," The SEO was the only traffic channel I was truly aiming for. But there’s that little problem with SEO - it takes months, if not years before it starts getting into effect. The most important aspect of SEO is that you have a high quality, in-depth content. There are hundreds of factors impacting your Google rankings, but none of them will help you as much as having a truly unique and outstanding content. After a few months, Google’s spiders started paying attention and the traffic started to grow. I’ve signed up for the Amazon affiliate program and placed CTA links at the end of the individual camera review articles. I remember that only days after placing the links someone bought the camera on Amazon and I got my first affiliate fee cut. I couldn’t believe it’s happening. It was especially motivating because the cameras I was reviewing were in the $300 - $500 range so I got around $20 from each individual sale. When I’ve started seeing the first sales coming in, I decided to double down on Waterproof Digital Camera Blog. I became impatient and this eventually lead to the failure of the project. The first thing I started doing were the real reviews of the waterproof cameras. I remember it was early summer 2011 and I’ve just obtained my scuba diving license. I wanted to get the real cameras to test them out in the water. I’ve written to several big-name brand representatives who had an office in Ljubljana, if they have models for testing. It turns out that they had cameras who they lent to magazine writers for the reviews. I’ve prepared a pitch how I’m running this successful blog in English and supported it by same numbers. Apparently, this was convincing enough that they were happy to provide me their cameras for a couple of days. In the middle of the summer, I was even allowed to take the camera from Olympus to the 1-week-long scuba diving cruising around Adriatic Sea. From actually having the cameras, I was able to write the hands-on reviews, take sample shots, videos, so the quality of the reviews improved a lot at this stage. From simple 1,000-words dry reviews of the features, they became longer in-depth articles I’ve usually broken down to 6 or 7 subpages (technical overview, design & quality of build, quality of the image, sample shots). The second thing I’ve got this blog into was eventually fatal to the business. Even though the initial SEO results were promising, I became impatient and wanted the results faster. I have discovered that hugely popular blog of networks called BuildMyRank where you were able to buy the backlinks to your site from domains with a good PageRank (yeah, PageRank was the thing back in the days!). ‍",0,0
224," When my business partner was around, that was the marketing strategy. Well… we weren’t really doing marketing, but high touch sales. He was the sort of person that could find customers everywhere. He would go out to buy a pen and come back with a customer. I always appreciated it, especially when I was forced to do it myself. We did have growing organic signups but nothing spectacular. We tried several marketing strategies but it didn’t make a difference in either direction. What always made a difference was Jules doing high-touch sales. Sadly, one day he realized he needed to do something else, he was burned out from working at a startup. It was very abrupt. He told me that either I stayed as CEO or we were closing down the company. I chose to stay. Without him, our growth stagnated. I kept the company going by making sure it was well staffed and maintained. I managed several developers and support staff. I tried for a while to make it grow, we re-launched a new website, did some marketing, but nothing I did really moved the needle. We grew 2x or 3x during that time because the product was good and because our churn was 0%. I’m not kidding. Our churn for the first 3 years or so was literally 0%. Watu was a very sticky product, and once a company started using it, it was very unlikely for them to leave. Most of our churn were companies going out of business. I had a period of trying to pivot the company. I felt a lot of responsibility towards my staff, their jobs, their families. But nothing I tried really worked and eventually, we dialed down the company to the bare minimum, reducing costs, generating profit, and doing profit sharing. We only started to consistently lose customers to a competitor in 2019, about 8 years after we started it and about 4 years after we stopped developing. That’s how good of a business it was. At that point, we approached several of our competitors and we made a deal to sell the company. ‍",0,0
225," When we launched the first version of Wavve we didn’t have an audience and thanks to our failed startup the year before, we didn’t have any funds. The only real resource we had was time (outside of freelancing to pay the bills) so we started with direct sales. Direct sales was a great way to validate the product and ensure that we people would pay for the product. It seems obvious now but podcasting was really starting to hit its stride in 2016 & 17 so we decided early on to double down on podcasters. We built some scraping tools to build a list of podcasters and began reaching out to them personally via email. The results came in slowly but this was a great strategy to test our messaging, pricing, and packaging.  Once we realized our price point was going to fall between the $10-$30 range, we knew we had to find something more scalable. We then started focusing on content marketing through our blog. We started with simple how-to pieces and then graduated to more podcast focused content. Our approach wasn’t very scientific. We simply put ourselves in the shoes of our target customers (podcasters that also have a related business) and wrote content around how to start, launch, and grow a podcast.  Traction has always been slow and linear for us. We never really hit any specific inflection point that made us feel like the business was going to “make it”. Rather, we just keep being consistent with content marketing and social media. With every month of growth, our monthly recurring revenue began to grow We have been lucky in that our product creates shareable social content. This naturally encourages word of mouth growth. Once we noticed this happening, we really doubled down on making sure our product made videos stand out on social media. The more we could get people asking “Wow. How did you make that video?”, the more referrals we would get.  We focused a lot on creating high-quality, custom audio animations. These animations are a staple of our product and while we had competitors, no one has animations quite like ours. Making sure these animations and other video elements stand out from the rest was key.  Revenues growth has always been linear and predictable with consistent month over month growth: We have kept the team lean with only 3 equity partners and a small team of contractors that help with support, marketing, and engineering. Running lean has allowed us to really focus on product development to deliver more features to our customers. Most notably, we were able to complete a massive project for supporting subtitles/captions within Wavve videos. ‍",1,0
226," In order to validate our idea, we focus on Product Hunt. We’ve done five launches in about two years, with which we managed to build and better our product and reach our first paying customers. Here’s an overview of the PH launches: ‍ 1st launch - November 2017 ‍ This was our first launch on Product Hunt. It was our first MVP, an app that took the stats directly from the GitHub API. We managed to have some users on the app but we didn't have a database to store the users :) I know... it was a big mess. I remember in the first half an hour after the launch our landing page was down and our engineer didn't respond to the phone... in the end, it was a good test that helped me with the decision of changing the technical team. ‍ 2nd launch - August 2018 ‍ This was the first launch done with my co-founder, Valentin Buzea and a decisive launch for our path. We managed to become the 5th product of the day and receive over 80 negative comments from the engineers because the product was meant to help non-technical managers to better understand the engineers. We didn't realize we were targeting the wrong audience. However, a few months later, without any paying customer, we did realize pivoted from non-technical managers to technical leaders (CTO's, VP's, CIO's and engineering managers). ‍ 3rd launch - January 2019 ‍ This was the decisive launch for our company I remember we managed to finish a big feature on Wednesday and we launched on Friday in order to test if the Product Hunt community would still hate us.  We tagged all the people who had left us negative comments to see what would happen. Fortunately, we managed to have 0 negative comments and also to have a lot of new users who started to use our platform. The old users began to give us valuable feedback, as well, and told us they would upgrade. It took us about on month since this launch until we scored our first paying customer. ‍ 4th launch - May 2019 ‍ Now our company started to grow, and we prepared for our big launch on Product Hunt, a launch with a product with more features and valuable customers. We managed to convince the #1 community member of 2018, Hiten Shah, to hunt us but we failed. We weren’t featured because we didn't have six months since the last launch. It was a black day for us, but we decided to wait another three months. ‍ 5th launch - August 2019 ‍ After 23 months since the first launch on Product Hunt and 29 months since the incorporation, the stars have aligned perfectly to bring us # 1 position of the Product Hunt homepage. It was a celebration of the past 29 months of hard work and sacrifices. This was just the start of Waydev. As a startup, you don’t have too many resources to use and you have only a few silver bullets. Product Hunt was, fortunately, one of those bullets. Nowadays, we’re writing valuable content on our blog (one blog / week) and cold-reaching engineering managers in order to motivate them to try our product. We’re growing +40% month over month in terms of revenue, and we also have a retention of over 40% on an 8 week period.",1,0
227," I was the marketing guy at WedMap and I have to admit - I did a lousy job. We tried many things, but none of them really well. Social Media, Email Marketing, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, SEO… We knew all the right tools, but lacked having the right priorities, which hindered our marketing efforts and we made a usual mistake unexperienced founders do - focused too much on the product, thinking that it will sell by itself. We had some success with Facebook ads as our customer LTV was pretty decent and could offset the CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost). But our sales processes were not optimized, took a lot of manpower and sometimes we got too many leads, sometimes not enough. Looking back, I would have had much more success if I better focused on SEO as our competitors were not doing a very good job with it and we could have generated so much needed traffic, with very reasonable costs. But we wanted results now and SEO was too long-term. Ads were expensive but it brought traffic now. Sounds silly, I know, but that was the reality. One highlight though, I was reading a book titled ‘Traction’ by Gabriel Weinberg. It gave us the structure in our marketing strategy we needed. For a while at least... ‍",0,0
228," When we started building our business, we were very clear that we did not want to go the social media advertisements route for promotions. We devised our own growth hack since we wanted to grow organically. For the first 1000 users, we directly reached out, spoke to them, and shared the value proposition. We aimed to make them our ambassadors or brand loyalists who could advocate our brand to their communities. They, in turn, reached out to college students who wanted to be influencers and content creators and brought them on board. As we began to grow, we also tied up with placements cells of Management Colleges and picked students who wanted to become content creators. Over time, we tied up with 1000 such colleges and 10,000 students. This had a powerful network effect and we were able to make our mark among youngsters organically without spending our resources on costly advertisement campaigns. They became micro and nano influencers with their own groups of followers and we had our community of advocates and loyalists. It was our greatest and most successful marketing strategy. To date, 72% of our users have been acquired organically i.e., through word of mouth. 61% of our revenue is from these micro and nano influencers. ‍",1,1

230," For marketing, we had a Facebook and YouTube page, did some SEO, built a mailing list through the site, and I reached out to several startup and entertainment blogs to get our name out there. We also offered promotions and free trial periods to get people in the door. We spent about $35,000 on Facebook alone, that helped get some signups both free and paid, also increased our mailing list. The blog outreach helped build some link juice for SEO for the most part. A mailing list was effective in converting free users to paid. Facebook was a terrible investment. For 2 reasons: Although we gained a lot of new users that signed up through Facebook (and we had a 1 click Facebook signup button on the site), we could not email those users our newsletters because Facebook apparently hides users original email addresses and gives them a Facebook email instead for example mike@facebook.com and because of this, when we send out a newsletter, those to the Facebook domain would bounce back. FYI: about 70% of WURA total users were Facebook users. We later found this out but we had already spent thousands of dollars to get all those users.Facebook algorithm sucks! Every time Facebook changes its algorithm, those with public Facebook pages suffer. After spending all that money and getting all the thousands of followers to our Facebook page, we realized that those followers were almost useless because anytime we made a post, we were only reaching about 3% of our entire followers.  ",0,0
231,  Our strategy was to position us as a market expert in e-commerce and focus on small businesses by actively engaging in local business chamber activities and conducting webinars and knowledge sessions.  We knew that small businesses heavily relied on word of mouth and hence we paid considerable attention to our clients and went above and beyond our scope of work. We started finding traction when our inbound marketing strategy yielded results and we started getting lots of queries. ,1,0
232," The sales process in particular for our product was lengthy and problematic. A major factor that made sales difficult was that production companies buy or lease technology based on having sold show creative formats that rely on a given technology and the sales cycle time on show formats is much longer generally than the cash runway of your typical tech startup.  Our marketing/sales approach in this regard was to partner with known, successful producers who had existing network deals, and to create pilots and new show formats that could not be done without our technology and help them shop them around the broadcast networks. Because we had not yet raised the capital to move the product into a SaaS delivery model our options to get the product into a broader market was really limited to what we could do based on the professional broadcaster model where hardware was sold in as well.  We were at the right place at the right time, with the launch of a brand-new technology-forward network with Revolt Network. Since they were in startup as well, they were building out a brand-new control room which was a perfect opportunity to integrate our product from the beginning.  We spent a significant part of the first six months post-MVP to get the entire platform working with our customers new control room environment and supporting their app development agency as they attempted to get their app to work properly with our backend.  In early 2014, we launched on-air, with Revolt running segments called “Voices of Revolt” on their daily news program.  Towards the end of 2014 we also landed a competitive spot at a startup hub called “Sprockit” as part of the biggest broadcasters convention in the world, at NABshow in Las Vegas. At the convention, we generated a lot of interest, a lot of leads, and won a “Best of” award as part of our efforts there and this was a core part of our go-to-market approach.  We came away with three to four very solid prospects, that we had a 60-70% chance of converting to paid customers within the next 6 months. That would have put us well over $1m/year in business and in a position with sustainable cash flow. At the same time, we also had regional companies in South America and EU wanting to commit to being value-added resellers and installers in their respective regions, which was pretty exciting.  At this point, we had managed to also create a decent ability to live demo the platform without setting up a full stage production, and made it possible to run the entire demo with only two people (one producer, one participant).  ",0,0
233," This was my first time building a full campaign for a technology company, a free mobile app nonetheless, and it was definitely intimidating. We tried a few different strategies, but as a lover of social media I knew that we needed to find a way to harness the power of virality on other social platforms. After lots of testing and iterating, we ended up finding influencers to be the most economical method to grow. Once we figured out the right features, we decided to “relaunch” with an ambitious plan. We teamed up with Jake Paul who was at the time just starting to figure out the business model for his new venture, Team10. Jake and I met at a coffee shop in Beverly Hills, talked for a little under an hour and closed on a deal. If Jake produced over X downloads, he would vest up to Y% of the company’s total equity (and I think a small cash component too). Unfortunately, Jake bailed on the deal after producing a mere 1200 downloads, though we learned good lessons about working with influencers.  Soon after, I created a model that would estimate the number of downloads an influencer would bring in based on their public social media metrics, and we picked ~30 smaller Vine and Instagram influencers using that model. We paid over $60k out to influencers alone, but drove over 75k downloads using this strategy. We were written about on multiple websites and I even got to appear on Fox Business. ‍",0,0
234," I've always considered myself a marketing-first founder. Since day one, we've been running different marketing campaigns and tried many things over the years. Any marketing channel or marketing campaign can work as long as you find the right audience and have the right offer and product. We started with paid advertising of a hundred dollars per month to put into Google Ads for our target keyword, “maid service software”. And we slowly built that up. Now we spend about $20,000 a month on paid advertising. We also used cold email to grow to our first 100 customers. We were listed on every directory that we could find for SaaS companies to get easy backlinks. We have focused a bit on SEO over time, but we mainly published lots of content. We've done a ton of content marketing with lead magnets and paid/free content on our blog, as well as our YouTube channel. We've just been so active in the industry and have been around for so long that now we rank organically for all the keywords we want to be focused on. But the last thing to mention would be the Maid Summit, a virtual summit for maid service owners around the world to attend for free and improve their businesses. ",1,0
235, Email outreach mainly from the start until now and networking in different Facebook groups for entrepreneurs. I want now to start also focusing on SEO by onboarding a content writing agency this month. This is a long-term investment (6-12 months) but hopefully will generate leads with high intent and a low acquisition cost. ,1,1
236," As an e-commerce company, it’s critical that prospective customers can find our website online. We invest in digital channels like content marketing, SEO, social media, and email. Our most successful marketing so far has been our blog. It has allowed us to write articles that help us inform prospective and current customers about the nuances of our products, which can be very technical. ",1,0
