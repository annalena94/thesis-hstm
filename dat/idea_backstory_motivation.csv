0," During college, I thought I wanted to be a doctor. But oh man, the pre-med weeder classes were horribly boring and structured in a way where it wasn’t easy to study or learn. I noticed that my fellow classmates felt the same pain, and started looking for a better way. Inspiration hit when my roommates were talking about how they could remember every pokemon from 10 years ago, but couldn’t remember what they studied yesterday. That was the big ‘Aha!’ moment. Growing up I was always a gamer. My family would play hours of Dr. Mario (trash-talking the entire time) every week, and I always had the newest Nintendo game to dump hours into after sports practice. I continued playing games during college and made friends with some kindred spirits. My freshman roommate and co-founder was the best Meta Knight player in NA, so I was constantly surrounded by hardcore gamers and the new hot games. This kind of environment made it easy to tie game mechanics to a better way to learn. The University of Michigan (Go Blue!) has an amazing library. Every book you could ever want. I started devouring everything about games and learning and found that every book I tried to check out was on the syllabus for this EDU 222 class called “Games and Learning” led by Barry Fishman. Ended up enrolling in this class alongside my graduate work (studying Hospital and Molecular Epidemiology). The knowledge gained here helped us build the foundation for a working product and learn exactly why I remember everything about the Pokemon game from my middle school years. During college, I thought I wanted to own and operate my own music venue (being a doctor was my back up plan). To vet the field, I formed, led, and wrote music for a ska band called “Gunday Monday”, named after a joke about arm day at the gym. Ska was perfect music for understanding the music industry. Enough people liked it around Ann Arbor that you could get shows at every venue, but not enough liked it enough to form bands to compete with you for those shows. I ended up opening for every one of my favorite acts and getting to see them for free. I also saw how different types and scales of music venues worked from the inside. This taught me enough to know that I did not want to own my own music venue, although it was a lot of fun. That ska band taught me all about music production which generated all the sound effects and music assets for our game with 101 studios. Still have a few on Bandcamp here if you want a taste. I also learned a ton about management. Trying to get a team of 8 musicians to show up on time, let alone play music somewhat passably, was another good challenge that grew some serious new leadership muscles. This gave me the foundation I needed to build out the art assets while my co-founder coded up the actual game engine. ",0,0
1," Doing stand-up comedy was what led me to create 10er. 7 years ago, I asked my friend and fellow comedian if he wanted to do a podcast with me. Few people listened to podcasts back then, let alone knew what they were. Since then we’ve recorded 262 episodes and have recently ended the project. Along the way, we took donations from our listeners. One-time donations were fine – we were of course stoked that anyone would give us money for something they already got for free. But one-time donations were hard to plan anything around. And we didn’t want to keep pleading for donations. Then Patreon popped up and the model seemed like the perfect solution. Instead of sitting around waiting for donations, the donators subscribed to donate, giving an amount they decided themselves per episode we released. I never created a Patreon account for us though. Everytime I began I never finished signing up. The whole thing just seemed like a hassle. Too many input fields and things to consider and graphics to provide. Patreon expects creators to create more content for patrons. We felt we were already giving away lots with our already free content. So, being a programmer (and perhaps naive), building my own service as a side project seemed like the easier solution. I’d recently made another side project using Stripe for the first time (Motherload.dk – a webshop selling Danish comedy shows as digital downloads) and the experience of using Stripe was such a joy that I kind of felt like I could build anything. I still feel like that. What a wonderful service and company. Highly recommended! I built 10er only for my own podcast but in such a way  that if somebody came along and wanted to use it for their own project then it wouldn’t take too much of an effort. The first month 10er charged money was December 2014 and about half a year later the first other project joined.",1,0
2," Hi, I’m Harry Dry, 23 years old. Well, I’d just left university. I “studied” Economics and to be honest though the whole thing was a complete waste of time. I had no interest in sitting in a suit and bullshitting about Macroeconomics for my next 50 years. So I started learning to code. Began with Code Academy, then I found the Net Ninja, Wes Bos, Level Up Tuts who taught me pretty much everything I know. I’ve always been a big believer in real-world experience. There’s “blog post knowledge” and then there’s “DIY” knowledge. One thing is watching a Wes Bos copying some code and another is getting out there in the real world and doing it yourself.  So that was the reason I started my first business. Real coding. Real experience. Real money. I just needed an idea...   Well, I’d got back from university, arrived back at my parent's house and there were these huge canvases hanging on my bedroom wall. My friend Giles bought them for me as a gift for finishing my degree.  On the canvases were tweets from Roger Federer and David Luiz. Originally it was pretty surreal, “What, has Roger Federer tweeted me!” I realized they were fake when I noticed that Jeremy Corbyn, Theresa May and Donald Trump had liked them. But I still, it was a really thoughtful gift.  I just got really excited by these canvases. So I thought this is it. I’m going to try and build a website which allows you to write up one of these custom tweets and purchase them as canvas prints online. ",0,0
3," My first job was at Jimdo, a website builder company. I did lots of A/B tests there. Even though the concept of an A/B test is simple, it’s not that easy to do it right. And the more tests I evaluated, the more I realized that people neglected documentation of results. In my experience, the results were so valuable because they allowed me to have a knowledge of what worked and what didn’t. For this reason, I built an internal tool to solve this problem and to evaluate tests automatically. My teammates liked this tool, as they stopped needing to evaluate their tests manually. Instead, they just needed to fire a SQL query, and the tool did the rest. Documentation of A/B test resulted in great benefits, too. It was so much easier to argue on what we did, how it worked and what the next steps were. Also, many co-workers found this documentation useful as a source of inspiration for what they could do next. Seeing how successful this tool was at Jimdo, I decided (with the permission of my CEO) to turn it into a stand-alone service, called ABBY.io. It took me almost nine months to launch it. Someday after an exhausting coding session, I decided to pull the trigger in a “f*ck it, ship it” moment. ‍",0,0
4," Addressbin actually still exists, so I guess it's still in the process of failing. It started as an easy way to collect email addresses, mostly (as is my habit) as a way to provide myself a facility to do so for free and then expanded to allow other people. Having collected all those email addresses, it was a short step to allow people to send emails to them, which I implemented by making a special address for each list that would forward your message to each address, and just like that, I invented the Mailing List. I added a few more features (Drip messages, opt-in forms) but ultimately at this point, I was competing with Mailchimp and everyone else and decided to stop working on it. It's still up and running fine and requires very little input on my part. ‍",0,0
5," Being honest, these were the three main reasons why I started. I was born in an Indian middle-class family in a tier-three city (between 20k and 50k habitants). During my childhood, we continuously faced challenges, mostly related to money and resources. I wanted to remove this tag anyhow and wanted access to ample money for my family. So I had two options: joining the civil services or starting a business. My family and relatives still regret that I haven’t tried for civil services.Our college incubator was the second reason. They showed us the way to begin a startup we did it without any pressure, working on Govt subsidy and only paying INR 500 a month ($6.62 USD) for a full office, machines, and broadband. This was an amazing experience for two young boys.The third and the long-term reason is that I love working on solutions. I always feel a sense of responsibility when I observe my thinking patterns. I don’t find a problem as a problem but I think it as an opportunity to build a new solution. Initially, it was money that motivated me. However, to be able to drive a startup in the long term, the motivation behind it must be something else. For me, it was that continuous kick from inside that would make me be high without using any weed. I can talk about startup ideas, plans, world-changing businesses and projects, and all similar stuff, for days. ‍",0,0
6," I was still in college at Indiana University when I started Adproval. Thankfully, one of my majors was Entrepreneurship and I had saved all those courses for my final year so I was able to use my own idea for all the business planning exercises in school.  I became personally interested in “how websites make money” which led to learning about digital advertising / Google Display Ads. Around the same time, a family friend’s lifestyle blog was starting to grow really quickly. I asked her how she was monetizing her site and discovered that given the relative niche of her site and the lack of control of display ad networks, she didn’t have a good system. She was working directly with advertisers from brands she was comfortable endorsing which required a lot of manual work with back and forth negotiating, ad image uploading, analytics tracking, lining up her next advertisers, etc…  From that initial point, my original idea was to be a “Blog Coach” of sorts to help set up monetization streams for bloggers as a consultant. I thankfully had a professor teach me about the limitations of a time-services company and suggested how the scalability of software could help!  Apart from this, I also ran my brother's lawn and landscape company in High School when he left for college. My family history is very entrepreneurial, though, from my great grandfather (who was one of the first inventors of the Travel Trailer / RV) to my dad (who always was tinkering with his own businesses).",0,0
7," Jared: I come from a background in branding and digital marketing, but I’ve always had a passion for making music. Strangely, that’s why this all happened – I was sick of all the confusing, expensive, and unnecessarily complicated warranty plans for all my music gear, plus my phone, my laptop, and so on. I knew there had to be a way to make this better for me as the customer, and when I found out that the product I wanted didn’t exist, I decided to build it. Eric: Out of college, I was originally a jet engine engineer with GE Aviation, but I ended up moving into management consulting and venture capital while attending Harvard Business School. When Jared told me about his concept of bundling device protection this way, I knew immediately that this was the kind of big idea that I was looking to execute and help reach its fullest potential. That’s what we’ve been doing ever since.  Jared: We initially launched direct to consumer, which wasn’t necessarily the best approach for us, but because the product is so compelling, we ended up getting a lot of inbound interest and business partners. That made us realize that organizations all across the country wanted the same thing we did – a single, seamless way to protect the devices of their customers, members, students, or teams.  Eric: That led us to build an entire platform to service B2B and B2B2C opportunities, and at this point, we’re truly a universal platform that sits at the center of our repair-shop partners, underwriting options, customers, and business partners. ‍",1,0
8," In my first job out of college (Bain), I was frustrated by how subjective hiring was. Along with a number of other recent Stanford grads, I was assigned to review Stanford student applications for the entry-level consulting position. I was struck by how differently my peers and I assessed candidates. We were aligned on the outcomes that defined a good hire (high-performance ratings, retention), but we disagreed on the inputs that generated those outcomes. For example, some of us thought a STEM background was critical others thought humanities majors did better. Some thought club leadership was a key input, others thought a high GPA was critical. It occurred to me that we could answer these questions analytically, by mapping our performance/retention records back to job applications and looking for correlations.  I started to dig into this problem in my free time in 2011-2012, and I quickly stumbled on 3 challenges. First, the data wasn’t readily available - it was spread out across homegrown systems that lacked APIs or basic file export capabilities. Second, HR leaders weren’t thinking about data science and their eyes tended to glaze over when I started talking about analytics. Third, I realized that the outcomes data (the “ground truth” represented by performance ratings and retention) could themselves be biased if the organization was biased in the way it treated some hires. So I paused. But I kept watching the HR space and by 2016, I thought the first 2 barriers were eroding. It seemed to me that most enterprises had moved to cloud-based HR systems with API/export capabilities and HR leaders were starting to get excited about data science. In late 2016, I started asking companies if they would share anonymized employee data with us and a few did so. While I was still at Harvard, we confirmed that there really was predictive power in these companies’ job application data that predicted who would perform well and remain in the job. This was a signal these companies weren’t yet using or aware of. With some proof-of-concept in hand, I went full-time on Ansaro as soon as I graduated from Harvard.",0,0
9," I was working in a pharmacy, where I realized how even a small store needed scheduling software for its employees. The way we managed employees and their working hours was very outdated. We used excel sheets and simple pen and paper to manage staff and their shifts. This caused lots of confusion and conflict among the employees.  Before studying pharmacy I already had a passion for software development and was involved in a few projects. So after looking at the current solutions, I saw great potential. They were outdated, had bad UI, were overloaded with complicated functionality. And the barely usable ones were far too expensive. I previously had written a scheduling software just to use it in the pharmacy where I was working. The idea wasn’t to make money off it. So I wrote the scheduling software and a task management tool which they are still using, and some other pharmacies as well. But then I decided to rewrite the application (the scheduling software) for all kinds of businesses. ",1,0
10," AskTina was a live video chat widget for experts to install on their blogs and allow their readers to place live, pay per minute calls to their mobile phones through the AskTina app. We built an MVP, had 35 Experts install it on their blog and with 10,000 page loads of the widget, we had 0 paid calls placed through the software. This was the objective data we needed to make the judgment to kill the project. Ideally, we could have discovered this before we spent 6 months working on AskTina by interviewing the readers of specific blogs. ‍",0,0
11," I met my co-founder on Instagram oddly enough. We were both Amazon sellers but he was a bit further along than I was. We would meet once a week to hold each other accountable to our goals and talk strategy. He had already started developing our first product, which is a CRM tool for wholesale Amazon sellers called Vendrive CRM.  We started working together on the project but quickly realized we had the skillsets to do something larger. That’s when we had the idea of building an intelligent repricing tool that put engineering and data over sales and started working on Aura. We were fortunate enough that our monthly expenses were so low that Vendrive actually provided enough cash flow for us to fund our time developing Aura and getting to our launch day. It was painful but focusing on delayed gratification is a founders secret weapon!  ",1,0
12," Autto.in was an on-demand doorstep car service provider, which operated in the city of Hyderabad, India. Our service consisted of sending mechanics to the doorstep of car owners who required general maintenance services, such as oil change, spark plug change, battery change, among others. As a car owner, I used to find going to the automotive dealer garages very expensive, as my car was out of warranty. And, apart from the big costs, I had some bad experiences with an authorized garage. This motivated me to solve this problem by myself, by asking mechanics to visit me and fix the car in front of me. ‍",0,0
13," Before we met, Roman had been working as a software engineer for global startups for over 8 years.  Stacy worked in marketing and communications. She's built her career from a PR manager of an Olympic champion to a CMO of an E-commerce company selling goods in 100+ countries worldwide.  It might sound funny, but we owe Tinder for our meeting - 5 years ago, its algorithms matched us together. That’s how the Awesomic story began.  After two years of relationships, we started thinking of a common business - we were simply cut out for this. We still laugh, saying that it was a perfect match not only for us but for many people eventually. Our first project was creating different apps for Shopify. We didn't have enough experience and any step-by-step plan, which we quickly realized and quit after releasing two plug-ins.  At that time, we also graduated from the Y-Combinator startup school, which was one of the key milestones in our development. It helped us understand where we'd like to move next and how to work on our mistakes. While carrying out our first project, we found out that a good developer was a rare bird on the Ukrainian market. Using Romans' experience, we decided to launch an online school for developers - Doge Codes. It was going pretty well. In 2 years, we had 200+ graduates and became the first Github representatives in СIS countries. Our concept was ""learning by doing"" - the students were mastering development while creating a real app. Yet, there was one big disadvantage - Doge Codes was a local project. And however happy we were to see our student's progress, we still wanted to work for the international market.  So here is our first insight - if you want to create something global, think on a large scale from day one because later, it might be impossible to make a big chair out of a small piece of wood. One day, we found out that we were almost out of budget, and Roman was even going to find a ""proper"" job if we didn't come up with a new business idea.  At the last moment, it hit us: design subscription - that's what everyone needs.  You know, small businesses and startups like Doge Codes often face the same problem when it comes to design. They don't have enough tasks to hire a full-time designer but still need marketing visuals and website-related graphics. Mostly, they choose to work with freelancers who are sometimes unreliable and don’t live up to the expectations.  We did quick research, didn't find any existing models, and decided to give it a try. And that turned out to be an Awesomic idea.",1,0
14," When I was first raising money for my education company, I had no clue what I was doing. I neither had the network of investors nor knew how to fundraise or build a pitch deck. So, I ended up making many mistakes. Back then, I bought a pitch deck template from a small website. I liked it because of its perfect structure. Later on, I met the website’s founder, and he told me that he wanted to sell the business. After checking some of the numbers, it became evident that I had to buy the company and use my experience to bring it to the next level. And that's what I did. In 2019, I acquired BaseTemplates and grew it from one product to five. Over the years, I  have helped thousands of founders raise money for their idea. ‍",1,0
15," Honestly, my options were a bit thin on the ground. I’d moved to a new town with limited opportunities for my skillset my employer was happy to let me work from home but shortly after that they made me redundant. Realistically, my options in the locality were to take a 30% pay cut or start my own business. And if I was taking a massive pay cut anyway, I wasn’t going to answer to some other bastard! ‍ What's your background? What part of your background defines you, and possibly led to starting Bediwin Information Services? I grew up the son of a self-employed accountant most of my mum’s clients were themselves self-employed. In those days, a small business owner could (with enough sacrifice) put a child through a private school. So many of my friends growing up came from families that had a business of some sort. So, I didn’t perceive it as being particularly risky I just saw it as another way to earn a living. ‍ How did the idea come to you?  I knew my employer needed me occasionally - but the keyword here is “occasionally”. They certainly didn’t need me full-time. In that respect, their decision to make me redundant was absolutely correct. So, I offered to take redundancy and contract back to them on the understanding that I was free to seek other clients when I wasn’t dealing with them. They accepted this offer, became my first (and, for that matter, biggest) client and that gave me a basic income to get started. ‍",0,0
16," We applied to the Techstars accelerator with the concept of “Twilio for Biometrics”. We were going to build an API so any developer could quickly and easily add biometric identification to their software. This was back in 2013 and when we did our customer discovery, we got a lot of blank stares. It was probably way too early. But we did learn that there were huge problems with online fraud that were really identity problems. When you do business with anonymous people, you have no recourse if they turn out to be assholes and we felt like we could address that problem. If you want to defraud someone online, you create an account with a fake identity and use stolen credit cards. Then the real credit card owner discovers they have been a victim of identity theft and the credit card company reverses the charges. The money is taken back out of the online merchant’s account but they have already mailed the merchandise. Online merchants lose a lot of money this way. BeehiveID identified online accounts created for fraudulent use. My technical co-founder has a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering and had an interest in social network analysis. He came up with the concept of using social network analysis on the data available through Facebook in combination with a few other tricks to identify a fraudulent online user. This is how BeehiveID saw the social network graph of a fraudulent online account. This is how BeehiveID saw the social network graph of a real person. So, the idea was that a person would log in to a site using the Facebook OAuth and BeehiveID would comb through the data available through Facebook and let the site know if the account was fake. It’s still a really great idea. (If only a great idea was enough.)",0,1
17," Myself and two partners launched my first company while I was in college. I dropped out shortly after to focus full-time on the business.  What started in 2006 as the dream to create what would become Bildr quickly pivoted into a services business when funding for “no-code” developer tools fell on deaf ears about 15 years ahead of the market. We didn’t let that kill the visual development dream, though. Instead, we served customers using early versions of Bildr to create custom web apps faster and with fewer resources than our competition. As time went on, our customers continued to request more advanced features, so we continued to expand the capabilities of the tools to match that need. A few years ago, as the market caught up to the concept of visual development, we decided to spin Bildr out as a separate product company. So in July of 2020, we took the plunge, formed the newco, and began iterating with early alpha users as we completely reshaped our internal tools as a product suitable for market adoption. We are incredibly excited to be launching out of beta in Q1 alongside a suite of web3 and NFT products driven off of Bildr’s uniquely extensible architecture. ‍",1,0

19," My entrepreneurial days didn’t start with BizzBee Solutions. I always had a hunch for business. So, it all started back in college when me and my friends founded AdvertSMS. These were my beginnings, the place where I learned how to do market research. This was my first project, my stepping stone to more serious projects of my own.  The next thing I did was to enroll at Sheffield University, where I acquired an MBA, which was of tremendous help in my business journey. Having the theory and the practice, I knew I could aim for big things.  Afterward, I started working for Retell Ltd, a Dutch software development company, as head of their R&D department. Though this job was bringing much-needed income, it was way too corporate for me.  Meanwhile, I was doing some freelancing, which I came to realize, was bringing me much more. And I don’t mean just money. I mean much more satisfaction, joy, and fulfillment. I was doing something that I liked. So once again, I was at a crossroads.  Should I keep my steady, high-income job, or should I pursue my high-risk dream? The answer came to me in the most unusual way. It was delivered in the sweetest of ways, by a bee. I come from a long line of beekeepers, so I consider bees to be sacred, holy even.  So one day, as I was dragging my feet to my fancy corporate office, I saw a bee, joyfully enjoying the nectar of a fragrant flower in front of the building where I worked. It had no worries in the world because it did what it wanted and did best.     That was the sign from the Universe that I needed. I quit my job and started doing my freelancing full-time. Though fruitful, freelancing wasn’t an option for the long run. I needed stability. So, 2015 was the year when I gathered a small team of 5 interns, rented an office and a couple of desks and computers. It was how ‘BizzBee Solutions’ was born.  At BizzBee, I had the responsibility to teach interns how to do market research the right way. It was the first thing that we offered as a service, along with many others that came later before we specialized in outreach.",1,0
20," Honestly, I never wanted to build a product for developers before. Nor did I ever plan to become a “creator”, but here’s how it happened. Back in 2019, I started my first SaaS product: Affilimate, an affiliate dashboard for content publishers. It was born out of my experience building my travel blog, growing it to about $5K monthly revenue, and getting frustrated trying to keep track of my affiliate income and which strategies were driving conversions on my website. Especially as a developer, I knew there had to be an automated solution. So I launched the product alongside my partner Gernot, and together we recruited about 70 test users. They were in the travel niche, just like me. Start with what you know, right? Well, you can imagine what happened in 2020. In a matter of weeks, we went from landing our biggest customer and having our first $2K revenue month to everyone asking to pause their subscriptions. Suddenly my projects were earning under $500 per month in profit, and I had to lean on my savings. After taking some time off to grieve my failing business (and playing a lot of Animal Crossing) I decided to try something new. I launched Blogging for Devs as a free email course in May 2020.  It grew to over 1,200 subscribers in under two weeks. Eventually was voted #1 Product of the Day on Product Hunt. And when I launched the paid community 6 months later, net $10K in its first 6 weeks of being open for registration. What made this experience different is I started with a distribution plan from the beginning: a Twitter audience I’d built over years of blogging and conference speaking. My biggest lesson was how important it is to build distribution for your product. And that, in fact, without a reliable distribution channel, it’s almost irrelevant how good the product is in the first place.",1,1
21," Right after I graduated college I was hoping to help my brother with this business. The concept was to “clean up” the apartment rental market in Boston by featuring reliable listings that apartment hunters would know was verified.

The service was free to use for the end user, and our revenue model was based on agencies paying to have their listings on our site. ‍",0,0
22," SHAKED: Botnim was all about finding dishes around you by their nutritional values and location. I started getting into calisthenics, MMA and generally into fit in mid-2016. While and before doing that I used to eat outside - which is probably not the best thing do especially if you do that 3 times a day. So, after few months into the fitness world, my nutritionist friend built a menu for me and I started to cook at home. For most people, it's a hassle to cook at home, but even when they do that, sometimes they just can't get back home nor carry food & have to eat outside. This all thing happened exactly when I came back to Tel Aviv after a year in Berlin. Tel Aviv is very much into fitness & good food, so it looked like this would be a great service to have for people who care about their diets, including myself of course! Once I got to this point, I called Gilad and told him about the idea. He loved it and we started working on it. ‍",0,0
23," I’ve lived and worked in lots of different places. I’ve lived in over a dozen countries around the world, and all that travel forced me to be something of a minimalist. I used to travel with everything I owned packed into just three suitcases.  All that travel taught me that, far too often, people are planning their days around their things instead of enjoying the experience of traveling to new places. People have to lug heavy bags around with them and sometimes even have to cancel plans because they don’t have a place to store their things. It occurred to me that it would be great to have a central app or website that could help people find luggage storage quickly and conveniently wherever they were. That’s how Bounce started. The initial idea was to build this network of luggage storage facilities in the densest cities in the world. As the idea grew, I also saw an opportunity for package acceptance and receiving services. Before creating Bounce, I worked at Intuit where I built software for small businesses, which is similar to what we do at Bounce.  I’ve been an entrepreneur since I was a kid. I was always trying out new ideas and ways to build cool things. Along the way, I’ve had plenty of failures and partial successes that taught me more and more about what it takes to run a business and bring a new idea to the world. ‍",1,0
24," I’ve always been interested in starting a business. Beyond the financial upside, the variety of work, the (relative) agency of being your own boss and the satisfaction in bringing something new into the world appeal to me. I’m also fascinated by systems and organizational design. If the first act of a strong executive team is building a product or service that customers love, the second act is building the culture, processes, and team that enable sustained excellence in executing on that mission. Building a great culture is the only durable competitive advantage, and it seemed like a fascinating challenge.  But it took me a while to develop the conviction to do something on my own. I spent the first few years of my career at a real estate tech startup called Redfin, working on special projects and incubating new businesses within the company.  I had an incredibly cool job as a generalist at a fast-growing startup and learned a ton about products and startups from my mentors at Redfin. I wouldn’t change my first chapter for anything, but three years into the job, I was convinced it was time to strike out on my own. I had saved up some money, with few liabilities, and wanted to take a swing with my risk tolerance at its peak. So I quit my job without knowing quite what I wanted to build...and began a two-year journey to figure it out. I spent part of that time traveling the world and consulting on growth with a variety of startups to make money and learn about different organizational styles and markets (also to have fun).  Then I moved to NYC (where I’m from) and co-founded a pre-idea incubator for interesting people in tech working on their next thing. In hindsight, I’d recommend spending more time validating a thesis before quitting your job, but there’s value in open-ended exploration as well if you can swing it. I ended up as an EIR at a small venture fund in NYC and decided to spend one last summer working on ideas. That’s when I got introduced to my now co-founder Greg. He also came from the real estate tech world, and a mutual friend introduced us I knew nothing about office furniture when we had our first meeting. Greg had spent the past two years running real estate operations for a flexible office space company, where he encountered the issues with buying office furniture firsthand. When he spelled out the problems with incumbents, and the opportunity to create a 21st-century experience in a huge market, I was ready to hear more. Two months later, in September 2018, we incorporated the company. ",1,0

There is a lot of signals around sales, in the CRM, in your inbox, calendar, and online, but salespeople use little of it and end up being rather random in their actions. ‍",0,0
26," Back about a year or so ago, I was trying lots of ideas out to see if I could come up with a side-project to generate some residual income. I had a lot of skill as an engineer, but not a lot of business or marketing sense, so I was trying lots of stuff and was having a hard time gaining traction. Truth be told, the idea originally came from me working on a wish-list app that you could build from multiple providers (think of something like an Amazon List, but across all retailers). Doing this required me to build a scraping-engine so I could get photos, prices and other things that would make the lists more interesting and friendlier. This was all going swimmingly until I ran into Target :) For those that don’t know, Target runs what’s called a single-page app. This means that, when your browser goes to a page on Target, their web-servers don’t return anything interesting in their initial HTML payload. It’s only after the JavaScript runs that anything useful is finally rendered. But therein lies the problem: you had run JavaScript and a whole browser to effectively see what the final page looks like. Having run into that I started to look for something that gave me programmatic access to a headless browser that I could use for my nice new web-app. Spoiler-alert: there weren’t any. This was a refocus event for me, and I switched gears to writing browserless. And since I knew exactly what I wanted, it pretty much built itself (well, aside from the many hours I poured into the project). ‍",1,0
27," I personally started mobile development in 2011. Back then, I was developing my very first mobile application for Android: an app to check the balance of my prepaid SIM card. It was an experiment for me, and I just wanted to learn about Android. My mobile phone operator didn’t have an app and I was annoyed that I had to keep checking their website to make sure my credit didn’t run out. So, I made an app that used “web scraping” to get my balance from the website. (Web scraping makes use of an application to log into a web browser like a real user, click the appropriate buttons to get to the screen with the information you want, and then extract or “scrape” the information for your use.) It worked great for me. Since the operator didn’t have an app, I decided to make it public, in case it was useful to someone else. It turns out it was. Within a few months, it garnered more than 20,000 users, which was a high percentage of the customers that operator had back then. But the problem with web scraping is that unlike humans, applications can get thrown off by routine changes in the phrasing or structure of the information shown. For example, back then my application was being used by both prepaid and contract users, so the website looked slightly different for each kind of user depending on the product—different enough to break my application. To solve this, I decided to make a little web service that my application could send the data to if it turned the content was not what it expected. This way I could see what my application was seeing and fix the potential errors. This was the very first version of Bugfender. But back then it didn’t make any impact on me, it was just a solution I found to a specific problem I was dealing with at the moment. Shortly after that, I met Stefan in a mobile app consulting gig. Together we founded Mobile Jazz, a software consulting agency. At Mobile Jazz, we help our clients work on their ideas and then do all the legwork of specification and design to turn ideas into living web and mobile applications.  Within the context of Mobile Jazz, the idea of Bugfender was reborn in 2015. While working on a client’s project, a colleague, Aleix, had the same problem again. He had a situation where our mobile application was interacting with a server outside of our control and one of our beta testers was complaining the application didn’t work for him. But it worked for us! Since we could not see his phone nor the server, we were left totally in the dark. And again, Aleix came up with the same solution: building a tool to send all the logs to a server. Aleix was so excited with the idea, he hacked it together in a rush over that weekend and proudly showed it to us the next Monday. ‍ Wait. I was shocked. Faced with the same problem, we both had come up with the same solution. This confirmed to me that we were on to something. This had to be something! ‍",1,0
28," When I was 23, I was promoted to CTO at an outsourcing development company, a Magento & Symfony partner, and I had to manage the relationship with customers and a team of over 30 people. Basically, I was a child with a lot of responsibilities.  I didn’t know what my attributes were, so I started reading about it. What it really meant to be a first-time CTO. And from this research, I found something very interesting and valuable. Something truly WOW that guided me in the next few years: “The CTO should have a plan for everything. For everything that happens wrong, it’s his fault.”  So I started to learn and do whatever it took to make things happen: recruitment, HR, retention, sales, account management, development, sysadmin, DevOps, etc. In the next few years, I learned and tested a lot of things in real-life, and I kept following the same motto: that I needed a plan (which sometimes involved plans A, B & C) for everything. It’s this attitude that helped me become a Managing Partner at that great company.  After I worked out how to create teams and build software, I found myself wanting more. I wanted to build products, to find solutions for real use cases and problems, to make a contribution to the rest of the world.  So I left the company and joined a startup in the marketing space, a product designed for eCommerce, which improved conversion rates through A/B testing, personalizations, and popups. This was also the first time I’d ever heard of anything related to A/B testing, user personas, conversion rates, micro conversions, funnels, and a lot more terms and acronyms widely used in the marketing industry. It was a challenge that I wanted and was ready for.  Once the business started growing, it also became challenging from a technical perspective: more than 200k requests/minute, more than $15K/month at AWS. So I reached out to Microsoft and we became a part of their startup program, which landed us some credits (some, as in more than $100K - so thank you, Microsoft!)  We only needed to migrate our infrastructure from AWS to Azure to start saving $15K/month. So I started looking for a way of doing this that would allow us to operate our infrastructure after the migration in the same way as we did in AWS.  And I was very intrigued to find that this type of platform didn’t exist.  Since I wasn’t having any luck and because I really didn’t like having to depend on other people (remember - I was the guy with the plans) and I love automation, I created the tools internally. From provisioning to deployment, monitoring, and alerting. We successfully migrated from AWS to Azure and created our tools to manage the infrastructure - but this migration took 4 months!  You could call this my A-ha moment: when I realized that this type of tool needed to be created. A platform that took care of the exact same things every app needs, everything sysops related: provisioning, monitoring, alerting, backups, autoscaling, etc.  Who doesn't need backup or security or uptime? We all want the benefits of automation - not to automate again and again and again. Why reinvent the wheel over and over again?",1,0
29," As a parent of two young children, my days are full to the brim with excitement. I had been learning about mindfulness meditation at the time, but couldn't find a spare moment to really practice it. Every app and site I found, required sound that would always bring my toddler over to see what I was up to. Not very conducive to meditation.  I had the idea to build an app that would be geared towards mindfulness meditation outside of the traditional ""find a quiet spot"" methods.  BusyMind is a simple app that I built out over a month or so that serves this purpose. It guides you through basic breathing and observation exercises to help bring your mind back under control. It's entirely silent and can be done in a crowded room without drawing strange looks. ‍",0,0
30," When I started in fashion, I was very lucky to meet a lady that designed for a company called Mattel, the Barbie toy manufacturer. I think she saw some talent in me and she suggested going to work with her. I began working part time and it was an amazing opportunity. I was able to design clothes for Barbie and learn a lot through the 5 years I stayed in the company. After that, I was recruited by 7 for All Mankind, where I worked for 2 years, and then moved to Hause of Howe by Union Bay, where I worked for another 2 years. Affliction Clothing came later. I was hired as Head Designer and worked there for more than 10 years. While working for Affliction, I began thinking about something: I hated wearing dress shirts. “They’re stiff, they’re scratchy, and you can’t move in them!”. I would wear a t-shirt to the office and change out into a dress shirt just for meetings. One day I thought, “why can’t I make a dress shirt that feels like I’m wearing a t-shirt?” That was my “aha moment.” At the time I left Affliction Clothing, I had around 20 years of experience in the industry. I really wanted to start my own comfortable shirt brand but it was a difficult process which took me 2 years to decide to fully get into. I had a really comfortable and well-paid job so quitting it to focus on my own business was scary. One day, one of my mentors gave me a book from Steve Harvey called Jump, which talked to me about my life and my future. That’s when I decided to leave my job and focus on my own venture. I decided to go 100% on it and even sold my house to fulfill my dream. I travelled to China and worked with mills to develop what eventually became Buttercloth. I already had a relationship with different factories from my previous jobs, so I told them about my product and asked them if they would be interested in creating it. Three of the people I contacted denied as they thought it wasn’t possible to create such a product, but then one accepted. However, they warned me that to set up everything it would cost $3k and then $20k to get the first production. I decided to go with it. Using a special blend of 100% long fiber cotton and a unique manufacturing process, we developed a profoundly soft fabric I named “Buttercloth.” It had incredible breathability, 6-way stretch and an exclusive double finished construction. ",1,0
31, I have a degree in Mathematics from Brown University. I’m a web software developer. Cam.ly was one of the first jobs I had after college. Cam.ly was my business partner Rhett’s idea. He had built a few internet startups at that point. He is a true entrepreneur at heart and has since been building cryptocurrency startups. Rhett and I tried a business finding and matching great software developers with software companies. Two products got some traction jobpoacher.com and githire.com. Job Poacher was a simple form that said what you currently did and what you were looking for and had an anonymous email feature like craigslist. Git Hire read your GitHub profile and ranked you and reached out to top performers to see if they wanted jobs. ,0,0
32," As background, in July 2016, while camping with friends in Pemberton, BC, I asked, “Where are we? I mean, who owns this property that we are camping on?” A friend replied, “See that house over there? This is their private property.” That same summer, Nora, co-founder of Campertunity, and I went camping in a provincial park. This time, our space was much smaller, our camping neighbours a few feet away, and our morning disturbed by RVs driving by. An experience many campers can resonate with.  We see the headlines every year: too many campers and far too few campsites. The mad-rush to book your summer camping trip in the winter and the expensive re-sale of campsites is a barrier to enjoying the peacefulness of nature.  Our camping experiences, combined with the current stressfulness of booking a campsite, and the need for a solution led to Campertunity becoming a reality. The shared economy is growing in every way, from sharing our homes to our cars, so it’s a good time for camping to enter the shared economy. The public appreciates having options and power, which is what Campertunity provides.  Get people outside, build community, and sustain land are Campertunity’s goals.  ‍ As mentioned, I’m an Engineer, which may seem odd for someone who creates a camping website. But, for me, it makes perfect sense because after working for so many years and watching climate change destroy our earth, I understand the importance of maintaining mental and physical health. I believe one of the best ways to do that is to get outside. This is my major motivator in building Campertunity let’s help each other and our environment.  Before Campertunity, and even during, I maintain the title of Health and Safety Director. I’ve studied and worked in various countries around the world, so I get the importance of having motivation. Thankfully, my Campertunity co-founding partner has a background in tourism and customer service. So, the two of us together make a pretty great match.  When some people reach a certain age, maybe in their 30’s, 40’s or later, they gain a freedom where they are less likely to care about what other people think and more likely to put their fears aside. There’s a serenity that comes with being secure with ourselves. With the ability to put any fears aside, I was able to jump into creating Campertunity with the thought that if this business fails, at least I can say, with pride, that I tried. That alone is hugely worth being proud of.  Campertunity is my first jump into a business but not my first risk in life. I’ve traveled the world for work and invested in real estate I even took a risk and had a baby. I’m thankful to have had many successes, and a huge part of it has to do with attitude. What we think is what we manifest. Regardless of past failures or successes, know what you want and believe you will achieve it. ",1,1
33," I’ve always loved to create and fix things. It started early on when I was 16. I would fix cracked iPhone screens in my area and ended up fixing over one hundred phones. I profited a few thousand dollars from that and fell in love with entrepreneurship. I had a few other ventures when I went to college at Bryant University, including the Charging Chair, a beach chair that charges your smartphone (pictured below) and DirtByMail (acquired a website where you can anonymously send a bag of dirt to a dirtbag). Those ventures were really great because I learned different aspects of the business manufacturing for the Charging Chair and legal issues with DirtByMail. Throughout college, I fell in love with technology. So much so that I taught myself how to code. It served me well because I ended up getting a job as a software engineer at Wayfair in Boston. While I was there, a good friend and bar manager, Ryan Dolan, mentioned the struggles of booking live music. We talked through the idea and decided it would be a fun project to work on. I was especially keen on joining since I wanted to expand my engineering skills to some real world projects. Our goal was to make an app that would allow the bar manager to send out gig invites. I built an MVP early in 2018 (which was very ugly) and we iterated on that. Ryan and I actually won a local startup competition for Canary in Worcester, MA where we won free office space for a year. You can see us (me on the left, Ryan on the right) proudly repping our Canary swag and standing in front of our first office. As Canary continued to grow and as things were becoming more serious, Ryan decided he didn’t want to leave his day job to pursue Canary full time. He actually decided to pull out of the project completely, which is when I went looking for another co-founder and found Josh.",1,0
34," Before Career Sidekick, I was working as a recruiter in Boston. That’s how I learned the job search tips that I share on the website, and that was the original premise of the site: Practical advice from an executive recruiter. However, the website didn’t grow or succeed initially and eventually took a back seat to other projects for a couple of years. During this time, I continued working as a recruiter and eventually quit, moved to Thailand temporarily, and began working as a freelance digital marketer. My dream was always to succeed with a web business and leave freelancing behind, though. However, I made many mistakes that stopped Career Sidekick from growing initially. One mistake was beginning too broad and not choosing a narrow enough niche. The saying, “niches make riches” is true in my experience. The website was originally a career advice blog where I wrote about all sorts of topics, from why it’s unfair for employers to require a two-week notice, to how to succeed while working for multiple bosses. I had two big problems here in terms of the content marketing strategy: First, it was too scattered. I was writing about all sorts of different things, so nobody had a reason to pay attention or follow me for any of those topics. Second, I was writing content that I felt like writing, instead of writing about topics that my audience was searching for help with online! This seems so basic and simple now, yet I see many blogs (both personal and corporate) making this same mistake. If you want to succeed with SEO and blogging, you need to research what people are searching online and write posts that directly address the information that people want help with. I only started seeing success when I recognized these errors and niched down into just job search advice, and began writing content that directly answered my audience’s questions. ‍",1,0
35," I’ve always known that I want to be my own boss at some point. By 2014, I started to seriously think about starting something, anything. I was getting antsy because I knew that it’d take me multiple years and attempts to build something successful, so I needed to get started ASAP. It seems silly in hindsight, but I wanted to “make it” by the age of 30. So, I quit my job as soon as I got my bonus that year. I didn’t have any business ideas when I quit, but I figured quitting the job would give me the motivation and time figure it out. The idea for Chowdy came about in a random conversation I had with my housemate and soon-to-be business partner complaining about how food was so expensive in Toronto. Since neither of us knew how to cook we should just hire a chef to make our food for us. I applied my consulting modeling skills and quickly realized that it’d be too expensive to cook for just the two of us. Then we wondered what if we could have a chef make food for 10-20 of our friends, and for multiple days at a time. With that, we decided to just try it out. My partner knew a cook personally. We pitched the idea to him and he loved it. We messaged 30 friends we thought might be interested and got 20 of them to agree to try it for a month. 2 weeks later we made our first batch of meals. After the trial period of 1 month, we were pleasantly surprised to find that most of our friends wanted us to keep going. We did and opened it up to the public, and that’s how Chowdy came into being. By the way, we weren’t called Chowdy in the beginning. We thought our target demographic was the fitness/gym crowd, so we called ourselves “FuelBite”. As I’ll explain below, we were forced to change our name a few months in and we came up with “Chowdy”. Full credit goes to my partner for this name, which he came up at 3am in the morning after we thought off and tossed out what felt like 1000 ideas. We both loved it instantly because it sounded food-related, friendly, and gender-neutral (it was important for us to not sound either too masculine or feminine). ‍",0,0
36," My co-founders and I worked at a company called Teachable for 4 or 5 years. While we were there, we noticed something interesting happening in the creator market.  Creators are people making money from their passion, generally building an audience, connecting people, and teaching online. A lot of these people create content and, by the time we started Circle, there were already a lot of tools to host this content. However, there weren’t many tools to host the creator’s audiences. Therefore, we decided to create a tool that allowed these creators to build a community really easily and integrate it within their tech stack and websites. ‍",1,0
37," My co-founder and CEO - Tanya, came up with the idea. At the time, she was working for a law firm in Germany and thought that we could automate a lot of what goes into processing a flight disruption claim.  Prior to ClaimCompass, I worked for a chartered airline in Montreal doing customer acquisition. Later on, I moved to Berlin to work for a PR and Marketing agency and for a while, I also worked as an analyst for the Canadian Federal Government.  A lot has changed since we first launched ClaimCompass. We were an entirely distributed team working on the idea nights and weekends out of 4 different time zones, doing, among others, a lot of useless stuff, but somehow getting traction. It got to a point where we decided to quit our jobs and give this gig all of our energy.  That drew the attention of our first investors: in October of 2016, 500 Startups and one of their micro funds in Istanbul, invested $200K and asked us to join their program in Silicon Valley. For the next couple of months, we grew the company by about 10x and in March of 2017, with a couple of hundred in booked revenue and very little cash, we decided to move to Sofia, where we hired our first employees.  My past experiences are mostly solopreneurship type of stuff, like real estate rentals, trading stocks, and crypto before it was cool (yeah, like 2014). Can’t say I’ve been overly successful in any of the above.  ‍",1,0
38," After the first company I tried to start failed, I joined a venture studio as a developer, working my way up to Head of Development. We had 3 companies in our portfolio, and after one became apparent it was going to be the winner, I joined full time and eventually became CTO. It was a real-time security and surveillance application (VSaaS) and was the hardest product I’ve ever built.  After a grueling 4 years of raising $8M, winning a Gartner award, scaling up, and then scaling down (shrinking is much harder than growing IMO) I found myself faced with an interesting and exciting question. What do I want to do now? Kidding. That was flippant. I needed cash! Fast! Not bail bond fast, but like... I have a mortgage you know? And Santa Monica ain’t cheap! The reality of not having a paycheck any longer settled on me while quarantining above a garage in Connecticut. My partner and I flew out there for a (small!) wedding. I was in a new environment, perhaps that’s why when I pulled out my list of a thousand some odd business ideas, I wanted to try something outside of my wheelhouse. Keep in mind, I had launched (and failed) at roughly 30 other SaaS products during my time at the venture studio. Some were half-baked, some were “Build it and they will come” kind of things, so don’t think I’m a total loser! I never intended to stay at the venture studio but got stuck in a cycle launching stuff that “didn’t work”. In retrospect, so many of those ideas would have worked, I just didn’t have the grit to stick with them and had not yet learned how to sell. I knew I wanted to do a kind of studio, but this one was going to be different. During the last few months of the security company, I came across Andrew Wilkinson and Tiny Capital. He had started an agency that ended up being wildly successful and that cash flow eventually allowed him to start buying companies. I thought, ‘This is genius! Starting a company from scratch is hard! But if you just buy it, you skip the whole “will people pay for this?” phase and skip right to the making money phase!’ I put a small posting on Indie Hackers to see if anyone else was thinking along the same lines. Dozens of people got in a slack channel I put together but they all eventually faded away, except for two people, both named Michael, one of which would become the CEO of Cold Email Studio, only I didn’t know it yet. So back to the little quarantine studio above the garage in Connecticut. As a side note, I had just finished my second book, an open-source sci-fi novel, and was working on marketing that through Facebook Ads. I popped open Notion, navigated to my business ideas list, and started reading. I was tired, jetlagged, and burnt out. I put my life into a product for 5 years and it didn’t work out. This is not exactly a great environment to get excited about writing code or enthusiastic about hopping back on the treadmill.  I remember spending very little time picking. I did not scroll endlessly through old ideas. The list itself is structured to have the newest ideas on top. I’m also an incessant builder so I have a rule that I’m not allowed to execute on an idea for at least two weeks. If after two weeks I haven’t lost interest, I’ll build it. The real answer is that I picked this idea because I was burnt out. A hardcore, 2-years-of-3AM-support-calls kind of burnout. But this idea? This idea I don’t have to write any code for! LFG!",1,0
39," For 18 years of my law enforcement career, I was a DRE (Drug Recognition Expert) and DUI Instructor. As a DRE, part of the protocol was confirming that an individual was impaired and that I was correct in my assessment of the individual. Most of the time they were suspected of driving under the influence of drugs, at the conclusion of the evaluation a drug test is conducted to confirm if the driver has drugs in his/her system that is responsible for the impairment observed during the evaluation. I became interested in employer drug testing and workplace safety after finding out that companies were losing time and money having an employee and supervisor go to a clinic to do drug testing where they would sit for hours due to other emergencies or situations taking priority over the drug testing. I found no one in our area who was doing onsite mobile drug testing for employers and that was when my wife and I began looking into the opportunity of starting a business that would focus on the employers and the needs they have for a drug-free workplace ‍",1,0
40," To be honest with you, my motivation to build Community Coders could have been the first red flag - I initially had no idea of my own personal “why” of pursuing entrepreneurship. It was my first year at university and I just wanted to try something new. As a 19-year-old, I had no idea what starting a business was actually like, and was inspired by a lot of people on Instagram and LinkedIn who showed the glamorous side. I’d have to say I was a bit misinformed in terms of what starting and trying to build a business actually was like. As soon as I had this idea for Community Coders, I already envisioned having offices Canada-wide and being able to create an impact at the national level. I dreamed and loved the idea of being an owner of something that could be big one day. In terms of my background, I didn’t really have any hard skills or a degree (other than my first-year business courses) that led to starting Community Coders. University helped me start my first business in the sense that it provided additional opportunities, funding and grants, co-op/internship credits and networking opportunities throughout my journey. However, throughout my time building Community Coders, I found that one of the things that motivated me was providing an opportunity for young adults to recognize their own potential. When I was in high school, I worked in fast food for my summer gig, and if I look back at it, doing coding projects or managing social media accounts and getting paid would have been awesome as well - the flexibility, the pay, and the relevant experience for me to leverage on my resume were all solid selling points (not to discredit the skills I learned in fast food as well). I’d say this was the biggest motivator, and I’d like to think I was able to positively impact many students, whether they used our experiences to get gigs at other marketing agencies or get into their dream university programs. I had no idea what the term “entrepreneurship” meant until my first year of university, but I guess I did have some entrepreneurial tendencies. I never stuck with it, but I tried making niche Instagram pages, re-sold streetwear and was always jotting down some ideas (at one point, I tried working on something similar to Mylo, an app that invests in your spare change this was at the end of my grade 12 years) but I had no idea what I was doing. Reflecting on this, I particularly love thinking of ideas and having the creative freedom to express and execute on my ideas.  ‍",0,0
41," The original idea was actually completely different to what we ended up building. When we were building websites, I was actually pretty annoyed at the briefing process. I wanted to build a tool to help clients better communicate what they wanted in a website. I spoke to a bunch of web designers in our area about their process and bottlenecks. Almost every single one of them ended up focusing on getting content from clients. Not the brief. So basically, the idea was flipped on its head right away. As an agency, we could definitely relate to the problem, which made it fairly simple to think through and design something to make our own lives easier. Somewhere during our 8 years, our business kind of just fell into websites. Really, building and designing software has always been my number 1 business passion. That meant I had a ton of motivation to build this tool and make it our primary business. ‍",1,0
42," Paul, my cofounder, and I worked together for the last 5 years. During our time at our last company, we kept working on side projects that we felt were important to us. None of them worked until CopyAI. We’ve been fascinated by entrepreneurship and helping people find their passion in business. We realized that being creative is a muscle and requires a lot of work. When we saw what the latest AI algorithms like GPT-3 can do, we knew that they would be able to help lower the barriers of entrepreneurship. One earlier idea we tried was called ConceptHunt where we helped founders discover their next startup idea. It was a daily interactive newsletter for brainstorming. We would send a few fictitious business names and you would have to send us the business model back. Unfortunately, it didn’t go anywhere. We launched other ideas using GPT-3. Simplify.so did text condensing, we built a slack bot that was never released and we made taglines.ai to help businesses come up with their slogans. ‍",1,0
43," In 2004, I discovered computer software, artsy-type peers on the internet, heavy metal music, grunge fashion, and boys' ability to grow long hair (the start of my rebel going against everything teenage phase). In 2008, I spent one month in the hospital because of deep pain in the chest every time I breathed. Doctors never really figured out the diagnosis but assumed it was caused by anxiety in a school system where I felt I didn't fit in. I spent most of that time looking out of the hospital window at a lonely tree and wondering about life and stuff. A year later, I dropped out of art school, and I learned what my condition ""autodidact"" means. Then, I started teaching myself design. I founded my first business (graphic design studio) by helping out friends who played in rock bands by designing gig posters, album artworks, band logos, and Myspace layouts. In parallel, I tried to co-found another marketing agency startup. I failed fast because of a lack of money while bootstrapping. In 2014, I began traveling around Europe with nothing but a backpack, rollerskates, and freelance design gigs. My most extended stay was in Venice, Italy, where I lived with local art academy students. Two years later, I returned to Riga, Latvia, and co-founded a time management product startup. I failed fast because of personality conflicts between co-founders. In 2017, I accepted a creative director job offer at an advertising agency, and a year later, I quit the job because of shitty products I had to advertise, and my inner urge to still make f’n amazing sh!t happen through entrepreneurship. Soon, almost like from a scene of The Matrix movie, I met two bright gentlemen who later played a crucial role in my life as my business partners. We started working on a small startup idea called Corebook to disrupt how the industry creates and uses brand guidelines because it bothered us throughout our previous professional lives. In 2020, together with the other two co-founders, we managed to launch the public Beta of Corebook, officially registering the company as a legal entity and raising our first investment capital with a $1.2M valuation.

Corebook is now used in 30 countries by the most influential brand studios and world-renowned brands.",1,0
44," Cristina: Javier, Arnoldo & myself were working on another company founded by Javier. We were manufacturing slot machines for casinos and other venues. One evening, discussing the world and the radical transformation it experienced over the last decade, we began questioning ourselves which other industries were bound to be radically transformed by technology, and a light went on: insurance. None of us had any insurance industry experience, but we studied, we learned, we listened. After spending a couple of years in the startup scene of Silicon Valley, Javier decided to exit his slot machine company and went all in to start Crabi. It has been quite a learning experience. Once we had the idea, we invested months reading auto insurance contracts, understanding the terminology, learning about the business model, discovering the legal requirements to start an insurance company, understanding the regulations, etc. Our first and most important milestone was obtaining our Insurer´s License, awarded by the National Insurance & Surety Commission in Mexico. This achievement didn't come easy we had to grind for it for a little over two years. But once we were allowed to operate as an insurance company, we were thrilled. While going through this process ourselves, we understood how intricate this product is for an average person. This fueled our motivation to create something much more straightforward, fair, and transparent. We wanted to move away from the standard pricing approach by which a user is charged depending on its vehicle model & sociodemographics. Also, we tried to eliminate intermediation as commissions added up to 50% of the total price a user ends up paying for their policy. It is insane! Using technology & data analysis, we began creating customized pricing models that weren’t so focused on the vehicle characteristics but more on the person behind the steering wheel. Also, we created an intuitive app that allows our potential customers to quote & buy their auto insurance in less than 5 minutes, without depending on an insurance agent. We also focus on communicating our product characteristics, benefits, and rules of operation in a much more straightforward & easy to understand way. We aim to be as transparent as possible. At one point, we considered including a driving tracking device as part of our service to better understand our users. However, we had to pause this initiative due to high costs. Crabi has been bootstrapping its way through the car insurance world with excellent traction and valuable user insights without tech and product being the main focus. Now, we’ve managed to create great product teams with an incredible tech infrastructure this will ramp up our value and differentiate us tremendously from our competitors.‍ ‍Our initial idea was to focus on a Pay How You Drive model (PHY), which has proven successful in Europe & North America. However, tropicalizing this model to Mexico was difficult, mainly because the insurance culture in the country is minimal. This is why we had to back out from this idea and craft a model which was more familiar & appealing to our customers.",1,1
45," Five years ago, I had a side hustle where I would grow people's Instagram accounts. I got my clients anywhere between 2,000 and 5,000 new followers every month. Three years ago, Instagram started announcing policies that I knew would make that method not last. This is a natural thing with growth hacking. First, it works well. Then something changes and it does not work anymore. Creator Growth Lab helped Instagram creators to grow by themselves. They could log each day their growth tactics and measure how many followers they gained and their hashtag performance. Every single day you could go to the Lab and see your growth. Then figure out which was the best one. Optimize it and grow more. ‍",0,0
46, I was working at Uber HQ as an Account Executive helping launch the UberEats app in Boston and Providence. I came home for the holiday break and one night was up late with my brother Greg Meade and childhood friend Mike Delpapa. Mike just graduated from NorthEastern with an engineering degree and wanted to invent something. We sat up all night writing down the most ridiculous ideas and then four-way volleyball was proposed. We quickly realized it was not as ridiculous as we thought! ,1,0
47," So in March 2020, right near the start of the pandemic, I injured my ulnar nerve. Frustratingly, I found I wasn’t able to type without pain. For several months, I could only type for a couple of minutes before my elbow would start burning. It was a tricky predicament to be in as a software developer! Fortunately, I was able to find a way to be productive without the use of my hands, and after about 8 months, I regained the ability to type. But the experience was harrowing, and it taught me a valuable lesson: life is short, and being able-bodied is temporary. I had been pretty happy working as a staff software engineer, but I wanted to create my own thing. I imagined myself following in the footsteps of Wes Bos or Kent C. Dodds, becoming a full-time educator. So over the summer of last year, I left my job at Gatsby Inc. and started work on CSS for JavaScript Developers! I chose to focus on CSS because I know so many JS developers who find CSS frustrating. Ask a typical React or Vue developer, and they’ll tell you that their least favorite part of the job is writing CSS. A lot of us really don’t like working with CSS 😅 CSS isn’t inherently bad, though! It’s a really elegant language. The problem is that it’s implicit. The rules of the language are concealed, and if you don’t understand those rules, you’re not going to have a good time. So the goal for my course is to change that relationship, to help folks realize that CSS can be a lot of fun! It’s a pretty lofty goal, but I wanted to pick something that would be high-impact and long-lasting. I’m excited by the prospect of helping developers realize the elegance of CSS and hopefully make it as fun for them as JavaScript is!",1,0
48," I wasn’t single when I moved to The Netherlands to start my MBA, but the relationship ended shortly after I relocated to Europe. I started using dating apps and the user experience was (and remains) incredibly frustrating. The basic business model of freemium dating apps (which is the vast majority of the market) is to introduce friction and charge users to remove it. This fundamentally puts the core interest of users (meeting people) at odds with the dating app’s business model. I thought there was a better way to build a dating app and started from a business perspective on the problem (by the way, this sounds logical but was a fundamental error). What if a dating app, in its very design, had aligned interests with the users? That was the fundamental principle in starting Cuddli: it started with a business idea (which I still think is a good one) and worked backward from that into finding a market, rather than starting with a motivated group of users and finding a workable business model from there. I also sought feedback from investors. They raised all sorts of (valid) problems with dating apps, such as the audience constantly changing, user churn (people had no reason to continue using an app after they met), etc. We solved for virtually all of these in the app design.

49," As I quickly talked about before, I graduated from Kennesaw State University (KSU) in 2010 with a degree in Criminal Justice/Cybercrime and was immediately hired as a full-time employee from my college internship at a Criminal Data provider. These are the companies that provide Criminal Data to investigators, background check companies, and more.  As I was always techy, the next year I was accepted to the Master’s program at Southern Poly State University (Now KSU) for Software Engineer. After a year I dropped out due to financial situations and YouTube being a better teacher than my professors.  After a decade, moving up into a managerial role, building a failing betting app, and then the birth of my first son later, I moved on to work for the soon to be 9th fastest growing tech company in North America, bringing in over $800,000 in sales monthly (while also having a couple of side-gigs). This is where I learned structure in selling to consumers, handling rejection, and most importantly, measuring and analyzing the right data to scale efficiently. In addition, the importance of online reputation management, SEO, and streamlining 3rd party lead generation tools.  In late 2018 I was given an opportunity to jump back into the HR field selling to enterprise companies at one of the most infamous background screening firms in the nation. Here I leveraged business trips and built as many relationships with successful business owners as possible. I learned the importance of strategic partnerships and started to mold myself into an industry leader.  Through my 2+ decades of experience working in multiple industries, startups, small and medium-sized businesses, I made sure to learn from their mistakes as well as what helped them overcome their biggest hurdles. This provided me a great path for success as well as an open mind to possible failures.  ‍",1,0
50," Before setting up DeluxeMaid, I was part of the ESTEEM graduate program at the university of Notre Dame. The program focussed on bootstrapping businesses and removed obstacles I previously thought would be impossible to overcome when setting up a business. I previously thought substantial investment would be required to even get the business off the ground but the ESTEEM program taught how much easier it was to just set something up to see if it stuck. Interestingly, I didn’t go straight from ESTEEM to running DeluxeMaid and initially worked as an engineer at a large motor company. I left the job after less than a year just a few months after setting up DeluxeMaid. The company was only generating around $1k monthly revenues at the time but I was determined to make a real go of it and give it my full attention. I pretty much hated my engineering job and I figured it was better to be at the bottom of a ladder I wanted to climb rather than be halfway up a ladder I had no interest in. ‍",1,0
51," Stubbornness, mostly. In my last year at university, I got invited to work as the main content guy of a gaming/esports startup. We partnered up with one of the biggest esports teams in the world at that time (Na’Vi) and created the first premium educational platform for the Dota 2 video game. Long story short, the startup showed promise but was ultimately unsuccessful due to lack of funding and most importantly – mismanagement caused by our total lack of experience. The founder of said startup eventually quit, but I wasn’t ready to give up because I saw a lot of potential. I wanted to make something useful out of all the knowledge I had accumulated from the project. And on a deeper, personal level – fear. I was terrified by the thought that I might have to find a traditional job. I had an MSc in Finance, so the local big banks were my most likely employer. Yet, every time I went into a bank branch, the atmosphere of soul-crushing bureaucracy haunted me. Accepting a job there seemed like death to me. I was clinging to the idea of working on this startup as a drowning man clings to a piece of floating wood. Not because I wanted to be rich or famous or anything, but because I wanted to make a living out of something interesting and stimulating to me on a day-to-day basis to keep my soul alive. So – stubbornness and fear. The most inspirational of motivations.  (P.S. I’ve grown a bit wiser now and am aware that first, not all 9-to-5 jobs are soul-crushing, and second - there are many ways one can keep their soul alive even in a not-that-stimulating 9-to-5 job. Third, the idea of working on something you’re passionate about is a bit romantic and divorced from reality, but that’s a different topic and I’m struggling to avoid writing a 5k word essay on each one of your questions.) ‍",0,0
52," When I graduated high school, I launched a healthy meal delivery/catering company (called “Slim Pickins Meals”) from my parent’s kitchen. This was my first “real” business operation where I learned about things like payroll, overhead, COGS, delegation, marketing/sales KPIs + much more. ‍ I eventually moved into a commercial kitchen space as I outgrew my parent’s home kitchen (and they wanted their kitchen back on the weekends). While I was running that company, I started helping other business owners at my church run social media advertising campaigns as I had built up a solid knowledge base from managing advertising campaigns for my own company. It started out as very part-time but organically grew to the point where my consulting business was generating more profit than my catering company. I then eventually decided to shut down the catering company so I could focus on growing my consulting company full-time. I came to this decision in part because of the low-overhead business model that the consulting company offered, the improved work/life balance, and my strengths as an entrepreneur aligned more with this business.

53," I grew up extremely poor in public housing projects, but I managed to move out when I was 18 and I’ve never been back. I spent most of my 20s doing two things: drinking to excess and boxing. The former almost destroy my potential to go far in the latter, however, I eventually quit for good on December 23rd, 2013. Recovered addicts never forget their sobriety date.  Drinking was my “keystone habit”. Once I knocked that one out, the rest followed. Now I could focus on being an even better fighter, writer, and eventually earn my degree in Physics. During this time, I had been writing about all aspects of my life and journey on my website. I’ve always wanted to have a blog and be a writer, but I had trouble finding my “voice”. As a result, the blogs never quite took off or I lost interest. The thing that made this blog stick is that I found my voice—writing about what I’d learned the hard way with the intention of making sure that other people could learn it the easy way. Because I’d overcome so many challenges (grew up in poverty, struggled and overcame alcoholism, won national titles as an amateur boxer, boxed professionally, and earned a physics degree to name few things), I believed that my perspective was authentic and that I could help many people with it. ‍",1,0
54," Eloquis was all about bringing personalization to mobile apps. What I saw was that the web evolved from being hello user to “Hello Bob, it’s great to meet you on a wonderful December day” - whereas the mobile app was the same except for the social app e.g. FB, Twitter, 4Square etc. The rest of the apps treated the user very transactionally. We thought a way to remedy that was to offer a personalization platform and humanize the apps.  ",0,0
55," I'm a first-time founder, and the idea behind Embarque came about in a chat that I had with Dominic Monn in May 2020. As the founder of MentorCruise, Dominic was looking to scale his SEO content production efforts but hated the process of looking for writers. So he pitched the idea of me launching a content writing marketplace.  I found it interesting but quickly realized that it would take a long time to see profitability with that business model. It also still wouldn't eliminate the vetting process completely. Platforms like Fiverr and Upwork can be interesting, but people's skills in writing, editing, and content strategy can vary widely. Content mills tend to produce spun content of subpar quality, underpay their writers and are often involved in shady practices that I don't want to be part of. Eventually, I stumbled upon the productized service business model employed by some of the competitors in the content marketing niche. It was perfect for Embarque. Productizing our content marketing services allows us to show our pricing transparently, focus on being good at selected key offerings, and scale our growth through these services. On the operations side, we can look for and vet talented writers to make sure that our clients get quality content, on time.",1,0
56," My co-founder, Thushaan, and I would often walk back home from university together and talk about how we never have enough time to do all the things we want. As engineers, we wanted to solve this and realized that traditional watches don’t show you how to best use your time. We set out to design a simple and effective tool to change our mindset in regards to productivity and time. As students, procrastination often plagued our days and was the cause of unachieved goals. We wanted something that constantly reminded us of our priorities and what we should be doing with our time. The idea was born out of a joke of thinking of making a deathwatch, one that would count down to your death. But we then realized that it would be really interesting to play on the psychology of scarcity to make our minds realize how valuable and irreversible time is. We decided to make use of technology to help change behavior. Keeping it as simple an idea as possible we wanted to bring something fresh to the watch industry which is either saturated with smartwatches that all do the same thing or traditional watches which show you nothing but present time. We’re charged to change people’s attitude towards time and convince them that there is an even better way of looking at it. ‍",1,0
57," Before I started Encharge, I was working on another SaaS tool – HeadReach, a lead generation tool.  HeadReach was generating $2,000 in MRR, and we had a few thousand users. Just as we started growing HeadReach, Google emailed us that they’re closing the Site Search API – the primary “technology” we use to find leads. Long story short, we sold HeadReach to one of our competitors for a small fee. After HeadReach I felt miserable for a year. I was bouncing from project to project without any traction. That feeling when you don’t have a clue what product to start building. It very much resembles a sickness. Then we decided we’re going to validate new ideas with Slav. It took us at least 5 or 6 startups until we stopped on Encharge. We started building Encharge in October last year, and we just launched our closed Beta. Launching the Open Beta in a few weeks. The idea for Encharge came from my pains as a marketer at startup companies.  Integrating the whole marketing stack is hard.  In every startup that I worked at it took at least 2 developers and a few weeks until we had the right setup to execute powerful lifecycle marketing campaigns. Every time I tried to make the CRM, emails, in-app events, landing pages, and other tools work together, I failed. I had to resort to ugly hacks, and eventually involve a dev team.  That’s why most early-stage startups and even mature SaaS companies default to sending one-off email blasts and don’t do anything beyond that.  They simply don’t have the right data and set up to do something more holistic. We thought we could change that with Encharge by building a simple to use tool that connects with you marketing apps and allows you to create powerful marketing workflows.",1,0
58," Endeavorun is oddly a perfect blend of my own background. I’m a serious runner, an industrial-organizational psychologist and executive coach, and even spent many of my younger years working at summer camps.  The idea came much more organically, however, than simply trying to amalgamate my various interests. The inspiration came from a friend, well-known fitness author Matt Fitzgerald, who had spent a summer living with a professional running team based in Arizona. Matt was already a sport guru but was amazed by how much he learned simply by being immersed with pro athletes. We talked about how much average adults could benefit from an experience like that and tried to distill it into something far more accessible.  Originally, we wanted to create a longer-term running program that was much more comprehensive than a running retreat. But when Covid derailed our original plans, it also allowed us to revisit what the market was clamoring for, and that’s how we arrived at our current vision.  While I do run my consulting firm, I can’t say that I leveraged any specific hard skills from that experience into the creation of Endeavorun. However, there’s no doubt that my background has heavily influenced everything from our external branding to our programmatic design. In particular, my graduate training in adult learning has prepared me to design the retreats with real intent. It enables me to create the workshop elements of our retreat in keeping with the highest standards of professional learning and development programs, rather than simply throwing together a schedule based on convenience and hoping activities are “fun”. That part of my academic background hopefully gives our retreats a unique flavor. ",1,0
59," My co-founder, Callum, originally came up with the idea of making adventure activities more accessible. After going surfing in Scarborough in Winter (I know, right?), he was surprised to see how difficult it was to find more adventures to go on. At the time, I wasn’t looking for a new position, having recently closed down my web development agency. I was tired of the over-hype that came with starting a startup. But when I saw Callum’s job ad, it was quite different. It was realistic and down to earth. Callum had an idea which he thought could work, and he wanted a partner to help build it. From the outset, we had the mindset that we’re almost certainly going to fail, but every day we’re going to try our damned hardest to make sure that’s not the case. We realised pretty rapidly that the main reason that the huge, multi-hundred billion dollar activities industry is primarily offline is due to lack of decent tools and automation. We were going to change that. ‍",1,0
60," I’ve always wanted to start my own business. At the time, I was already running an Anime lifestyle brand. We sold graphic tees and posters. But I quickly realized that it wasn’t scalable. The profit margins were not enjoyable and the need for inventory made it hard to consistently realize a certain level of profit. I started gravitating towards software after I met people who were making a livable wage off their software assets. And considering that their profit margins were much higher and also the fact that their expenses were a little more manageable, it was too tempting to resist not considering. Another thing I loved about the idea of Eventloot is the fact, that if we got it running properly we’d basically have a system for recurring income that didn’t require us to trade our time for money. Eventloot just happened to be an idea I came up with after I ran into an event planner who told me she still used spreadsheets and email to manage her events. It could have been anything depending on the type of person I ran into that day. ‍ What part of your background defines you, and possibly led to starting Eventloot? I am a software engineer by trade. I don’t consider myself to be a great software engineer. But the one thing I can say about myself is that I have become fairly resourceful due to my experience with starting entrepreneurial ventures. I know where to find the right freelancers to help us achieve a goal. ‍ Before Eventloot, what were you doing? Before Eventloot, I was running an anime lifestyle brand (I still am) and I had a day job (I still do). My day job involved writing software that ran on Point of Sale systems. ‍ Did you have any failed or previous businesses? Before Eventloot, I built a trading platform for college students while still in college. It was a massive failure mainly because we didn’t code it in a scalable way. It was written in PHP and HTML with an SQL DB. That’s not the problem, the problem was that we wrote almost everything in two-three files and we wrote all our queries by hand. It was awful whenever we found a bug that needed fixing. ‍ Did any big life events lead to starting Eventloot? Not really, Eventloot is just a product of my desire to be my own boss. And that desire started after I sat in on a group of NCstate alumni talking about how they started their own company. ‍ How did the idea come to you? Eventloot came to me after talking to an event planner who was trying to invite me to a valentine’s event she was organizing. It was after asking her how she managed her business that I realize that there might be an opportunity there. ‍",0,0
61," My primary motivation to start ExploreVR.net was to create a highly profitable online business. Inspired by the successes of sites like Airbnb, Yelp, and TripAdvisor, I became very keen on the idea of User Generated Content (such as product reviews) as a source of providing value to customers. I thought that if I married some basic information about VR businesses with some user generated content, I couldn’t help but win. I believe that people appreciate having a central “hub” location where there is a lot of user content on a specific topic along the lines of old-school messaging boards and sites like Reddit. My initial hope was that my topic was niche and timely enough to not have any well-established players already in it. In early 2017 I volunteered on a grassroots political campaign as a member of their technology team. These guys were doing something I thought was pretty neat. They were using WordPress with a few customizations to create a full-featured online app. So that got me thinking – I have a core business idea for a product, and a low-cost means of creating that product, possibly all by myself. I made the connection between those two things in my mind and got to work. I didn’t have any previous WordPress experience, but I thought – “this can’t be that hard”. And it wasn’t that hard. Just time-consuming. So, I went for it. I knew right out of the gate that my chances of success as a first-time entrepreneur were against me, so I decided to do it part-time while keeping my day job. That was a good decision. My standard of living (financially) didn’t suffer, and I got to follow my dream at the same time. That was great. ‍",0,0
62," I’d always had the idea that I’d like to try running my own business, though I’d never really thought about exactly what this meant or what kind of business. Over the last couple of years, I’d started to become disillusioned with the corporate/business world that I’d been working in for the last 15 years. Last summer I decided this wasn’t a long-term option for me so I quit my job and took the plunge to launch my own startup business. Having recently been through the process of buying a house I’d had the seed of an idea to build a platform that helps house buyers, I was amazed at how disjointed and difficult the process was and I guess my idea was to build a kind of LinkedIn for house buying, something that would provide the advice and guidance on what to do when buying a house, would connect you with professionals and allow you to manage everything all in one place. A lot of the jobs I’d held were around analyzing and improving processes for organizations and I wanted to apply this to something myself so this seemed like a good opportunity to do so. On a personal level, I guess I also wanted more flexibility about how and when I worked and believed launching my own startup would offer this too. I really had no idea about how to launch a business or what to do, however, I learned pretty quickly the importance of diving in and giving it a go! It’s important to be prepared and do your research, but at some point, you just need to get out there, make the mistakes and learn from them for the next time! ‍",0,0

Studying their needs, we discovered that they were missing a solution to consolidate all product reviews spread across many online stores. It was an AHA moment for us.

64," The idea for Festivilia was inspired by 2 experiences. The first was with an encounter with an Egyptian filmmaker, Ramy El Gabry, in 2016 while I was still running Hubrif. The other was my personal experience with submitting my films to film festivals. I stumbled upon Ramy’s short film, From Inside, and was really moved by the storyline. I then reached out to the filmmaker to get the film featured on Hubrif and it became the most watched film on the platform at that time. From my years of attending film festivals, I felt the film would be a perfect match for some festivals and decided to submit the film on his behalf. To both our surprise the film was selected by almost all the film festivals that I had submitted it to, including the 2016 Africa International Film Festival where we both finally met. On one of the days of the festival, Ramy and I were discussing and then he said that what I did for him was a great service that many filmmakers would gladly pay for.  Fast forward 3 years later, Festivilia is the official Festival Distributor for all of Divine Touch Productions films (Ramy’s production company).  The second experience was that I have always had a problem with filling numerous submission forms of film festivals to submit my film to festivals. With an acceptance rate of less than 5%, I find the whole process very inefficient and time wasting. Over time, other submission platforms like filmfreeway and withoutabox made the process less frustrating by building a marketplace for filmmakers and film festival alike, but I realized the issue of time spent on these platforms sieving through different festivals rules and regulations to see which festivals your film is a perfect match for hasn't been close to being solved. I didn't want to spend 100 of hours monthly doing this activity but would rather find a platform that can help me do all the hard work (Source for the right festivals and submit on my behalf) and I pay for the service. There was none in existence. I decided to solve my problem. These 2 experiences were the fire that sparked the idea for Festivilia. ‍",1,0

We decided to explore the future of work management, and I led a team of 5 people to dig into this problem for about 6 months. I already had deep experience in this domain, and we accumulated tons of feedback at Targetprocess, so we started from scratch essentially.  After the first 6 months, we decided to build something cool and innovative and switched from prototyping to development.   Our main goal was to create a tool that could grow with the company. Most tools can’t survive the growth, and a company has to switch them.

66," I had already been experimenting with affiliate marketing and creating websites for quite a few years before I started Financer.com. I had created 400 websites and trialed different kinds of monetization for them, such as Google ads, and confirmed to myself this was what I wanted to do long-term.  But I didn’t have a real focus because I hadn’t found an idea I was passionate about yet until I created Financer.com. I could see how much value it was giving to people, which was a huge motivation to turn it into something bigger. I had a vision for a global business model with websites in different countries, but it was clear the only way to make all of this happen was to let go of some of my other projects and do what I had never done before: focus.  This turned out to be a huge turning point for the business and I now advise any entrepreneurs out there who are balancing lots of projects but not feeling fulfilled to choose the one they care about most and give it 100%.  ",1,0
67," Prior to joining India’s top-ranked B-school - IIM Ahmedabad where I met my partners and Flexiple’s co-founders - Karthik and Hrishikesh, I had been working for 3 years at HUGE corporations which had thousands of employees across the globe, leading me to have a clearly defined role. However, I was never satisfied with my pace of learning during these three years. While at my first job, I found that the focus was more on just sticking to what has been done since the birth of the company, which led me to look for a switch. At my second job, I figured that learning only hard skills such as data analytics is not as fulfilling as I thought it would be. In this search of learning opportunities, I explored the option of working with Karthik and Hrishikesh for a period of three months. The intention was to learn more about technology and entrepreneurship than what textbooks could teach me. Now, we have been working together on Flexiple for three and a half years now.  During this period, Flexiple has undergone multiple iterations. We started out as an automated platform built for scale which was ultimately not used by anyone. We tried out a pure-play service model and within a couple of weeks landed our first client, which ultimately resulted in us scrapping the platform completely. During this time, we decided to double down our focus on startups who were looking to hire remote full-time freelance talent. Having learned the importance of creating value before looking for a sale, we launched remote.tools which aims to be the platform where remote workers interact with each other. ",1,0
68," Immediately, after my time at JPMorgan, I wasn’t entirely sure what I wanted to do next. But, when I got through the top MBA university in India, I felt that it might give me the time to explore my next steps. But on joining the MBA school, the noise around job placements pushed me towards starting something of my own. So, I used to carry around an idea book noting down different ideas that I felt I would enjoy working on. In the process, I recognized that B2B was the space where I would like to spend my time building a startup. Of the many ideas, I found Flexiple to be the most interesting because: Most other freelance marketplaces catered to the “gig economy” - where quality is not the focus, rather the volume is. Whereas, Flexiple plays in the “talent economy” where quality is at the core of everything we do and I felt there was still a huge opportunity there.Further, I believed that the future would involve more & more people being focused on building individual brands vs. just being a small cog of a larger monolithic company.Also, tech as a functional vertical was continuing to grow massively in size - all startups have tech as their backbone. Top this with the fact that hiring in tech is just brutally painful. So, we recognized a real problem - building a high-quality tech talent network that can help startups & companies in hiring. The question was largely about whether we could execute and make things happen. ",1,0
69," Before founding Flexy Global, I co-founded a cross-platform photo editor which was available on the web, Android, and iOS. I was the CEO of a diverse 20+ team and enjoyed taking care of the product.  As a product owner, I was constantly searching for creative, ambitious designers and design agencies. What I understood during these five years as an entrepreneur, is that finding a good UI/UX designer or agency is just pure luck. In 2020, our company exited as we sold our photo editor and we decided to start our digital design agency. Finding a UI/UX design agency or freelancer that is talented, can design a great user-friendly product, is responsible, and time-sensitive is practically an insurmountable task. Most of the top agencies have a 6-figure price tag that not many companies and startups can afford. But, we believe that the world can be a better place with more user-friendly products that help people make better decisions for themselves and society. That is why we came up with the name Flexy. We provide each client with a flexible approach to the design, support, and imprint a part of our company’s spark, our ‘DNA,’ onto their product. It is so rewarding to see a client amazed when they discover the cool design concept we prepared for them.  Besides the cross-platform photo editor, I also co-founded the first-ever deep fake mobile app on the market. I had to shut that project down because working on two products at once was rather exhausting at the time. Aside from that, we were having a very long review cycle for the app updates as we couldn’t make improvements fast enough and that is why we decided to focus on one product. What were the lessons I learned by that time? Well, people tend to look for an option B to succeed, but that is defocusing you from the need to put ‘all the eggs into one basket’ to flourish. If you have enough money and human resources then it is not a problem but, if you need to allocate your time on two different initiatives, you can't succeed against competitors who devote themselves full-time. ‍",1,0
70," The main idea is quite old and evolved out of discussions with friends at university. The main pain point we had at that time was that Facebook just entered the German market and we experienced firsthand what it means to have all your messages and friends stuck in the data silo of studiVZ, which was the German copycat that was used before Facebook. The basis of all product iterations was always that we tried to build something that lets you own your data but still take part in mainstream social media with normal non-nerdy friends. First prototypes were before diaspora but similar federated social networks. We quickly learned that support for all data types (images, events etc.) was too much, so we focused on the most important one: messages. The second learning that led to the product idea was that replacing the status quo was impossible so we focused on building a professional messaging product that used existing messaging channels like Facebook and email. ‍",0,0
71," We had the idea while we were in high school. We were making lists of problems we thought would be interesting to solve. The advice we had heard was to find a problem you have yourself, and then figure out how to solve that. We were sitting in English class one day and our teacher mentioned that somebody needed to make it easier to automatically format papers. We had a little bit of money and we learned about Upwork and Fiverr. Building a website couldn't be that hard. We hired someone to do that. It was 2013 and we spent the next five years building different versions of that website, learning how to write code, learning how to design, learning how to hire people only to find out at the end that you have to have an idea that you can relate to and that you can solve well, but also has to be able to make money. It was incredibly valuable, and I have no regrets. We had a blast. ‍",0,0
72," I hail from a lower-middle-class family in a small town but I have always been a curious and aspirational person since my childhood. In our society, if you are an above-average student you either go for engineering or medical for your undergraduate studies. I chose engineering as I liked maths and went on to prepare for JEE (Entrance examination for getting into prestigious engineering colleges IITs). After failing once and in my final attempt, I got into IIT Delhi (top 3 engineering college of India). College was a lot of fun, I got to explore my identity after seeing people from diverse backgrounds. Also, I got to learn about entrepreneurship for the first time while doing my first internship for a startup that was operating from the dorm room of my college in 2013. After that, I tried to start my own company and after trying multiple ideas, when nothing evolved into something tangible and with a lot of pressure from family, I was forced to take up a supply chain consulting job through campus placements.  Even after joining the job, I used to try to be updated on what was happening in the startup ecosystem and tried to brainstorm ideas on weekends. A few months later, I was exposed to the conditions of the Indian farmers when I saw hunger strikes and farmer rallies happening all over the country. Looking at this, I realized that it was the inefficiency and unfair practices involved in this sector that lead to low farmer incomes. I started researching this field with the idea of connecting farmers directly to markets. After a few months of working part-time on this project, I finally decided to take this up full-time by quitting my job. The initial idea was called FarmConnect and consisted on connecting farmers to markets. I was working on this with a high school student who was passionate about entrepreneurship too. But later on, it didn’t work out and I was left with no job and no co-founder.  But I kept working on the idea and started talking to people in my network who were working on solving similar problems. One of my seniors from IIT Delhi connected me to Amit Kashyap, who was also my senior at college. After graduating from IIT Delhi in Electrical Engineering, Amit started his career with Honeywell Aerospace as a Senior Engineer in 2015. As he worked on system engineering techniques for Aircraft Maintenance IT Solutions, Amit always wanted to work for society and create an impact. This led him to the conditions of Indian Agricultural Producers and he grew passionate about this cause. On gaining a fair understanding of the inefficiency in this sector, he started working on bringing markets closer to the producers. Around the same time I got in touch with him and after a few discussions and debates in the initial stage, I and Amit decided to go ahead with the idea of FreshConnect. Prior to FreshConnect, while in college, there was an important moment in my entrepreneurship journey. In my second year, a guy with a diary in his hand knocked on my door. He explained to me that he had a business opportunity that didn't require investing a lot of money or resources. It was a multilevel marketing business, where you earned passive income by growing your network just like the Amway model. In my desperation to do something, I thought this was a sign and I took the opportunity by spending INR15000 of my college scholarship on that. This guy later convinced me to spend INR25000 more, so as to be able to get success faster. It was all logical for me at that point, so I did invest all my scholarship amount of that semester. Unlike other MLM companies, they were giving products worth the same amount I was investing, but the problem is that no one needed them. On top of that, I flunked my studies to completely focus on my business and justified it by looking at examples like Bill Gates who dropped out of college to start their business. I performed very poorly that semester, lost my scholarship money and soured a lot of relationships with my friends by selling this opportunity to them. This also hurt my mental health as I went into mild depression (without knowing it). I was ashamed of myself because of this failure and I didn’t tell my parents about this until everything fell apart.  But this experience taught me a lot of life lessons:  It's not worth fulfilling your ambitions at the cost of precious relationships. That I am good at sales. I did great in selling memberships as the first time selling something. I used to show them the big picture after trying to understand their motivations in life then. I should not put all the eggs in one basket especially in the case of startups which are very risky endeavors. There should be a fine balance of emotion & rationalism while making these decisions.",0,0
73," I started thinking about the idea behind Friday in 2013. At the time, I had just left a company because I didn’t have a great relationship with my manager. I was struggling at work, but didn’t feel comfortable bringing this up because he didn’t ask, “how are things going?” The best managers I had in the past had regular 1-1s and would ask questions on a regular basis. After this experience, I thought there was a way one could build software to help managers improve the communication and feedback loop between employees/leaders. Unlike a busy manager, a computer would never forget to ask questions as long as it was programmed correctly. I sat on the idea for a couple of years, pitching the idea to friends and executives. People seemed to like the idea, but I didn’t have a working product at the time so I wasn’t able to determine if this was a good/bad idea. Finally, in late 2015 I decided that it was time to stop thinking about the idea and time to start building something. I guess they call this making the transition from a wantrepreneur to an entrepreneur :) Over time, the idea has adapted. I tried selling the product as a “manager sidekiq” and experienced some success with it (growing to $10k/mo as a side project), but I constantly felt like I was missing out on something much better. Around this time last year, I was reflecting on a variety of data points from customers, advisors, and my own personal experience and came to the conclusion that we could create a customizable tool to run any regular communication event/update at work. Instead of being a tool to improve the employee <-> manager relationship, this could be a tool to help you create communication habits at work. Things clicked for me and I became excited about the idea. At the time, this was still a night/weekend project for me, but I knew that I needed to make the jump and go full-time on this. The way I look at the market is that there’s plenty of tools that improve the efficiency of workplace communication. Slack makes it easy to chat with coworkers. Zoom makes it easier to have video calls. But there’s a need to help you create a better communication process. It’s not enough to have the tools. You need to think about your process as well. It’s like having plumbing in your house, but not having pumps to regulate the flow of water. This pivot was risky, but I’m so glad we did it. The best part is that we were able to bring over many existing customers to this new product and they are using the product more than they have in the past. That feels really good. It validates our shift in direction.",1,0
74," My background is actually in sports, exercise, and nutrition! I played a lot of sports growing up—basketball in particular. When I went to university, I studied Sport & Exercise Science. After uni, I set up a personal training business in my hometown of Cambridge. I enjoyed running my own business, but personal training wasn’t the right career for me. I enjoyed staying active and eating well, but I realized it wasn’t my passion. I still enjoyed a beer and a pizza a bit too often! As soon as I had that realization, I knew I needed to find a new path. But all the ideas I was having were for online businesses. I didn’t have the money to spend on getting someone else to build something, so I decided to self-teach. Back then, Lynda.com was the big platform, so I got stuck in learning Ruby on Rails over there. Very early on, I was watching a YouTube video when I came across a company called General Assembly. They had a 3-month full-time bootcamp based in London where you learn the fundamentals of web development with the view of becoming a professional developer. After completing the course, I got a job as a front-end developer. After a year or so of being a professional, I came back to GA on a part-time basis (evenings and weekends). I started as a teaching assistant on top of my full-time job. I hadn’t written a line of code until I was 28 years old, so I had a sense that there was some serious ground to make up. Teaching others was a strategy I knew would help move me forward faster while also getting myself back into the GA community, meeting others, and building my confidence as a developer. Another year on, and I felt ready to start teaching the courses and workshops I had been an assistant for. GA was happy for me to move up to become a part-time lead instructor, and so I started teaching the courses myself! It was through this teaching experience that the idea for Frontend Mentor came to me. At this point, I had been trying (and failing miserably) to launch a new fitness-related online business. I had been building an app for over half a year and still hadn’t launched anything, validated the idea, or even figured out a route to market. Out of frustration, I challenged myself to ship an unrelated idea in a couple of days.  The first idea that popped into my head was a front-end resource list for my students! Not original, I know, but it was something that was needed. I constantly shared the same front-end resources with my students, but I had no central resource to point them to. So I decided to create it. “Frontend Mentor” seemed like a good name, plus the .io domain was available, the person who owned the .com wasn’t using it, and the social handles were all available. So I got to work! After a couple of days, I had created my resource list and shared it with my network on LinkedIn, my students in General Assembly’s Slack channel, and the various (brand new) Frontend Mentor social channels. I received a bunch of positive feedback and thank you notes, which gave me a massive boost! It also made me think more about creating stuff for developers. After thinking more about typical problems my students had, I came up with another idea. A common question my students had when completing our Front-end Web Development 10-week part-time course was, “Where can I go to practice building projects and build up a portfolio?”. My first piece of advice was to build their projects and build sites for friends. However, they would come back by saying something along the lines of “But I’m no good at design. Anything I make looks amateurish. Where can I go to get designs?”. My second recommendation was to go to Dribbble, find a design, and build it in code. But many students would come back and say it was hard to find designs to work to, and once they did, the assets weren’t included, so it was hard to recreate the designs. When I was thinking about other difficulties for my students, my mind jumped to this problem. Why didn’t a website exist that provides developers with professional designs complete with starter code and optimized assets? That would remove so much friction and allow developers to focus on writing code with the additional benefit of creating beautiful-looking projects that would look great in any portfolio. So this is how Frontend Mentor was born!",1,0
75," I remember when I was 8 and I got my first computer that’s when I fell in love with technology. From games to hardware to software and everything in between. When I was 13 I started practicing coding and after a couple years graphic design. Before I turned 18 I launched a web design company with an older friend of mine and pitched our services to businesses while “having a website” was trending in Greece at that time. As soon as I graduated from an American high school in Athens Greece I went to study Shipping and Finance at BCA a London Metropolitan backed University in Athens. I got my BSc served 12 months in the Greek Navy which is mandatory and at the same time, I was working on a couple different blogs that I had with Cassie Ousta, my partner. As soon as I got my BSc I went to work for a shipping company for less than a year which is when I realized that I had to do something creative and something related to tech so I rented an office right across the shipping company that I was working part-time and launched a Media agency with my best friend Mike Chliounakis. We were focusing on Digital Advertising, Graphic and Web Design, Branding, etc. and at the same time, we were running the 2 blogs that I was working on with my partner Cassie. That’s when we came up with the idea of Gadget Flow on August 15th, 2012. We were struggling to find high-quality products online without having to read 1,000-word reviews or scrolling for hours on Amazon and we wanted to create a product discovery platform in which we’d surface great products every day! As soon as we launched Gadget Flow it took off organically. Therefore, I had to quit my part-time job in shipping and close the media agency in order to focus 100% on Gadget Flow.",1,0
76," A few years ago I was getting more and more interested in affiliate marketing. While I was running various online magazines at that time, I didn’t have much experience with affiliate sites. However, one day I stumbled upon a gaming site which was promoting several online games. I liked the idea and did some research. I noticed that various affiliate programs were paying good commission just for leads where users would sign up to play an online game for free (the companies were monetizing the games by selling in-game items or other goodies). I thought if I would be able to scale my own gaming site to a reasonable amount of traffic, then this could pay off very well. At least that’s what I thought. ‍",0,0
77," I come from an entrepreneurial family -- my mother and father have been running a metal fabrication business for more than 30 years. Ever since my teenage years, I’ve been running with different business ideas. In the eBay glory days of the early 2000s, I would try and fund my social life by buying and selling whatever I could get my hands on -- from bread baskets, to cameras and concert tickets. I ended up getting my father’s company eBay account banned… who knew that reselling concert tickets was against TOS!?  After a stint working for an artificial intelligence company in Paris (VirtuOz - acquired by Nuance), I spent 4 years at Google where I tried a couple of other ventures, including a Google Adwords PPC agency and one my mother was most proud of -- a monthly condom subscription company! Neither really got off the ground. While Google was an incredible learning experience, I was always getting itchy feet and found myself looking for something that could better cater to my entrepreneurial mind. Through some networking, I found the co-founders of a small mobile advertising company called Vungle -- fellow Brits, they had just moved to San Francisco for an incubator called AngelPad. They were pre-launch and pre-revenue, with a tiny team -- I took a gamble on joining them and hastily moved to San Francisco from London in 2012. Vungle (later acquired by Blackstone) gave me the incredible opportunity to build a hugely successful global company from scratch, leading an organization across 5 global locations and witnessing ‘rocketship’ type growth that doesn’t come around often. As exciting as it was to play a leadership role, I always had the desire to do it as CEO -- so after close to 4 years I left Vungle, moved to Seattle with my wife and started GawkBox with an old Vungle colleague shortly after. The idea for GawkBox came out of our vast experience in the mobile advertising market from Vungle. We had a lot of relationships in that space which allowed us to identify a pain point -- back at the start of 2016 that pain point was working with influencers to scale user acquisition. We envisaged building a new type of mobile ad network but focused on influencers.  ",0,0
78," The concept for GenM originated while I was struggling to find help as a small business owner. I would hire volunteer students to help me grow, and ended up employing many. These were students who were struggling to find jobs because they lacked work experience. After working with me and my businesses they became hireable and were able to launch their careers. I thought nothing of this for over 5 years as I worked with more and more students most of whom went on to launch successful careers. Eventually, I decided to switch out of construction and into the tech industry. It was one of the toughest decisions of my life because I knew nothing of tech beforehand. I had lots of logical reasons for switching but mostly it was because I was drawn to infinite possibilities that you can design and build through technology. A few years ago, my co-founders and I were working on a project building out a social media application. We were hiring a marketing intern for the project and put out a job ad. We saw the same pattern where we would get 200 applicants for one internship position, almost all of whom had no work experience. My co-founder, Richard saw this as a problem and started thinking about the issue. Why was there such a high demand for work experience from students? That thought experiment turned into months of research into the education system and a realization that the system is fundamentally broken for millions of students. Post-secondary has become costly in time, money and was ineffective for many in launching their careers. With an understanding of the student’s and businesses motivations and problems, we started imagining what the future would look like if we designed an education system, from first principles. This led us down a path that would forever change our lives and the lives of thousands of students and business owners. We imagined a world where students would get trained by industry for industry, faster than traditional schooling and free. In our world education was free, accessible and leads to jobs. This sounded like a fantasy, and thinking back it was a really big ambition. At the time we had no real product-market fit in our social media app but had a lot of experience launching products together. We decided to drop the app to focus on building an education company. We knew it would take years to build anything remotely close to what we imagined so we created a multi-phase plan in achieving our mission. This was a mission that was personal to us, and was important enough to dedicate our lives too. We started with free courses, then moved on to apprenticeships and certifications. Now we are building out a suite of collaboration tools to enable businesses and students to collaborate together. We are at the base of a very big mountain, with a mission that will make a positive impact on the lives of millions. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. ‍",1,0
79," Before I started GoRails, I was working full-time consulting for startups and other small businesses. It was frustrating doing months of work to see it go to waste over and over again because our clients didn't implement it. I really, really wanted to build something that people used. This pushed me to burn out on consulting badly., so I had to figure out a way to make a successful product that motivated me. The idea came to me after purchasing GoRails.com to share my notes for Ruby on Rails development publicly. My website started getting a lot of traffic. Since I had traffic already, I figured I’d try to sell something to these visitors. In the past, I had always tried to build ideas without any way of marketing them. I am a developer, not a marketer, so I had always made products but never got any users. This time was different because I was selling to an audience I already had. Plus, they were people I love to talk with: other developers! ",1,0
80," Graphite was born during my MFA program in Creative Writing. I did not have a real technical background at this point. Sure, I’d worked for tech companies, but my roles have always been customer-facing. So, when I had the idea for Graphite, I didn’t know how to make it happen. But let’s back up. Why did I even want to build Graphite? I’ve always been a writer. My whole life has been filled with writing. It just wasn’t until I was in my 30s that I could afford to invest in a degree that clearly wasn’t going to have a job-related, financial return. But when I was financially secure enough to do it, I jumped at the chance to get my MFA.  As I got closer to the end of my MFA program, I realized my most important writing—short stories, novels, notes, etc—were being stored in Google. Google has not had a great history with privacy. They also have had issues where people would be locked out of their accounts either accidentally or for seemingly arbitrary reasons. I couldn’t bear the thought of one day losing all of my writing. And I was NOT going back to Microsoft Word.  I did some research, but I couldn’t find an alternative to Google Docs where I’d have complete control over my documents and couldn’t be locked out. So I said, fuck it. I’ll build it.  I taught myself to code with the singular focus on bringing this thing to life. I made life even harder by deciding to use cutting edge technology that would allow me to realize my requirements of censorship resistance and true user-ownership. There was a steep learning curve not only in learning to code but in diving deep into blockchain and cryptography. But I was motivated. And interestingly enough, the motivation was not around launching a business. It was about building this thing for me.  In fact, when I was ready to launch Graphite, I didn’t. I hosted it for myself only. But when some people I know in the blockchain space found out about it, they encouraged me to make it available to everyone. So, I did.  ‍",0,0
81," GrowSurf was born after waiting for years for someone else to build it. My co-founder Derek and I had worked on a few web projects together, and that’s when I would search for referral software we could use. But none of the solutions looked like the right fit for what we were thinking of as a plug-and-play platform. Over the years, I would revisit googling referral software (and also look on Quora, Product Hunt, etc). Nothing ever really looked ideal. That’s when Derek and I started building GrowSurf.  The original vision of GrowSurf was to build the best piece of seamless referral software that we could imagine. With our first version of the product, we ended up strayed far away from the original vision with a lot of technical compromises. It took some time to get back to our roots and rebuild the product, but now the business is doing much better with a renewed customer focus. ",1,0
82," I’ve been in the ‘Internet Marketing space’ since I was 15 years old when I first stumbled on the forum BlackHatWorld. I had always been a nerdy kid and immediately fell in the love with the idea of being able to get rich online building websites. Of course, it wasn’t that simple. I took me 3 months to even make my first dollar online. But after that point, I was hooked. Since then I’ve had a wide variety of Internet-based ‘side hustles’ you could call them. I had an affiliate blog for a while called StreetSumo, which helped people in the streetwear/sneaker space find cheap alternatives to popular trends, which drove over $85,000 in revenue to the Amazon Affiliate program. Last summer, I was working a marketing internship at a tech company that was doing very well. They were spending roughly $250,000/month in paid traffic (AdWords/Facebook) and were paying an agency 8% to manage it. It completely blew my mind that we were paying a company the equivalent of a $240,000 annual salary ($20,000/month * 12). So I started to look into digital agencies and their business models. I had previously tried to start a lead generation agency in my Spring semester of 2018, but failed, mostly due to my complete lack of sales skills. I was terrified of getting on the phone and speaking with clients and it reflected in my wavering tone. That business died in 2 months, after never getting a single client. ‍",1,0
83," After completing my IB exams in high school I decided to keep scratching that entrepreneurial itch by studying business at CASS Business School in London where I majored in finance. Honestly, University was a bit of a blur, but I do remember realizing early on that I wasn’t a fan of the big financial institutions. I could never reconcile fiat currencies and the total ridiculousness of wealth inequality. We can print money out of thin air and create trillions in bullshit derivatives, yet 2 billion people don’t have access to clean drinking water. Right… Never ended up using that Finance degree in a career kind of way, but those courses in stats were super useful when it came time to setting up statistically significant A/B tests a few years down the road.  After University I ended up heading growth at EuroVPS, a managed hosting provider, as their first marketing hire. With zero experience in digital marketing and a team that consisted of mostly engineers, I ended up having to fake it till I made it and learned everything by myself through trial and error. I made every noob mistake in the book. From forgetting to set 301 redirects after a site relaunch, to using broad match keywords in Adwords without a single negative keyword. I’ve screwed up more ways than most people would ever financially afford to screw up.   I spent countless hours reading blog posts and taking Udemy courses on new areas I wanted to improve in. While I learned a lot, I noticed my productivity was inversely correlated to how much stuff I learned. The more time I spent learning things, the less time I had to actually get things done. There had to be a better way to learn and stay competitively productive concurrently.  That’s when the idea hit me.  This was the breakthrough move I made that ultimately planted the seed for the birth of GrowthMentor.  Instead of watching courses made by some random person who knows nothing about my business, why don’t I hack together my own real life courses custom tailored to my point-in-time situation?  To do this I’d create job postings on Upwork such as: “60 minutes Skype call with Facebook Ads expert,” and do screen shares with freelance subject-matter expertise and learn directly from them in a field environment. I was shocked at how much faster I learned this way. I was breaking through plateaus left and right. If anything seemed difficult or out of reach to learn I’d simply create a job posting on Upwork and get on a call with an expert. I’d make sure to do my homework and due diligence before the call as to be prepared with structured questions. I’d even record my screen so I could play it back later. This way I could focus 100% without having to take notes.  This was how the idea originated. I figured, “I’m just a typical person who has typical problems,” so if this works for me, it’ll probably work for other people too! ‍",1,0
84," We were 19, 20, and 20 at the time. Since we were all in university, we had a lot of time on our hands. The idea was a classic example of scratching your own itch.  This was an SEC school, so there were about 30,000 students and a good proportion of them partied a lot. There were 10 major bars downtown and on any night of the week, you could find one that was packed. In order to enter the bar, you typically had to pay $5 to $10 in cash at the door, referred to as “the cover.” Usually, that was the bar’s profit, and there were drink specials sold at cost.  If you didn’t have cash, you’d have to go to an ATM - which meant getting hit with a withdrawal fee (plus the annoyance of losing your spot in line). After experiencing this pain ourselves and witnessing countless others, we figured people would appreciate a cashless alternative. ",0,0

The idea came about when I decided to build something to help my cousin, who owns a private gym, get more clients and manage memberships online. Since he was into the idea and wanted to try it out when it was built, I assumed (mistake #1!) other private gym owners would be on board as well. I reached out to a friend of mine from high school and we decided to work on Gymlisted together - I would take care of the programming and he would take care of outreach. ‍",0,0
86," I’m telling the story of my co-founder, Peter, who started Habitify.  ‍ Peter was an iOS developer who got promoted to project manager only 2 years after he had joined his first company. The salary at that time was attractive and generally higher than most of his peers.  But he was not satisfied. He has always had this dream of exploring life to the fullest, and improving people’s lives with his skills. The offered job might give him financial stability, but it wouldn’t be able to give him what he truly wanted.  So he quit. Spending the next few months at home doing nothing (actually trying to find inspiration for his new business) was quite a rough start. Peter was truly demotivated, now that his mom kept telling him to get out and find something to do (which Asian moms would typically do to their lazy children).  One day, she reached the peak of her anger and said: “You don’t know how to appreciate this life. While you’re slacking off here enjoying all these luxuries, thousands of children in Africa are dying!”  Eureka.  Peter got an idea. He wanted to make an app to help improve the world. That app, he thought initially, must donate a part of its income to children in Africa. And so he set out to do market research and found the niche he’s in right now. That’s how Habitify started - a habit tracker that donates $1 of every purchase to provide water for African children.  ‍",1,0
87," I started Habitual after reading Atomic Habits by James Clear, a book I can highly recommend to anyone interested in how habits function. This book outlined the psychology behind habits really well and made the path to creating a good one and breaking bad ones really clear to me. Being the programmer I am, the first thing I did was to see if there were any apps out there that could help me apply all these things I learned about in Atomic Habits. I did find a surprisingly big amount of habit trackers out there, but none of them were to my liking. They were either too techy, with lots of graphs, or too flimsy, with big buttons and nice illustrations, but not much overview of how you were doing. I kind of felt like Goldilocks with all these apps, since none of them felt right and I knew that I’d end up not using a non-essential app like this unless it felt right. Thinking back, it was the good old story of a developer scratching his own itch. And I guess it didn’t hurt that I wanted to get into programming in React native. ‍",0,0
88," In late 2015 I was freelancing and looking for a startup problem to tackle. Spurred on in part by the hype at the time around drones and their applications, we began searching for use cases. We started by cold calling people asking them about how they used their drones. At one point, we got feedback that vineyard owners and farmers would be worth chatting to, so we started to focus on these niches. It became clear quite quickly that there were a number of areas farmers thought drones could be useful to them: Rounding up stockMeasuring grass levels, a.k.a dry matterSurveying land We discarded rounding up stock and surveying land, as they were already being worked on if not already available. From what we could tell, no one had found an accurate way of measuring dry matter from a drone camera. For context - dairy farmers in New Zealand (and other countries) grow grass for the cows to eat. They have a number of paddocks they rotate the stock through. It’s important to know the dry matter available on each paddock so they can budget the amount of feed available for their stock. E.g. if they predict a deficit in their feed budget, they can order supplementary feed ahead of time or apply extra fertilizer to the lagging paddocks. My background is in primarily in software and mathematics. Although I hadn’t done any machine learning since university 6 years earlier, after speaking with some local experts in the field they suggested this was a problem well within the possibility of solving. ‍",0,0
89," I was a tech enthusiast, that's why I studied and worked in the field of Information Technology. I have been working for around 6 years back then and proved myself capable of managing my own time. When there aren't technical problems at work, you don't have users to support, and that free time was spent online. I was into sports motorcycles as well, which was more like a hobby. I owned a 2008 Honda CBR1000rr and I enjoyed posting pictures and videos of riding. Eventually, I created an Instagram account specifically to post motorcycle related content. I had a daily theme, for example, Fast Friday: on Friday I would post a 0-100 km/hour acceleration video. However, I faced a problem back then when I tried to find interesting media to post. When you search for #acceleration on Instagram, most results were related to cars not motorcycles, and I had to scroll through pages of results to find what I was looking for. I needed something that allowed me to find content easily. But, as I didn't find it, I decided to create one. ‍",0,0
90," I have long been a believer in contributing to the greater good. I knew after I graduated from Suffolk University with a bachelor’s degree in business administration and economics that I wanted to support projects that would benefit my country. I worked for a bank, an Internet company, and an oil company before co-founding an energy company that brought thermonuclear power to my country’s citizens. Before becoming the leader of Hawkers, I oversaw investments in several business sectors that helped companies achieve their financial goals while providing employment opportunities for citizens. Since I led Hawkers’ first funding round as an angel investor, the founders saw that I could help them with brand expansion, building strategic business relationships, and creating more fundraising opportunities.

91," Oh boy! I remember this day like yesterday. At the time when I started my company, I had just come off the campaign trail of working for a slew of campaigns including Obama for America, Repower America, and Greenpeace.  Hawthorne Strategies LLC was purely formed because at the time, I was working with KSTB Enterprises --a nonprofit development resource agency-- and had received a client who needed more than what the agency was able to offer, which was a national PR campaign. I remember the CEO, Kim Sellars-Bates, coming to me and asking if I ever considered starting my own business. I had no intention of doing so. I remember the immediate fears of failure since I never owned my own business. But Kimberly inspired and believed in me so much that she risked losing me as an employee to see me fly. To this day, I’m ever grateful because she was the very reason that helped me connect with and discover the entrepreneur inside of me that I had no clue existed. Needless to say, that was the beginning of Hawthorn Strategies. I took on my first client and shortly afterward, I was off to my first Super Bowl to debut my client’s campaign. ‍",0,0
92," My story begins in 2015, when I started my first side project, a design gallery highlighting the coolest landing page designs on the internet (I was 21 at the time). When I was working as a freelance Conversion Optimization Specialist, I couldn't come up with solid ideas for landing pages for clients. As a result, I decided to start my side project, called Landingfolio, solving this personal challenge. Make something you'd like to use yourself. Even if no one buys it, it's still worth something to you. Furthermore, you are the most knowledgeable customer and know exactly what you want. Landingfolio expanded rapidly to become one of the most popular landing page inspiration websites, with over 1000 visitors each day. Inspiration websites are extremely difficult to monetize because designers typically visit for inspiration and then leave. I've been running the website for four years without making any money from it, focusing instead on client work. A year ago, I began my journey as a digital nomad, traveling around the world and meeting plenty of talented individuals who have built great online SaaS companies. These folks motivated me greatly, and I realized how successful a startup could be if I only knew how to code. As a result, I had to make a difficult decision. Reduce my client work to two days per week and devote the remaining four days (plus one day off) to learning to code. As a result, I embarked on an eight-month full-time trip to learn to program. I leveraged everything I learned from Landingfolio to create Inspireframe, which was launched in June 2020. In this launch, I tried a lot of different techniques, documented them all for later use, and then used them all in my most recent and successful product launch.",1,0
93," Before Headway, my partners and I worked with other startups as Co-Founders, Partners, and consulting with startups.   Headway came out of a passion and desire to create new things and new ways of doing things. It was also born out of just a gap we saw in the market of how companies were showing up to serve startups. We started as a way to partner and own problems alongside other founders.   Working with passionate founders who have an idea, a vision, and a future impact they want to make is so energizing.  When we were raising for our previous startups, we needed folks to join us to help us go faster because our vision outpaced our velocity. In that process, we only found vendors and not trustworthy partners. They would ask questions about specific requirements, hardening scope, fixed procedures.  But that’s not how startups work. There are so many unknowns, so many surprises, and so much uncertainty.   What we wanted was a partner to take ownership alongside us and help us learn and adjust with the market, figure out how to gain best and serve customers, and care about it as much as we did. I went to college for Business Administration and MIS and was a self-taught designer, mostly from experience doing projects out of passion or friends.   Since high school, we were always creating new things - not for profit, but for fun. We started snowboarding clubs, t-shirt companies, we sold lip-synced mixtape videos long before YouTube existed. Along the path, as we were designing and creating, we evolved from doing websites and e-commerces to full-fledged applications.   Eric, Partner & COO at Headway, is also my brother. In the earlier days of our journey, we started our agency called VERBS, and within that agency, we did all things for all people. With that approach, we had enough work to keep us busy and had the typical freelancer mentality.   When we started Headway, we knew that to grow beyond ourselves we had to find a more targetable niche to attract clients more predictably, know where to find them, and find people who could join us on the journey.   Throughout our startup journey before Headway, we were part of so many different efforts—some that failed miserably, some that were sold, some that are still in the market today. In the worst-case scenario, we built the product in isolation for a year and a half and didn’t talk to a single potential customer.  To our surprise, it failed without any traction at all. We tried to save it by pivoting with the market, but we were out of resources, and more importantly - our energy and enthusiasm for it.  We ended up creating something that no one truly wanted. This was all before Lean Startup, but we started moving into our next startups by creating prototypes, validating with our customers, and having honest conversations around their problems.  That’s where we started shifting from building products to building prototypes and using them to sell into both B2C and B2B opportunities. We wanted to bring this validated and continuous learning to the struggling startups so they could start making traction and get real-world business progress.",1,0
94," I had gone to the United States for my bachelor’s degree in economics. After graduating, I came back to Europe and Belgium to start my M.B.A. As we launched Hello Tyro during my studies and saw its potential and growth, I decided to drop out of school to fully focus on the company and give ourselves the best chance to succeed. Even if it ultimately failed, it is not a decision I regret one bit. So many learnings came out of this experience which I would have not gotten following the M.B.A. The idea came as a new status was created for students in Belgium “Student entrepreneurs” which gave them more opportunities to work and make money from jobs. We had the conviction that some talented students could take on more challenging jobs in startups to develop new skills that could be very helpful for their future careers. It was my very first entrepreneurial endeavor so I had no frame of reference when it came to launch and build this company from the ground up.",0,0
95," When I started my current company SaaS Labs, the thesis of the business was (& still remains) that we are big-time bullish on 3 major themes:  Cloud Adoption: More & more businesses around the world will adopt cloud for running their business operationsRemote work: A good chunk of the workforce will work remotely. Not necessarily work from home but away from HQ or the work desk for sure.  Automation: Every business will adopt some kind of automation to improve profitability and compete well with other businesses.  In late 2017, as the JustCall (a cloud phone system https://justcall.io) team started to grow, we felt a need for shared inbox software to handle our help@, sales@, etc email addresses. For the next 12-15 months, we tried all the available products in the market. But, all these products were either too expensive or too complex. So, we decided to build our own shared inbox for our own team, for our own use only. Our managers helped us build analytics on top of it to track KPIs.  During a team offsite, when we were planning our annual revenue growth and goals, someone suggested launching our in-house team email software as a product in the market. This product satisfies all the points which are part of our thesis so we decided to go ahead and launch this as Helpwise. Basically, this product came out of our own necessity. On 2nd Dec 2019, we launched Helpwise on Product Hunt & got featured. The current product is 5-10x better & powerful than the first version. ",1,0
96," Before building Henry, I founded a FinTech startup called Nubi, which is a cross-border payment system that integrates with PayPal and TransferWise. While in Nubi, I found it really difficult to hire developers, basically because there is a lack of talent in the market. A lot of people are still more attracted by the typical careers of the 20th century (law, journalism, etc.), rather than computer science. Henry surged as an attempt to solve this problem of the market. The first solution I came up with consisted of a company that gave people loans so that they could afford studing engineering. We gave 26 loans, but the company soon failed, mainly because of three things: Argentina’s high inflation rates were incompatible with providing loans with a friendly interest rate for students.It was difficult to scale.It was very capital intensive. So I did a pivot and decided to build the Lambda School for Latin America. Lambda School is a famous school in the US that trains software developers for free and helps them find a job in exchange for a share of their future income. Henry has the same model. Once the students get into our program, they learn web development, and once they get a job, they start paying 15% of their income until they reach a max cap of $4,000. We are super proactive with getting the students a job because we basically don't make money if they don't get one. Our incentives are aligned with the student. More than 90% of students that got a job are because we’ve introduced them to the company.",1,0

I was working as a field agent too for a market research company to pay my bills until I was able to secure a better job Hubrif was built to be a better alternative to other video platforms for watching African short films.

101," What's your background? What part of your background defines you, and possibly led to starting Hubstaff? I grew up always thinking that the best route was the one with no risk (completely the opposite of what I believe now) so after graduating college with a degree in finance I accepted a corporate finance job in Chicago thinking this was just the next move to make. This is where the road to Hubstaff begins. After 18 months of being cramped in a small cubicle and commuting two hours to and from work every day, I realized this was not the path for me. I quit my job and built my first online business where I sold instructional golf material. I loved what I was doing and was finding great success in it, so much so that I thought it would be a good idea to scale the business and rent an office - it seemed like the next logical step. I realized shortly after being back in an office that this was in fact not the right move for me and all those feelings I felt in a corporate office came rushing back. The freedom I once enjoyed from my online business was dwindling as the responsibilities of managing an office and employees became more prevalent. Eventually, the stress and lack of freedom were too much and I decided to sell the business in 2009, it was a good run but I was ready to move on to something new. After I sold the golf business I was given the opportunity to buy into an SEO company. I was excited about this new opportunity since I’ve always had an interest in software but never had the experience. One of the things that really attracted me to this opportunity was that it was remote, my office could be anywhere I wanted it to be. I learned a lot during this time but one of the most important things - and ultimately the thing that lead me to where I am today, was how to manage a remote team. I learned that a good project management software was key to running a productive and successful team. I left the SEO business after a few years and decided I was ready to create something of my own, it was at this time I truly realized the benefits of a good time tracking software. I saw how important this kind of software was to me and believed that others most likely have this same need and that’s how Hubstaff was born. ‍ Before Hubstaff, what were you doing? Working, school, traveling? What were you focused on professionally? This question goes hand-in-hand with the previous one. Before Hubstaff I started a few online businesses (e-commerce and software) and ran them for about 9 years before starting Hubstaff. The other businesses were successful but Hubstaff has become the largest venture to date. ‍ If you had any failed and/or previous ideas or businesses, it is great to talk about them and how they molded your decisions. My first online business was a golf business where I created and sold training material such as DVDs and books. At first, I was the only person in this specific niche but eventually, the competition began to arise. My brand was not strong enough to keep competition out and although competition means you have a good idea, my brand wasn’t at the level where it could maintain the monopoly. On top of growing competition, the advertising market was also changing at a rapid pace and prices for ad space was continuing to rise. As difficult as it can be to see a business fail, this particular experience taught me so much and I was able to take what I learned, especially about myself, and carry that with me in future business decisions. ‍ Did any big life events lead to starting Hubstaff? There wasn’t a specific life event that lead me to start Hubstaff, in fact, it was quite the opposite. It was a series of events, trial, and error if you will, that lead me to where I am today. ‍ How did the idea come to you? The idea of Hubstaff was born out of my own personal pain points from managing a remote team. I came to realize that a good project management software was crucial to a successful remote business and when I was still with the SEO company we tried out several but never found anything that had all the features we were looking for. I started thinking up ways of how a SaaS could help manage remote teams, I decided to focus on time tracking with management aspects. I wanted the software to integrate with different project management and payroll systems so that eventually it would become the hub for your remote staff - and that’s how the name Hubstaff came to be. ‍ How has the original idea grown and changed over time? The original idea of Hubstaff was to provide managers with the ability to understand what their team is working on without the constant need for follow up. Over time we’ve continued to work on growing our software and making it the best it can possibly be. We’ve also listened to what our customers have to say since their feedback is the most important. Now, Hubstaff has grown into a general time tracking application that helps companies of all shapes and sizes streamline their business processes.   What were your motivations to build Hubstaff? I knew that I wasn’t the only person trying to figure out the best and most efficient way to manage their remote team. I felt there was a lot of value that Hubstaff could provide to other business owners that were building remote teams and I understood their problems deeply. I knew that this was a product that they would get a lot of value from on a daily basis. ‍",1,0
102," My background is creative, as I studied painting at the University of Wales and at L’ecole de Nantes, France. I realized earlier on in my 20’s that having a degree in fine art wasn’t useful and I was supplementing my income by working on the checkout of a local supermarket and buying and selling Nintendo 64’s on eBay. Around the year 1999, the web was reaching its peak and I learned web design fairly quickly. I got a job working on ThisIsBristol, a local news portal connected with the Daily Mail group. I worked there for 3 months, learning as much as I could before moving over to a UK based Government agency, working there for 2 years as the head of web design and development. Speaking to the bosses, we both agreed that I should leave the company. The role was very well paid and I had the responsibility of traveling to London frequently to speak with top Government staff to working on the £4.5m Planning Portal. I had itchy feet and felt I could do a lot more if I worked for myself. I decided to move to Hong Kong to live with my partner, where I did a lot of freelance work and also made good money from buying and selling websites and domains. Freelancing was tough, so I made my own websites making money from sponsorships, Ask (Jeeves) and Google Adsense. As Hong Kong is predominantly full of millionaires, I built up my social network and started to create custom paintings and get represented by galleries. At this stage, I didn’t get many failures in the web work I was doing and ended up moving to China in 2006. In the years from 2004-2008, it seemed people had a lot more disposable income. I remember selling the Mobiles.org.nz domain name for close to $3000! Now the value of this domain would be around $50. My biggest life event at this point is that I became a full-time father and stopped working for about 4 years, relying on income from my websites. Later as my son was in full-time education, I was able to restart my work and get rid of the sites that didn’t generate much income because Google changed their Adsense terms. In 2015 I created Gifts and Coupons which listed all the latest, cool gifts you can buy. It was the type of site I wanted to visit, as I found it hard to find great presents. I started to get messages from people with crowdfunding campaigns who wanted to be on the site, but as they weren’t things you could physically buy I turned them away. The requests became so frequent that I looked into crowdfunding and Kickstarter, which is the biggest rewards-based platform. I saw that only 30% of all crowdfunding campaigns were successful and reached their goal! I thought I could help and built Hyperstarter, which focuses on the campaign page first for free and then offers additional paid services from promotion on the site to “hands-on” work. ‍",1,0
103," It all started back in 2011. I had finished my Master's degree in Australia and came back to the US. But, I didn't have a job as the Great Recession of 2008 had just ended, and the economy was still in bad shape.  My business partner and CEO of Imaginovation, Pete Peranzo was working at SAS, at that time, but he wanted to do something bigger, and build something of his own. Pete and I met through one of our mutual friends years before, but little did we know that we would become such great friends and then 50/50 business partners.   Pete knew that there's a hidden entrepreneur inside me. One day, very randomly though, Pete called me and asked if I want to start a company. ""Wait. What?"" I was both excited, confused and very anxious to know his idea.  I always had this dream of starting my own business, and put my marketing and creative skills to work. So I was more than excited to implement Pete’s idea, but there was a hitch. None of us knew how to build a business.  Pete and I were determined to start a technology company helping other businesses with their websites and applications. Some of Pete's friends, who were software developers and web developers, and also jobless at that time, were happy to join us. They were ready to work for free for a few months until we were able to close some business.  We came together and decided to set up a full-service web and mobile app development company to help businesses achieve their true potential through innovative technology as well as solve their internal pain points.  We started mulling over the company name, and I thought a great slogan for our company would be ""Imagination turns innovation,"" and the name ""Imaginovation"" quickly popped in our mind. In fact, it was a dream I had the night before, so it felt like fate, to be honest.  This is how Imaginovation came to existence.  ",1,0
104," I started IMPOSSIBLE originally as a blog to be an impetus to do something interesting with my life. I was sitting at home, living in my parents’ basement - watching a ton of Netflix and wishing I could do something in my life worth writing about. I had done everything you were supposed to do - but graduating in the middle of the 2009 recession meant I was doing temp jobs at UPS and wondering “is this it?” Was it all worth it?  Everything seemed impossible for me so I turned to the internet. I saw people like Sean Ogle quit their job, move to Thailand and start side quests like going to the top 100 bars in the world. Chris Guillebeau was traveling to every country in the world. I wanted the freedom to do any of that, but it all seemed unrealistic for someone like me. I made a list - but it all seemed so preposterously impossible that I called it an impossible list. That said, after one time of going through it and realizing that there was one thing on the list I didn’t have an excuse for - running a triathlon. I didn’t know anything about triathlons, but I signed up, trained for it, and did it. I realized at the end of it - that I spent so much time telling myself I couldn’t do stuff and I just did one of them! What else could I do if I just went for it? I decided to take on harder challenges - longer races, better jobs, and eventually starting my own business - all while writing about it.  The writing kept me accountable and then I realized that people were not just interested in the stories, but they wanted to do it themselves. That let me start sharing my experiences, showing how I went about something, and then turning it into different products (which then let me do more things). ",1,0
105," My background is in software engineering. While in college I got a job, I had no business getting. I was one of the first 6 hires at an iOS development shop. I knew almost nothing about iOS development when I started (I didn’t even own a smartphone yet), but I was willing to work for cheap so the founders took a flyer on me. I learned fast and managed to stick around. We were constantly building and launching new products (6 apps in the first two months I was there, and I worked on 5 of them) so I learned a ton. But I immediately knew I wanted to try to build something on my own. Around the same time, some people I knew were starting an accelerator program. They knew my friends and I were trying to start something of our own and had the technical chops to build a product. Because we were in Columbia, SC (where we were living and grew up) their other teams were mostly non-technical founders. So, they gave us a check for $16,000, access to some incredible mentors, and basically told us we could work on whatever we wanted to. When we first started the program we actually wanted to build a Dribbble competitor. I was trying to learn design at the time and was frustrated by how hard it was to find people to give me feedback. But our mentors running the accelerator program encouraged us to start doing user interviews and pushed us to figure out our business model, and we quickly realized there wasn’t much of a business there. In our conversations with designers, the biggest problem we heard basically boiled down to, “working with clients is hard.” So, we decided to try to build software to make working with clients easier. The first product ultimately became Ink. ‍",0,0
106," As a student manager, I noticed how much time and effort it took to be a student athlete. Most began their days at 6 a.m. working out and going to rehab if they were injured. They’d then rush to class, scarf down lunch, go back to practice, maybe some more class, and then get home when it was already dark out to do their homework. I felt awful for these athletes, as their commitment to their sport took up most if not all of their time to develop professional skills. Additionally and most notably, at the time, the NCAA did not allow college athletes to profit off of their name, image, and likeness (NIL) in any capacity (including starting their own business), which meant most athletes were left with little to zero experience when they graduated. However, an opportunity arose. California announced that by 2024, college athletes in California would be able to profit off of their NIL, combating the NCAA’s amateurism policy. I knew that other states would soon follow, and I sat down and thought to myself, “How could I help college athletes capitalize off of this opportunity with a solution that can scale to all college athletes?” Inked Sports became that solution. Over time, certain parts of Inked Sports changed as my co-founder, Max, and I continued to meet with professors and other business professionals to get their feedback on the idea. But the core concept of helping college athletes for free never changed. We then dove into extensive customer discovery with both athletes and brands to ensure that our product would be designed specifically for the needs of both customer bases. My motivation to build Inked Sports is to help athletes who feel underrepresented feel represented. 98% of college athletes don’t make it to the professional level, leaving 490,000 athletes with little to no interest from agencies that can help them. We built a solution that enables any college athlete to essentially be their agent and manage their NIL opportunities in less than 15 min a day.",1,0
107," I started writing code back in my teens because I was always fascinated by it. The idea of starting a software company started somewhere in those days itself even though the details were fuzzy back then. After my studies in Computer Science, I took up a job in a software company. I did not want to jump right into starting a venture before gaining exposure to the industry. While I worked at an organization for 2 years, I started developing web applications part-time for known people along with a classmate from engineering. That’s when we started crafting a plan to venture out on our own. Somewhere during that adventure, InoVVorX was born. A word of advice here. If you’re thinking of a name for your company, please pick something that is simple to pronounce and straightforward to spell. No one gives a rat’s ass about the name of your company except you. We opted for a fancy name. Every time I met a potential client, I would mention, “I am from Inno-Works, I-N-O-V-V-O-R-X.” Even after that effort, people would still get the spelling wrong. Anyway, we started InoVVorX as a service-based company, with a vision of building a web-based product. Back in 2010, raising investment at an early stage of a startup in India was an uphill task. Founders had to bootstrap and build the business to a certain extent before investors would consider putting in a small sum of money into your venture. Once you achieved reasonable sales and growth, the Series B funding had a lot of opportunities though. Today, that situation has changed drastically. Both of us co-founders come from a humble background and we did not have a lot of cash in hand to run the expenses until a growth stage. The initial capital we pooled in came from the little savings we gathered from our 2-year job stint. We knew that our only option was to find a way to generate revenue early. Since I had a strong background in programming and every business those days was looking for a website, we spotted an opportunity to fuel our business. We hired programmers at a reasonable cost and it worked. We used the money to hire other team members required for sales, designing, admin work, and programming. As we gained clients, I focused all my effort on building products with a couple of team members while the others handled the service-based business. Our plan was right on track. ‍",0,0
108," I have always been interested in computers – I’ve been programming in one form or another since primary school. I’ve always loved the creativity and the speed. You can start out with absolutely nothing and have something worth showing in just a few hours or days. This was true back when I started in the 80s and even more so now. ‍ What were your motivations to build IWantThatFlight? I first came up with the idea in 2001. Back then, there wasn't an easy way to compare flights (this was before kayak, skyscanner, etc) so I wrote a simple script to compare the 3 airlines that serviced the Australian domestic routes I was interested in. I was working full time for a rail infrastructure company (so interesting!) and just did this in my evenings. Then out of nowhere Sudoku came along and I had the good fortune to purchase sudoku.com.au. Sudoku was huge worldwide, and my site quickly rose to 50,000 visits a day. I quit my job, and went all in on Sudoku (not a something you hear every day). I coded up community features around the puzzles and at its height, it was hosting real-life parties all around the world. All good things come to an end, however, and after 2 years Sudoku cooled and traffic dropped off. I didn't want to go back to working for other companies and so hunted around for something else to do. After a few false starts, I dusted off IWantThatFlight.com.au and have been plugging away ever since. ‍ Have you had any failed business? The biggest dud I have had (out of several) is blogfight.com. This site allowed you put a widget on your blog (this was back in 2007 when blogs and widgets were huge) and it would match you up in a ""fight"" with another blog - that would be decided by traffic over a certain duration (e.g. a couple of days, a week etc., whatever you & the other blog owner decided). So, you and the other blog owner had a reason to trash talk each other, poke fun, rally your subscribers etc. and generally inject a bit of rivalry into the blog scene (and generate some extra traffic). I based the idea on a few contests I had seen between other blogs around that time. I spent weeks coding it all up. Making sure the widgets could handle the traffic. Making sure traffic fraud was accounted for. Everything. But not a moment spent on how it would make money, or even how to get the blog owners interested in taking part. I wasn't part of the blogging community so I didn't even have a peer group who would use it just because they knew me.  In the end, I canned it before even launching it properly, which was the right decision. Not knowing how the business was going to make money was just plain stupid, but the biggest lesson I learned was that I have to have a marketing channel which I know will work before starting on a project. The channel might be your email list, Twitter followers, Facebook or even the Buy-Sell-Trade section of a niche forum - just make sure you have something you know works.",1,0
109," The Job market is an evergreen market. Our city was declared as a SEZ Industrial area by the government which led to around 300+ industries setting their industrial units in the city. We saw this as a huge opportunity to get into the job market. We already had a business directory for the city so starting a job portal seemed rational. The gap we noticed in between job seekers and industries looking for candidates was the lack of awareness about the jobs posted by companies. The famous job portals in bigger cities were yet not popular in our city because of the lack of internet reach. Jobs posted in newspapers only got covered for a day. So, we were motivated by the objective of bridging this gap with a model in which jobs were posted by us on our job portal and the paying job seekers got notifications about the job posting via SMS on their mobile phones. Moreover, by that time, we were looking for more revenue streams for our online business directory. Our business directory was already famous with local business owners. However, we struggled to get any paid memberships from industries. Creating Jobridge seemed like a logical step to move ahead.",0,0
110," I have a B.S. in finance and have worked in two small investment banks in New York City for about six years. I used to love that job but I decided that I wanted to make stuff instead of watching other people make stuff. This was the beginning of me launching my “entrepreneurial” path. I had an idea for gathering personal stories through online collaboration. While building my first company I also decided to get a MBA and meet some folks who might want to join my venture. During school, I was able to build a beta website and beta mobile app, but that was the easy part. I used a lot of my savings and some family helped me too. I went to trade shows and talked with investors. However, after 2.5 years of hard work I could never get off the ground or find the right partner to join me. Ultimately, I had to stop trying. Looking back on my first venture, the problem was very clear, but I wasn’t able to solve it. I think the rule of thumb is making a product 10x better than current solution and my product was like 2x-3x better. I had some traction but not enough growth. And that’s why Joker Greeting took me by surprise and showed me what a startup really looks like a solid idea grows organically and virally. Joker Greeting started as a funny project between my brother and me. We saw a musical doll at my mom’s house and we thought that it would be funny if we made the doll sang a non-stop song. We pitched our dad because he is funny and he told us to make a greeting card instead. He was absolutely right. There was no business plan. There was no market research. This wasn’t even supposed to be a business, it was simply a way to make $2,000, have fun and buy a PS4. Then I would move on. Instead, we raised $92,073.",1,0
111," After a long day of trying to get a ghost restaurant off the ground, my brain made the connection to something that might have untapped market potentials: Asian bitter melons. I tried a plain bitter melon drink and choked. It’s named “bitter melons” because they’re so darn bitter. It’s one of those foods that scientifically proven to lower blood sugar and a host of other health benefits. A quick maths in my head revealed that tens of thousands of diabetics and those at-risk would need daily doses of magic lower blood sugar juice. If only someone would be able to make a bitter melon juice that went from choke to death to barely drinkable, it will sell like crazy. I went all-in without validating the idea. ‍",0,0
112," When I was in the seventh grade I had a job after school working for a family friend who had his own business. It wasn’t anything fancy, but I got to see from an early age the freedom that an individual had to turn an idea into something profitable, and it was all his or hers. This was unheard of when I was growing up in the Soviet Union, so the concept of capitalism and entrepreneurship got into my brain and left me interested. When I was in high school I started working after school at a CAD software company where my uncle was an engineer. I did QA testing and this experience led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science in college. Out of school, I was hired as a software engineer, coding flight plan simulations for training military jet pilots. The work was cool but I grew out of the day to day monotony and the old-school corporate tech culture in a few short years. Plus, completing twenty pages of government paperwork for every page of coding killed my momentum. I started paying attention to the buzz coming from Silicon Valley, the rising stars of tech startups, and the all-in data-driven marketing efforts. I wanted to be a part of it all, to experiment with moving the needle and watch a small startup grow from the inside. I ended up in business school in California, not quite in the Bay Area, but close enough, in Monterey. With the goal of meeting the right marketer or founder who would be willing to take me under his wing, I knew that making new connections at school and through the strong alumni network would increase my chances of landing a gig where I could roll up my sleeves and learn at break-neck speed. I did just that, I was introduced to Mrinal Desai through the Dean within the first few weeks of school. Mrinal was an early LinkedIn employee, he had recently left the company and was currently doing the marketing for a remote helpdesk tool called Crossloop. He proved to be a phenomenal marketer and eager to introduce me to what he was working on for the purpose of getting some of the more tedious tasks off his plate.  From there I worked for a design firm, ZURB, where I really got a chance to apply everything I learned from Mrinal and run a lot of fun marketing campaigns - including an amazing speakers series - where I could zero in on the stories of founders, investors, and designers. I was having a blast living in California but my wife and I also started planning ahead and wanted to move back east to have a family. Before we did that though, we took a good amount of time off, traveled the world, figured out what we wanted to work on next and then moved to Boston. I started Criminally Prolific, a marketing consultancy that focuses largely on SEO, PR, and content related advising. Two years later, JustReachOut launched to support the work I was doing for clients, with an aim to make it useful for any marketers to dive into a PR campaign without too much effort or breaking the bank. I created JustReachOut and enlisted a few friends along the way for technical support, got my wife to join once I was at a phase where we had prospects and customers who were looking for something more robust than my PR hacks and she began to do the work of tying it altogether more cohesively and creating a framework for all the tactical stuff.  I’ve dabbled in building a few apps and of course got my start in tech as an engineer, but JustReachOut has been my very first product. When I started prototyping things, I really focused on what other marketers would find useful. I was involved in the founder community in Boston and I was constantly unofficially surveying the pain points marketers had with the PR process. So I convinced people to subscribe to the software before it was available. I would get feedback from my initial customers, incorporate it into my mockups, talk with more people and built it from there.  I built a basic version of the platform. But before I built it, I got buy-in from other marketers at meetups in Boston, where I was living at the time. I even got people to pay for the tool ahead of the launch. I would sketch ideas of how I was thinking it would look on a piece of paper and ask other people in marketing for feedback until I started getting responses that amounted to yeah, I'd pay for that. Getting constant feedback from someone, incorporating it into my sketches and showing it to them, again and again, is how I won my first customers. ",1,0
113," The idea for Kamua came from a need to provide people with the ability to auto convert their widescreen YouTube style videos to vertical mobile formats for apps.  First, we built a Netflix-for-short-film at Findie. Then, using AI we built, we automated the creation of short 10-15s trailers and we made hundreds of thousands of those for clients like L’Oréal, Nissan and Red Bull.  ‍ When it became obvious that these videos would also need to be converted into vertical versions, we built additional AI that identifies the focal point in each segment of a video and automatically crops the video to fit the desired size, like vertical or square. Then, we created Kamua as a brand that would help us distinguish from Findie. In the Hawaiian language, Kamua means “the first.” In Swahili it means to squeeze, compress or crush, which is kind of cool because we have tech that does all that. We just stumbled on the name and it worked out quite well. Our mascot is a chameleon (we call it “The Kamuleon” lol) which we really loved because it’s an animal that adapts to survive and we help people adapt their videos so they look like they were always intended for whatever screen they are on.  I came up with Findie, our original project, while I was doing my MBA. At the time it was obvious to me that there was no way of discovering the best curated short films out there. People were watching more and more videos online and on mobile and it just seemed logical to me that there was going to be a demand for great stories told by people outside of Hollywood who just didn’t have access to that kind of distribution. We got several thousand users but we quickly pivoted to a revenue generating B2B model. So that particular project is kind of a success but also in a way it failed to meet its original goals. The simple reason is that you have to focus on one thing at a time, and as soon as we launched Findie, we got a bunch of requests from really great brands who wanted to have their own branded version of the site with their own content. So we quickly got pulled into building a white label version and we made a fair amount of money with that, and it led us to build Kamua because of the need to automate video thumbnails. Maybe one day Findie will blow up if some celebrity loves it or we spin it out. I know you like to highlight failure and the role that it plays on shaping future decision making! What we did was fail in lots of small ways. We failed to understand how to build a user experience that instantly hooked people. Some people were like, well this isn’t the best video I’ve ever seen so I’m not coming back. Others wanted to watch series and not just one-off short films, so we failed at matching up brands with content with UX with user acquisition with monetization with retention. Way, way too many things to get right. You don’t start learning to juggle by juggling five samurai swords standing on a log in the middle of an alligator swamp. It would be a lot better to start with two tennis balls in the middle of your garden. What we learned from this is: singular focus. We focus 100% on Kamua and making it the best and fastest video repurposing tool on the planet. “Will it make our customers happier and keep them coming back?” is the question we ask when we are faced with a decision. I learned this from Steve Redgrave and his gold-medal winning Olympic rowing team. “Will it make the boat go faster?” That’s how they did it. ‍",1,0
114," In 2011 I went to Korea to study Go while secluded in the mountains. That was my last chance to become the first Go professional player in South America. At one point the opportunity was offered to me, a dream I had had for a decade. But I thought that I would be so far off-the-top of the game that it wouldn’t be my best contribution to the game and the community. I wanted to use my software skills to build something for everyone, not only for myself to compete. At one point I was building an online Go school and had dozens of recurring paying users, but I ran into a huge roadblock: It was very hard to extend services officially to the biggest Go server in the West. This happened because the live servers of the time had been built a decade before and had a very limited vision of what could be done: they didn’t see themselves as a platform for the expansion of Go activities as much as a technical feat of being able to play the game online. Kaya.gs was a very unique project for many reasons, but what got people really excited was the vision: the idea that something new and exciting would happen and that the community would be able to thrive with new community-oriented features. We had huge participation from the users in what had to be built, and even extended an Open Source part of the project for other developers to build AI’s, time systems and tournament systems. Back then I had had only about 1 year of web software engineering experience which will be an important piece of information later on. I had worked with startups and loved the ethos of building something for people that wanted it. ‍",0,0
115," Before I started Kimp I was a bit of a serial entrepreneur, launching and running a few different design startups. I started as a one-man operation, designing web banners back in 2003. Those were the early days of digital marketing and I was able to find clients on marketing forums. There was a shortage of designers for web banners, and that was fortunate for me in a couple of ways. I was a horrible designer at first. But I loved it and I was looking for work. To make it easier to land a job I set up an eCommerce site called BannersMall.com. And pretty soon one job led to another, and I had way more work than I could handle. Including brands like HostGator, Endurance International Group, and Russell Brunson. Between 2003-2007 I partnered with an LA-based designer named Chris Hevoyan. After a few great years, Chris moved on to other projects and I partnered with my brother, Ven who is also a Co-Founder of Kimp. Ven and I worked together to grow BannersMall and then launch Doto (a design agency so that we could take on the more complex projects that our clients kept bringing our way.) For a few years, we continued focusing on web banners for digital marketers through BannersMall. And we did this alongside more extensive design projects, motion graphics, and website design and development for other clients. We were doing great, business was booming and we were able to hire quite a few designers as well. But then about 3 years ago a steady decline started. On the BannersMall side of business, competitors had not only sprung up, but they’d innovated too. Meanwhile, we’d kept just things going steady. So our customers started increasingly opting for other services. On the Doto side of the business, we had that fatal flaw that a lot of agencies struggle with. Our bottom line was much too dependent on the big accounts of a few clients. When 2017 rolled around most of our work was with clients in the real estate and property development industries. Recognizing this we’d started building out some proprietary software for them, and positioning ourselves to secure more clients as a real estate/development marketing and design specialists. But with the market’s fluctuations, our client’s marketing and design budgets also took a big dip. And at what felt like breakneck speed we had to pivot. We had an awesome group of designers depending on us. And even with all of the upheaval we were experiencing, we knew there were a lot of other industries that would continue to need design services on an ongoing basis. So as we started bleeding money we went through different business models and landed back on subscription-based graphic design. We’d thought about tackling it in 2015. But at the time we were already spreading ourselves pretty thin. Now with everything on the line we dove in. I’d initially learned about unlimited graphic design when I found out about Design Pickle. The company had turned design into a productized service with huge success. And we believed we could put our twist on it. Enter, Kimp. ‍",1,0
116," KnowNet was born from our experiences as tutors. Ari and I both tutored extensively - he primarily served the ESL (English as a Second Language) community both as a tutor and university/public school classroom instructor, and I tutored high school and college students in Math and Sciences, in addition to my day job at the time as a multiple sclerosis researcher. Ari and I would touch base with each other about our students’ progress and our styles of teaching. Over time, we realized something: though our subject areas were different, there was a notable pattern with both of our groups, which for a lack of a better term, we called the “threshold effect.” And for a lack of a better definition, we proposed that the “threshold effect” was when a student transitions from not understanding a particular concept (especially one where much effort had been applied) to understanding that particular concept, and they additionally overcome a cognitive block whereby many related concepts suddenly make sense when they hadn’t before. In other words, the understanding of that one hard-to-grasp concept led to a global understanding of the subject in unison. We noted that the student’s overall performance in the subject also improved following the “threshold effect.”   Given the all or nothing outcome of the “threshold effect”, we posited that optimal tutorial help could come at a point, during the course of studying or doing homework, when a student was near but had not overcome the threshold. So, if a student is studying and needed that immediate extra bit of help in understanding a concept to cross that threshold, we reasoned that a platform with on-demand tutorial services could have a positive outsized impact on the student’s performance in a class or subject. That then was our motivation for KnowNet. The tutoring sessions would have been conducted online through the KnowNet platform, with built-in online whiteboards and video streaming capabilities. But that was the extent to the details of the platform that we had vetted out before calling it quits. We had not come up with a pricing model, nor had we even broached upon the nuances of how interaction would take place between the student and the tutor. ‍",0,0
117," Great question and one that many founders probably do not ask themselves but jump straight into building a business.  My motive?  Just the idea of having a startup. The idea that I was ‘brilliant’, and smart, and I was going to build something new and cool, and show it for the world to see.  As a student, and working as a customer support rep at the time, I always knew I was going to be an entrepreneur, so there was my chance to ‘prove it’.  Yet still, I had: Zero previous knowledge of building startups and raising capital.  Zero-knowledge of mobile gaming, hardware, and prototyping. Just a big (read: useless) diploma in Marketing.  Heck, I didn’t even own an iPad. I bought one after I came up with the idea. 'Brilliant', ey? ",0,0
118," As a young person, I realized just how much my own brain got in the way of my athletic performance, relationships, and personal life. I had a really hard time with stress and confidence, especially when the stakes were high.  Curious by my own weaknesses I decided to pursue my formal education in psychology (undergraduate and a graduate degree in psychology).  Then, after my last decade of coaching and watching the effects of stress, anxiety, and depression across the globe I started to realize that stress may be one of the biggest problems to solve for humans.  I thought that with my education, experience, and vision, Kopely could contribute to helping solve this massive problem. Prior to Kopely, I had two “side hustle” attempts, “ableboxes” and “enhanceables.com”. Since my personal training business focuses on servicing many technology entrepreneurs I was eager to try to scale another business.  In short, ableboxes was a “personal trainer” in a box. This pre-packaged box offered several small pieces of equipment, workouts, and a video library. Enhanceable.com was a health and fitness content aggregator. Like Reddit (kind of), I was aggregating the beat health and fitness content to our website then having our community upvote or downvote content based on its value and trustworthiness.  I learned a lot from these two failed businesses (which included over $15,000). I learned that you have to: 1) have a clear problem that you want to solve for 2) streamline your solution so people understand what it is 3) figure out how the heck you’re going to get people to care about your solution.",0,0
119," Well, I always loved doing business. I started to work from a very young age as a door-to-door salesman first and then helping companies with their marketing strategies. Then later on, in 2006, I met the Digital Marketing world and since then I’ve built my entire career on it, driven by an inextinguishable curiosity for all of its facets. As I went deep into it, I started to specialize in email marketing, marketing automation, and lead generation. I used to partner up with professional across many businesses, from mechanics to wedding planners to psychologists, who wanted to monetize their skills. They brought their knowledge to the table, and I helped them sell it online, for example by helping them to make videos and create paid courses. One day I met Alessio with the same intention to help him out. He was a very talented developer and since we were a good fit, we decided to partner up. This time though, we decided to do something different. Instead of selling his skills and teaching other people how to code, we decided to develop a few projects together. We started by solving a few problems that many marketers were facing in their businesses. Our first project did really well and in a matter of months, it was already generating $10k/month. So, we decided to invest also in another project on the side. Since I had been in the market for a few years, I knew that one of the major pain points of marketers was connecting Facebook Lead Ads to their CRMs. So, we built LeadsBridge to solve that problem, starting with a very basic MVP.  I knew it had the potential to help many people, but I couldn’t anticipate its success. Soon it became our main focus of interest, and we kept investing in it in proportion to the traction it was generating. Two years and 1M$ in revenues after, it’s still growing strong. ‍",1,0
120," Legaats was a web app where baby boomers and senior citizens could store, categorize, and interactively share all their most important life lessons in video, text, or photo format to pass on to future generations. I was inspired by my own grandfather’s autobiography, where I learned a lot about his life and found lots of wisdom I didn’t get the chance to hear from him directly. I wanted to replicate that sensation everywhere, and I felt that no dominant consumer platform had succeeded in tapping the idea of building your “digital legacy.” I really loved the idea of mentorship & wisdom-sharing, so it made sense to me at the time. I also researched and found that half of the US population would be above the age of 50 by the end of 2017, that this age group controlled 70% of disposable income in the country and that they were suffering from the widespread epidemic of social isolation. Legaats was meant to help alleviate that problem!  ",0,0
121," I grew up in Santa Monica, California with my parents and three younger siblings. From an early age, I’ve found myself in highly competitive environments that can often turn quite stressful. The school I attended through 8th grade, Brentwood, was pretty rigorous, and it was hectic balancing schoolwork with the sports I played. I was fortunate enough to have been surrounded by some great role models—my mom and dad, coaches, and teachers—who encouraged me to take on challenges and responsibility without sacrificing wellness or perspective. Nonetheless, I found it tricky to obtain this balance day in and day out. For high school, I decided to set off on my path to expand my horizons, leaving LA to attend boarding school at Hotchkiss in Lakeville, CT. Looking back on it, it’s wild to think that I made such a major life decision at the age of 14, but I’m glad I opted to push myself. Hotchkiss was very tough academically––despite the talent of the students there, I witnessed a lot of my peers burning themselves out by the end of it. At the time, I was also playing quarterback for the football team working towards college recruitment added its unique pressure on top of everything else, and the combination bordered on overwhelming. When I started college at Columbia University, it had become clear to me that something needed to be done about the stress culture I’d witnessed everywhere I’d gone. Though Brentwood, Hotchkiss, and Columbia are all very different places, I noticed a consistent thread of students engaging in the “work hard, play hard” mantra and eventually buckling under its weight. Don’t get me wrong—I believe it’s very important to stay ambitious and goal-oriented. However, I noticed that oftentimes the partying, drinking, etc that my friends and I thought was “balancing” out our hard work was only decreasing our productivity and leading to more stress over time. To reach my own goals—pursuing my major in Internal Relations and minor in Ancient History, playing on Columbia’s rugby team, and of course, growing Leilo—I realized that my habits had to become more sustainable. That’s why I’m so passionate about our product I use it every day to soothe my anxiety and stay grounded, and I’ve seen it make a similarly positive impact in my community. As I enter my senior year of college, it is clear that Leilo has made a major and necessary difference in my life, allowing me to tackle the challenge of each new day with calmness and confidence. As crazy as it sounds, the eureka moment to create Leilo came the very first time I tried kava in 2018. I was on a random and fortuitous family trip to Fiji, hanging out with some locals I had befriended in a village near Pacific Harbour. We were sitting in a circle in one of their homes, sipping kava, and speaking like old friends even though we had met only a couple of days before. The warmth, generosity, and sincerity of the Fijians, which they largely attributed to the calming, regenerative powers of kava, really stood out to me, especially in comparison to my experiences in the States. I felt extremely lucky to be included in this kava ceremony but simultaneously saddened that I couldn’t share it with everyone back home. I remember sitting at dinner with my family an hour or so after the kava ceremony, the dilemma still gnawing at me. Though it would be hard to top enjoying kava from coconut shells on an idyllic beach in the South Pacific, there had to be some way to share the magical properties of kava, as well as that culture of friendship and optimism, with a greater audience. To everyone at the table’s surprise, including myself, I declared that I would find a way to make an RTD kava product and bring it to market. Though it was a fledgling idea, and though I had no experience in the F&B space whatsoever at the time, they believed in me. A lot of progress has been made since that moment of inception, but I am proud to say that it is those same people, my family, and friends in Fiji, who continue to be my closest advisers and supporters. As Leilo continues to expand, it’s essential to me that my company does not stray from our roots and the hospitality, loyalty, and love that made all of this possible in the first place.",1,0
122," I'm a Chemical Engineer (which has pretty much nothing to do with what I'm doing right now) and I’ve worked for companies like P&G and Hermés. Then I did a Master’s in marketing and this is where I started launching companies. I initially started a t-shirt business that didn't work really well, so I quickly moved on to LeadGuru with some friends. We made a bit of money, but I wasn’t really happy with such an unscalable business. At the same time, I was really intrigued by SaaS business models. I found it super interesting to be paying for different apps like Audible, which increased my curiosity around the software and tech space. Ultimately, I’ve decided to take a chance. With LeadGuru, we were within one of the biggest French incubators called STATION F. The two co-founders I partnered with on that project decided to move on from a company they were working on at the moment and we’ve ended partnering up to build something new. Since then, the idea hasn’t changed much. The differentiation factor was to bring personalization and cold emails together. But, as personalization of text already existed, we took it to the next level and introduced customization of images and landing pages. ‍",1,0
123," The idea was not mine. It was from my co-founder Iñaki Ecenarro. When I was negotiating my way out of Wuaki, I spoke with many people from the Spanish startup ecosystem because I was trying to find out what to do.  After talking with Iñaki at an event, he told me he was thinking about launching a startup in HealthTech or EdTech and I told him that I didn't want to start anything from scratch. I had promised my wife and family that I would join either a large corporation with a good salary or a more mature startup. I had very good opportunities and lots of interviews. But he insisted and we agreed to have a coffee. We met at Starbucks and he showed me a small prototype he had built himself around the concept of kids from 2 to 6 years old, spending too much time with mobile devices and tablets. It was a fact that kids would always end up on YouTube and that parents give their phones and tablets to them as a way of having more free time. The idea was to bring to parents and kids something entertaining, but at the same time a learning experience. We would help them learn the basic stuff that you learn at kindergarten. The kid would be entertained and he would opt-in for that rather than going to YouTube. ‍",0,0
124," I was working for a corporate Telecom company and in Pakistan for two years in B2B Corporate Sales and I saw that I wasn't growing enough. I was a really good sales & marketing person in that company, but I was not getting rewards enough. So, I started disliking my corporate life and the corporate structure. When I came to Germany as well, I started working for a big company that was acquired by Intel. But I soon understood that big companies were not my thing and that I had to join a startup. But rather than start working on my own business, I first wanted to have some experience in the startup industry so I joined a startup in Advertising Tech and that was my first startup experience. It was an incredible experience and I gain a lot of knowledge because I learned a lot about how startups work. My motivation to start Lieferoo was not only to make a lot of money but also to make some impact in the world. I also wanted to solve my personal problem which consisted of bringing things from Pakistan to Germany. I like a lot some unique stuff that is from Pakistan so I used to constantly ask my friends to bring me different things. Every time someone traveled to Pakistan I asked for certain things that couldn’t be found in Germany. But it then started to be quite annoying for me. I wanted to pay for someone who could just bring these things. I thought: “If people are paying other people to transport them, why wouldn’t people pay other people to transport them certain things?”. For example, the tea in Pakistan is very specific and I love it, but in Germany, it was really expensive. I soon also found that there were other people in Mexico and other cultural countries who wanted products from other parts of the world. That’s when I thought that I was solving a big problem. Before Lieferoo I was also studying consumer affairs and technology management at the Technical University of Munich. I wanted to move into only marketing as in Pakistan everything was marketed through traditional channels It’s great to emphasize that before Lieferoo, I also failed to build one business in a coaching center but we did not invest much time in it. ) This occurred when I was in University. I was really good in college at College Admissions, so I wanted to start a college admission test business so as to help people get into my University. It completely failed. The business idea was quite simple: we gave a free test version so that people could come to do it and receive the results and find if they were good enough for the college. If the results were low, they would come to a series of classes where we would teach them how to do the test properly. The failure reason was our location. We did these tests and classes in a small house located horribly where nobody could see it. Also, my target market wasn’t prepared to pay for the classes – they just wanted to see if they could pass the test (the majority didn’t).",0,0
125,"  I have known I wanted to be an inventor since I was eight years old. That is the year that my parents took me to visit Thomas Edison’s original laboratory in New Jersey. A laboratory assistant who worked with Edison directly chose me to demonstrate how a piece of equipment on display operated.  I had my heart set on being an inventor from that point forward, but my dad told me that inventor jobs no longer existed. Undeterred, I developed more than 100 patents over the next 50 years. My dad later apologized, and we get a good laugh out of it to this day. However, I hope this serves as a lesson to anyone who does not initially feel supported in pursuing their dreams. People often ask me how I came up with the idea for LifeWave. I worked at a company called AAG in 1999 as part of a team that developed survival equipment for the United States Navy. The naval crew in charge of a mini-submarine had to remain awake for 30 consecutive hours, and I wanted to find a solution that did not involve using stimulants, drugs, or caffeine. I did research for three years before I launched LifeWave. It was a big moment for me because I believed so strongly in the ability to naturally stimulate the body’s metabolism without resorting to artificial means. ",1,0
126," Before Linkody, I launched a previous startup with a friend of mine. However, this wasn’t a success and we soon gave up (this could be a story in the failed section ). I did learn my first lesson then. Don’t start a business with your friends just because they are your friends. By working on that first business, I eventually got the idea for Linkody. Back in the days, the only thing I knew about SEO was the importance of backlinks. I was doing link exchanges and needed a tool to check that my partners didn’t remove them. A lot of the existing tools were providing general reports about new and lost links, but none was offering to manually add links and check them on a daily basis.

We were kids and we were selling virtual server space for games like Counter Strike or World of Warcraft to other kids. We failed and discontinued the project when we all went our separate ways to different universities. During my studies, I started a new eCommerce project, an online pharmacy with automated delivery of commonly used products like toothbrush, razors, toilet paper etc. Even though I made it to the final of the Student Entrepreneur Awards, I decided to sell the project and move on.  I joined LiveAgent in 2013, and I was employee #10, the 1st and only marketing guy. I was 21 years old, not knowing what I was getting into but I experimented a lot and over the course of 4 years, I’ve helped the company grow from $20k to $250k in Monthly Recurring Revenue. ‍",1,0
128," It was my first take on entrepreneurship. I was so excited to jump in and start building it that I didn’t validate if the market needed it. Just wanted to scratch my own itch.  My main problem was, as I discovered, I was spending 50% of my time trying to figure out what tools to use to make something. It’s exciting we can create working web applications and marketplaces without writing code. I just wanted to make that process easier so people can spend less time trying to figure out what tool to use, and more time talking with users and customers to make something they love and need. ‍",0,0
129," I had a very typical middle-class upbringing, which prepared me to always follow the path of least resistance. By the 6th grade, I knew I’d be going to Oregon State University and studying business. 6 months before graduating, I had a job lined up as a portfolio analyst for a small investment firm. It was always just taking the easy road. Two things happened that changed that. 1) I started my desk job and realized it wasn’t anything like I imagined it being. The novelty of wearing a suit only lasts for so long.  2) I started in July of 2007 - which was at the peak of the stock market. By February 2009, the market had crashed. My boss was unhappy, our clients were unhappy, and I was unhappy. I needed a restart. I saved up all of my vacation time for the year to go to Carnival with my best friend Ryan in Rio. We spent two weeks hang-gliding over Rio, dancing in the Carnival parade, and even visiting Iguazu Falls, one of the seven natural wonders of the world. On the last day, we were sitting on Ipanema Beach, thinking “we should be able to do this whenever we want.” The day I got back I received a 20% pay cut. That was when I knew a change needed to come, and within two months I’d launched Location Rebel simply as a vehicle for change for myself, and to hold myself publicly accountable for all the things I wanted to do in life. I had two goals when I graduated college: Travel and own my own business. I wasn’t getting closer to any of those in my job, and this was the tipping point that encouraged me to pursue both. The first thing I did on the site was publish my bucket list. 100 things I wanted to do before I died. I started checking them off, and people started paying attention. I think the brutal honesty of where I was at in life, coupled with an attitude of “if Sean can make a big change, maybe I can too” is what initially helped to get some traction. ",1,0
130," Lockpick Entertainment was the first startup I ever worked with. It was a small game studio started by students at my school. Basically, some students figured out that the best way to get some experience was to start their own company. They did, and I joined them a year after that. We created a hybrid MMO RTS game called Dreamlords where thousands of players would play against each other and a rapidly collapsing world to level up their avatars in iterations of the apocalypse. Eventually to break the cycle (never happened though). ‍",0,0
131," In 2019, during our digital nomad stint, we’ve launched a newsletters network called Unreadit. It received a warm welcome online, great testimonials, and has been growing steadily since launch. Basically, we’ve created different newsletters with the best content on many topics, sourcing from Reddit. Initially, they were all manually curated, while now we’ve automated most of them, and just edit the most popular ones. It started generating revenue from sponsorship, but it’s really unpredictable: some months $0, others $1000. We also felt like it was time to take it to the next level and let users craft their own newsletters. That’s when we realized that this is something that could provide real value to people, and we wanted it ourselves: an app to create beautiful automated newsletters on any topic. So we started working on Mailbrew. Initially, it lets you create newsletters mixing any subreddit and RSS Feed, and offering few customizations. During the private beta, we added many features and possible customizations, and new sources like Twitter, Hacker News and YouTube. What started as a “tool to create automated newsletters” slowly became much more ambitious. A way to truly unplug from feeds, keep in touch with things and people you care about, and really be on top of your game by getting essential information on any topic, every day or week.",1,0
132," I’m not a perfectionist. My aim is to launch a fully-functional prototype and collect feedback from real users. That’s exactly what happened with KWFinder. I shared it on Reddit and the feedback was awesome. At that time, I didn’t think about Mangools, a brand that would cover more SEO tools. I had many different projects before Mangools. They included web development, affiliate websites, e-shops, domaining, and SaaS businesses. SaaS is a business field that truly attracts my attention. It gives me enough space to be creative and focused on the development of my own product. Before KWFinder, I developed some online marketing tools to cover my needs. I kind of hoped there would be more people with the same needs. I’m not a fan of deep analyses and business plans so I always use my intuition to evaluate the market potential. Why did these projects fail? Well, sometimes I lost the enthusiasm to finish them. In other cases, I missed the good old product-market fit. The competition on global markets is enormous so coming up with an idea that hits the market at the right time while customers are willing to pay for it is like looking for a needle in a haystack.",1,0
133," Before ManyRequests, I built two other companies. During my law studies, I started an apartment rental service for international students and expats. After that, I co-founded a design outsourcing service that is still going strong with a university friend. I have always had a passion for entrepreneurship. Starting and growing something from scratch gives me immense satisfaction.  The idea from ManyRequests came during my last business. Back then, we managed 30 designers and hundreds of clients, and the project management or help desk software available was not suited for that type of business. In addition, around 2018, I started relating my entrepreneurial journey online, mainly through a Facebook group called Productize.Community where I matched other service-based entrepreneurs. The combination of scratching my own itch and connecting with other entrepreneurs who experienced the same problem made me decide to start ManyRequests. ‍",1,0
134," I was focused on my consulting business before I met Aki Balogh, President & MarketMuse co-founder. I focused on SEO and content strategies to help clients solve technical problems and gain an advantage in search engine results. Previously I led the Traffic, Search, and Engagement team for seven years at TechTarget, a leader in B2B technology publishing and lead generation. I helped Aki drive the direction of MarketMuse based on my experience in the search field. I was responsible for the SEO strategy for dozens of websites at TechTarget. It takes hours to do the keyword, competitive, and link research required for a single article, no less for an entire network. I saw the potential in MarketMuse immediately around creating a single place for someone to automatically audit their site, identify gaps, seek opportunities and scale high-quality output -- and that’s what MarketMuse does today. We’re excited to get deeper into AI-generated content. We’ve been building and honing our model for a few years and believe this will be a game-changer for scaling content. It won’t replace writers, but instead, it will augment their process, especially for the less creative content types. Imagine writing descriptive product material for an entire catalog in a matter of hours instead of weeks writing by hand. The use cases for this industry are truly game-changing. ",1,0
135," When I think of how I came to be involved in Matboard and More, there are three important parts of my life that came together to make it happen. One, I got my first job as an engineer designing traffic control devices. I was actually really passionate about traffic... because I hated it! I hated the powerlessness of sitting in front of a green light and still not being able to move because of the thousands of cars ahead of me. Traffic to me is a symbol of how screwed up our society is. How willing we are to waste hours a day commuting to places we don’t like. It’s become an accepted part of life, sitting in traffic, but I couldn’t do it. I would get stressed out of my mind thinking… waste of time, waste of energy, stupid… so I got a job in traffic thinking if I was working towards solving the problem it would make things easier. It did for a short time but then I realized this problem was going to be solved with self-driving cars and nothing else. My bigger realization through working as an engineer was that I hated not having control. I couldn’t control my schedule, what I worked on, who I worked with and most importantly when I could take my damned vacations! So, I realized that my personality is simply incompatible with working the standard job, and I needed to find work that gave me freedom. This became crystal clear to me in 2010 and I spent the rest of my life ensuring I would one day achieve my goal of controlling my own life. Two, I didn’t really have a clear idea of what I needed to do in order to gain that freedom and control in my life but I figured quitting my job and getting an MBA was a good start. The next two years I spent a lot of time reinventing myself from a nerdy engineer with limited social skills into a pretty cool guy who was not afraid to ask life for more. I can say that I didn’t learn a tone academically in my MBA but I gained the confidence to know I could be successful at whatever I put my mind to. I wrote a blog about this at the time. Third, circumstances came together perfectly when my brother and brother-in-law came to with me this awesome idea. I can’t take credit for the idea or the initial startup phase, I got involved as the site was getting ready to launch. You can’t underestimate the power of having a good team. Now since this is Failory, I should mention that during my MBA I specialized in Organizational Behavior and was looking to get into HR Consulting. For the life of me though I couldn’t get an interview, save for one with P&G. I guess I did terribly because they didn’t take me past the phone interview. I was actually devastated at this point because it was about 4 months on the job hunt (with loads of MBA debt) without any leads before Matboard and More came into the picture. So, to summarize, my drive for control and freedom, my transformation during my MBA and great partners were what made Matboard and More possible for me.  ",1,0
136," My thoughts on the topic of exchanging food didn’t start until I was feeling antsy at work. I liked my job at RBC. I had great colleagues and a really cool boss, but I just felt I was making no impact. I was itching to do something and had dozens of ideas I was testing. I would spend Monday mornings chatting with airtime providers in East Africa to test a remittance idea. Create UI mockups of an app connecting professionals and ex-pats in a city. I even spent three months trying to sell portable mobile phone chargers to various concert venues with a friend. Most of these ideas went nowhere. Sometimes there would be some traction, or an introduction to someone doing the same thing, but ultimately it led nowhere. My frustrations were mounting. Simultaneously I started to notice myself gain weight and realize how hard it is to find a healthy meal for a good price in downtown Toronto. There was a third factor that really helped me push forward. While I may seem self-motivated, I needed something to keep me in check. I started a group called “Breakfast for Hackers” in Toronto. We would meet on the weekends and discuss various ideas. We probably had 10 meetings with all sorts of people trying to work on different ideas either looking for a brainstorming session, or feedback. It was fun, but people didn’t seem as interested after some time, and the meetings weren’t always well planned (my fault). The group disseminated but I kept in touch with everyone, pitching ideas constantly and obtaining some support. What happened early in 2015 is a combination of these things. The frustrations at work, the need for a healthier diet, and the hackers I met, all came together. I started to identify the problem I wanted to solve was health-related. I wanted a better diet at a price that made sense. My hacker friends felt the same way, and they pointed to solutions in the market which I thought were incredibly faulty. I was not happy with pre-made box meals. I didn’t want to, nor had the time to make food. And I was not going to ride on the soylent wave because it didn’t feel natural. There had to be another way that fit my diet and my budget. These frustrations continued to mount, and I kept asking myself ‘how can I eat better?’ At some point, the idea for MealSurfers was born. I don’t know if I had the idea swirling in my head, or if I had noticed and remembered certain situations from the past. Two things are for certain one, my mother used to make lots of meals for people in our community and we would exchange food constantly. Some of my best dinners growing up were made by friends or colleagues of my parents. If I really liked the dish, my mom would find the recipe and try to make the food herself. Her versions of the meal were never the same. Two, in my religion, the tradition of exchanging food has been around for centuries. It is likely that this was brought into practice to help the poor and build a community. The tradition exists today, and is sometimes the main reason why hungry university students come to our mosque. Noticing these two events in my life, I thought there was a potential for exchanging home-cooked meals on a large scale. It also helped that I was following Uber’s success very closely. I was very fortunate to work with some of the senior members on Uber’s team as they were doing a deal with RBC. Before the partnership, it was my job to do some due diligence, and make sure they were a good partner. I learned what I could about their model, and realized it could be applied to multiple markets. I probably didn’t realize it then, but I wasn’t betting on the technology, I was betting on people. I was betting that people would be more trusting of each other. I don’t think I was wrong, but my vision was definitely tainted. ‍ When I had a reasonably good idea of the business I wanted to test, I asked my hacker friends for their thoughts. In fact, I asked many friends for their thoughts. There was lots of criticism, sometimes disguised as doubt. I had pitched so many ideas, that no one believed I was actually going to start something. In some ways, the advice given was never really thought through. I guess that’s what I deserve for being the boy who cried startup! There were some friends who really did believe in the idea. They weren’t willing to jump on board just yet, but they were keen on seeing how things progressed. At such early stages, it’s hard to decipher the friends who are just interested, and the ones who really want to get on board. Many people will go so far as rolling up their sleeves, but only if their schedule permits. As someone diving headfirst into the idea, I was unaware that the team I started practice with, was not going to be the team I played the game with. This is a really important point because team is probably the number one thing that can make or break a company. When you read advice like this, it’s easy to brush over it. Any project I work on now, I make sure I get along with the team, that the group is motivated to succeed, and we all compliment each other’s skill set. I cannot emphasize how important this is. ‍ As I started to learn these lessons, I grew more confident in my idea. I knew I needed to do three things now. I needed to assess the regulatory framework in the food space, primarily in Ontario. I needed to check the competition, and create a solid business case for doing this. And I needed to run a basic test to see how people would feel about this product. ‍ TLDR: Friends, trends of unhealthy foods, no real competition, traditions in my family and the love of a good meal.",1,0
137," After graduating in 2018, I worked as a software engineer working on a mix of full stack development and signal processing. I also pursued a Masters in Computer Science with a focus on machine learning, which I just graduated from this Dec 2020! Late 2019, early 2020, I was at a sort of crossroads of what I wanted to do - I was actually early in the job search stage when I shifted focus fully on this startup. Melon's approach to food delivery was inspired by problems I, a frugal student, personally faced as a user like cost, reliability, and simplicity. Existing companies were trying to reduce costs by combining orders to shorten the number of trips, but only one to two drop offs at a time. What logistics changes could enable food delivery with 20+ items dropped off together? Would there be consumer demand of more people like me for such a product given the additional constraints that would arise? Tackling this problem appealed to me partly based on my past experience with startups. Atlanta and especially Georgia Tech has a deep startup and entrepreneurial culture, so I was exposed to many companies, industries, and founders. I had worked at a startup with high technical risk- meaning rolling out the product required technical innovations. However, testing out a food delivery concept has limited technical risk and financial risk. Entering the market and making progress is influenced more by business development and validating concepts with quick iterations, rather than having complicated software, and this new challenge interested me.",0,0
138," Before building MentorCruise, I was engaged in various forms of online education, such as MOOCs. Out of all these courses and schemes, it was the ones that offered 1-on-1 mentorship that had the most impact on me. However, these mentorship programs were mostly side-projects of these companies. The core was always the coursework. Once you didn’t do the coursework anymore, you’d also lose access to your mentor. Even more crucially: When you’re done with your course, when the crucial time of job-hunting and interviewing starts, your mentor is gone. As a career starter at 19 years old, I experienced this first-hand and found that many of my peers experienced this too. Many of us also were on both sides of the market – looking for a mentor and also mentoring students ourselves, so I decided to initially just create a little index of all of us. That’s how we got our first dozen users or so – I ended up talking to around 100 potential mentors before launching something and a few of them came from those learning communities. I had many attempts to build a business or to come up with a nice business idea I could work on, but this one was the first one that clicked and then also ended up making real revenue.",1,0
139," After graduating I worked as an internationalization consultant for 3 years. It was a great experience, but I felt it was getting too repetitive and needed a change.  In 2011, during a trip to India, I had the opportunity to get in touch with many Digital Nomads, young entrepreneurs who worked remotely and who managed their startups 100% online. I had already read the book ""The Four Hour Workweek"" by Tim Ferriss, but to meet the people who had brought that dream to reality had a great impact on me. At the beginning of 2012, a friend and I founded an online marketing agency in Spain. It started very well, but we had different criteria regarding the management of the company and after a few months I decided to sell my participation in the agency. My friend wanted to go all-in in expenses, even if our income had been way below what we expected. I wanted to bootstrap and increase our overhead as we grew. During the months I was with the agency I realized that almost all the available SEO tools were only in English (or poorly translated) and had prices that were not affordable by the smaller agencies in Spain and Latin America. In addition, at that time each tool covered a specific functionality of the many that an SEO agency needs in its day to day (on-page analysis, backlinks analysis, tracking SERP positions of keywords, reporting to clients, etc.). There was no complete suite in Spanish, and if you had to spend between 50€ and 150€ per month for each tool, the small agency that was starting was unable to make ends meet. I saw it clear, so I started to code. ‍",1,0
140," I was an unhappy software developer for years before I started working on side projects. This was the early 2000s, so there were no communities like Indie Hackers or MicroConf. I read Paul Graham and Joel Spolsky and started blogging around the same time as Peldi and Patio11, who were coming onto the scene around the same time. After several years of experiments and missteps, I lived full-time on product income and quit the day job and consulting in late 2008. It took me a few years before I stopped calling myself a developer and started calling myself an entrepreneur or business owner. Startups were a means to an end to me. I wanted three things, and I thought they could give them to me: I wanted the freedom to work on what I enjoyed. I wanted the purpose of working on something interesting. And I wanted to maintain healthy relationships by not working long hours or having a crazy commute and choosing who I worked with. I had started blogging about my journey in 2005, and by the time I quit the day job, I had built up a nice following. These were the days of RSS, and I think I had 15k or 20k subscribers. As I talked about my journey, I received a lot of questions about how I did it and turned those questions and the common pitfalls I could see developers making into my first book called ""Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer’s Guide to Launching a Startup."" I self-published the book hoping to make at least $5k or $10k, and it has proceeded to generate more than $300,000 in revenue over the past 11 years.",1,0

142," I cannot take any credit for starting Mongoose, that belongs to Marcus who designed the bat and brand, but the story of how I ended up working alongside him from launch through to our eventual failure is an interesting one... Back when I was 16, I was fascinated with sports equipment. Cricket was my chosen sport at the time, following England’s relative success, and I found myself enamoured with the manufacture of cricket bats. I ran a cricket equipment comparison website and forum which covered the best brands, to the point where I was banned from using the internet at school as I was too busy running the website. ‍ Leaving school following my GCSEs (exams we take as a 16-year-old volunteered to work a couple of days a week on a farm in Crewe sanding and finishing handmade cricket bats for a small family run business. Bringing in money by working at Toys ‘R’ Us and handing out newspapers the other 3 days a week. Through saving my salary, I eventually saved up enough to travel to India where I worked for 2 months in a factory in Meerut (where 90% of the World’s cricket bats are made) learning the ins-and-outs of the trade.  ‍ I returned to the UK on April 2009, and within a month I was contacted by a friend who had heard of a new cricket brand launching and I was introduced to the man behind that brand, Marcus. Marcus, is an expert in branding and had spent his career in the advertising industry, however, like me, his passion lied in cricket. Within a week of our initial meeting, I had moved down to London to work with him, managing the production of the bats. The hope that my understanding of the industry and batmaking, alongside his encyclopedic knowledge of branding and infectious energy would be a match made in heaven. ‍",0,0
143," When I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area from New York City years ago, I wanted to start and run my own tech company. I spent a couple years meeting people in the industry and learning and reading about tech trends before taking the plunge. I joined a now-defunct startup incubator/accelerator funded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s venture capital firm, Innovation Endeavors, which is where I met my co-founders and started MotionThink. In joining the accelerator, all founders came in without a pre-commitment to an idea. There was a co-founder “dating” process where we matched up with which co-founders we most wanted to work with, and once our teams were formed we embarked on a need-finding / design-thinking process to come up with a startup idea. MotionThink’s focus on freelance workers came out of this process. My background was in law, business, and finance. I am a licensed attorney in 3 states and worked at McKinsey and in private equity investing before starting MotionThink. ",0,0
144," My friend and I created MotoBox because we wanted to help developers create an ecosystem of applications built on vehicle data. The best description of the project can be found on our old Kickstarter project page. The project involved three components: An OBD-II reader with a wifi chip,A set of servers to collect vehicle data, andAPIs that served the data to developers (and to our internal app). The idea was that we'd allow developers to build applications that use vehicle data (things like speed, fuel use, RPM, sensor data, braking data, etc.) and also allows consumers to view their driving data through the app. At the time (2013) the idea seemed novel, but over the next few years, several other similar products were released. Our Kickstarter ended up failing, but we made some interesting connections. There was a guy in Denmark who really wanted our product to put in his fleet of rental cars. Unfortunately, since we didn't get the funding we needed, we scrapped the project, and it wasn't until years later that I really internalized how bad I was at finding initial customers. ‍",0,0

146," As a result of my traveling, I visited a lot of coworking spaces. I noticed that a lot of these spaces lacked processes to run smoothly. Resulting in a lot of missed opportunities, new members, and money. I asked some of the owners and managers about these struggles. They confirmed my observations. Were they willing to pay for it too? Sure, they said. That's all I needed to start building Muun. I set up a landing page outlining my vision and ideas for it and shared that with the world. That resulted in quite a few interested people. I interviewed some of them to get a better idea of their pains. This is crucial and something I learned after 10+ years of building (success and failing) businesses. If you don't have firsthand knowledge of the industry it's impossible to know which features should and should not go into that very famous ""MVP"".

147," After chasing winters around the world competing and running my own coaching businesses, I moved back to Auckland. There I spent time in a couple of sales roles with Frontside Media and Facebook, before becoming one of the team to start Uber in NZ. I held roles in marketing and operations in both NZ and Singapore at Uber, then finally as Country Manager for Uber Eats New Zealand until October 2019. After Uber reached a stable state in New Zealand, it began to consolidate operations and the New Zealand team didn’t have the punch it used to. This provided the opportunity for me to try my hand out on my own, and from my time working with many drivers at Uber, I saw car maintenance as an industry really behind the times in its digital progression. Before building My Auto Shop, I went through a period exploring many different business ideas, mainly in the Future of Food and Future of Workspace (what I knew). However, it was clear to me that there was already so much money being pumped into both of the spaces (i.e they were too sexy) meaning fiercely competitive and often over-funded. I wanted to look elsewhere, into maybe a slightly smaller market, but one without all the attention: car maintenance. In the last ten to twenty years, we’ve seen a massive advancement in technology in cars.  This corresponded with new generations generally becoming much less practical which has resulted in a huge gap of knowledge between a mechanic and a customer. Unfortunately, some mechanics have taken advantage of that gap.  Mechanics have been rated as some of society’s ‘least trusted people’ alongside used car salesmen and real estate agents. As you generally can’t work out your car’s problem yourself, you don’t know where to get your parts from, and you don’t know if the mechanic has fixed the issues until you’ve paid and driven away, you need to trust what they say and assume the price is fair. This makes for a pretty lopsided transaction. Auto repair is such a fragmented industry in New Zealand with 4600 independent garages, working on about 10 cars a day. They’re just trying to keep their heads above water, so no one has the capacity to rethink the industry. COVID definitely threw a spanner into the mix, and it did for us all across New Zealand. The business model of My Auto Shop changed a lot through the pains of lockdowns. We went from primarily an ‘Uber-style’ model for car maintenance with a team of drivers who used scooters to pick up and drop off people’s customers, but we transitioned into more of a booking platform for car maintenance. We learned heaps in the first few months.  But then of course COVID hit and we had to reassess what we were doing.  Throughout the lockdown, we decided to double down on the parts we can solve quickly - upfront pricing and trustworthiness We’re coming up to a year of the business existing, and we’ve learned and adapted a lot, but there's more to come.",1,0

I was building websites, apps, and digital experiences for big brands such as McDonald’s, MasterCard, P&G, and many more. At some point, I lost faith in advertising to make meaningful products and went on an accidental sabbatical (at that time, I didn’t even know it was a thing). Then I met Dennis, my co-founder, and we started tinkering with some ideas around improving our city through technology. It was back in 2012, and that space was beginning to see the first players to appear. In 2013 we came up with the idea to put a giant map of our city online and let anyone add any ideas about improving the city. We called it MyMurmansk, and in the first 48 hours, we collected almost 200 ideas. In a couple of months, the word started to spread about this website in Murmansk. We began to receive requests to build the same in other cities. This is where everything started. We decided to create a platform out of it and try to sell it to local governments. We called it MyCity, rolled up our sleeves, and got to work to make it happen. ‍",0,0

150," I love starting online businesses, and I love finding new opportunities to make money online. At the time, I had two successful online businesses up and running. AssociatePI, a website selling online courses in the insurance industry generating around $5,000 in monthly passive income. And Pomsky Owners Association, a blog generating around $750 in passive income. I just needed a little more income per month to comfortably quit my 9-5 job and pursue entrepreneurship full time. My goal was to generate $10,000 in income per month, that would give me a nice safety net to quit my cushy job as a financial analyst. I was on the lookout for new opportunities when I stumbled upon Greg Mercer of JungleScout and the Million Dollar Case Study. It’s a case study going through the process of manufacturing a physical product and launching it through the Amazon FBA program to generate $1 Million in revenue. I was always interested in the Amazon FBA program, but I had never seen how simple it was to get started until I came across the Million Dollar Case Study. I was hooked. The allure of launching a new business, one that could generate thousands of dollars in extra income each month drew me in. I followed the instructions from the Million Dollar Case Study step by step to find my niche and launch my product through Amazon FBA. ‍",0,0
151," I've always been an entrepreneur. I've always enjoyed having my own business and not having to go to work and to the office every day. So that's a pretty big motivation for me. I enjoy running teams and working with people. And I am always looking for an opportunity. Anywhere there's money to be made I want to try that thing out And I have no problems trying things that I think are going to fail as well, like the aviation website. We're going to be building it, although I believe it is most likely that it’s going to fail. But that's it's not really a big deal. I'm just going to lose a couple thousand dollars and that'll be it. On the other side, I will have lots of new experiences and new knowledge. The first websites that I did were a failure. I didn't really understand a lot of the necessary components of sites, like how to make it nice and how to increase converting customers rate. Wet Shave Club was also a failure as we dissolved it. Even though our revenues were large, it was really difficult to make any profit off it because it was a physical product. As we grew, we had to spend more and more money on more products. It became a huge cash flow issue. This shows that even if your business is successful and generating revenue, it doesn't mean that you're going to succeed. Failure is just a natural thing and I look at it as “I’m just going to try this out and if it works great, but if it doesn't work, it’s also fine.”. One strategy that I have found that is great to avoid failure is to never start a business unless there's another similar business that's successful in the market. Anyway, a lot of people overthink failure and believe a business failure is the end of the world and that everyone's going to be laughing at them. And this is not true. And I want to emphasize that even generating revenue, your business won’t be successful. GrooveJar, for example, was making fifteen hundred dollars a month. That was a great site income, but for me, it wasn't really growing and it was taking me a lot of time with customer support. I also didn’t feel really excited about the project so I just decided to move on. Success is kind of relative and it can really be a lot of different things. But let’s move to NerdPilots. The reason behind the creation of it is that I wanted to see what people's projects were and help them with them. I enjoy the beginning stages of businesses where you have an idea and then it actually becomes like a business that can make money.",1,0
152," I was trying to launch projects on Product Hunt, so when I left I had a project to work on. I tried many ideas and people seemed to be interested but no one actually paid for anything, no one ever bought anything. I found out the interest came with how I was putting these projects together with Typeform, Carrd, and Zapier to make it feel like it was a real service, a real product.   I had like 1500-2000 people on the email list, but no one paid for any of my projects. I went back to the drawing board. I saw some screencasting companies on Indie Hackers like GoRails. They were making $15,000/month. So, why don't I film myself creating stuff, and then people can pay and get access to that? I messaged my email subscribers telling them I was going to do some video tutorials. 15 people paid. I needed to set up a company and I called it newCo because I couldn't think of a name. It was basically a Webflow site with a link to a payment page, which was another Carrd site. When people paid, I emailed them a password which was called ""positivebananas"". You use that to get to the protected page on Webflow and then you get access to the tutorials. ‍",0,0
153," I’ve had A LOT of failed projects over the years. It took me almost 10 years of making no money online to finally launching my first successful project. After I broke the failure ceiling, I then had 3 projects get acquired in the next 2 years. Before that, I had pivoted from idea to idea, rarely seeing any success but learning at least one thing with each project. Over time, I hit so many pitfalls that I then had a pretty good understanding of what NOT to do and I found that the projects I’ve started since have all been much more successful, by knowing to avoid those same pitfalls. The idea for No Code Founders started as a way to meet people similar to myself. I had discovered a tool called Bubble.io and used it to build a remote job board called Remote Circle, which was later acquired by We Work Remotely. It was through using Bubble that I discovered the no-code movement and realized there was a term used to describe people similar to myself. Up until that point, I felt like a non-techy needle in a haystack of developers. I wanted to meet more of these no-coders and NCF (No Code Founders) was my idea on how to do that. I started it as a Slack group and posted it on a couple of forums. After a couple of weeks, it had 100 members and it grew from there. ‍",1,0
154," After I realized hieroglyphics werenʼt paying the bills, I taught myself how to code and started a web design studio after college. I began building websites for clients, but after they started asking me how to drive more users to their sites, I found my personality and traits lean more towards marketing, the intersection of creative communication, engineering, and data analytics.  Growth became a new curiosity of mine, and I eventually joined the Bing team at Microsoft, then the digital experience team at American Express. These roles helped me gain some marketing and growth experience, and I ended up falling in love with that part of the job.  Since then, I've worked for many VC-backed tech startups, including the director of growth marketing at CGS, then working as a growth lead at Harver, a leading startup in the AI recruitment space, as well as Workzone, a project management software startup. All these experiences taught me how to build growth teams from the ground up, design a GTM strategy, and discover the ingredients that drive acquisition or retention growth in a hyper-competitive market. I later became a startup growth advisor for various accelerators and venture funds to help founders define and understand their growth strategy. I quickly realized the limitations of being a solo consultant and the power of being part of a team. As the demand increased, I decided to build the growth team I've always dreamed of when I was in-house, so I started what is now NoGood. ‍",1,0
155," It all started when my cousins and I were queuing up to enter a club. There was some popular DJ playing on that particular day, and the club was packed and the queue was insane. We began talking about how we could book tickets to movie theaters, yet still had to queue to enter a club. What began as a small discussion eventually led to the birth of NOX.  The main idea of NOX was simple, we wanted to create a nightlife app where users are able to buy entrance tickets to clubs and pre-order drinks (if they wished so). This would help users to plan their night better, instead of spending their time waiting in line to enter a club. ",0,0
156," At the time, I was living in Tokyo, Japan. I had pivoted out of a career in English teaching into corporate sales. During an earthquake one day, I reached under my office desk and found a survival bag that was entirely outdated with very poorly made products. Not only was this inconvenient, but it surprised me!  This is Tokyo - a tech capital and in one of the most earthquake-prone countries on the planet. Additionally, given how long most people commute in Tokyo, I thought — “this is all they got to make it home?” I also realized that I didn’t even own a survival kit in my own home! Upon inquiry with friends and colleagues, many people had no “bug out bag” (72-hour prep kit) for a major catastrophic disaster either. In addition to my demanding corporate job at the time, I had also picked up some marketing skills on the side by promoting nightlife events and blogging about it. I knew a few things about startups, and one of my favorite websites was Kickstarter. I was living paycheck to paycheck, and with all the work (corporate, events, and blog), I was hardly sleeping. My life felt like an endless grind. I needed a way out ...and that was Okami Pack. ‍",0,0
157,"  In my teenage years, I was an Evangelist. That may sound like an odd place to start, but much of who I am grew from that. I spent my days pitching ideas, often to people who weren’t interested, and I learned a lot about resilience in the process.   I left that world and became a tech entrepreneur. I started a lot of different companies, some of which were more successful than others. Then, I started Ombori. It was originally a consultancy company, and that facet of the company is still in existence. The profits from that consultancy piece of the business have enabled me to fund my other ventures, which all operate under the banner of Ombori Group.    Ombori Apps - which will shortly be rebranded as Ombori Grid, the name of our flagship product - is one of those. We started off trying to build a social shopping platform, then we moved into mobile apps, and now it’s evolved into this whole new thing.",1,0
158," Otto and I are longtime urban paddlers. We’ve been canoeing in the waters of Ghent, Belgium for more than 10 years, every week, after work. Storing a canoe in the city proved quite a challenge though, and after years, you tend to have seen all there is to see in a city. Even in Ghent. We wanted to explore further. So, our first intention was to buy a collapsible canoe already on the market. But in 2013, the options were really limited. We could only choose between inflatables, which have very bad performance on flat water, or skin-over frame canoes, which are expensive and take way too much time to assemble. We wanted to canoe after work, so we couldn’t waste time assembling. Hence the idea to make our own canoe. Otto made the first drafts and paper models, allowing us to start an innovation project that was eventually funded by the state. With Thomas’ technical knowledge, those drafts could also be transformed into reality and thanks to Dominique, we are able to grow sales so we can continue improving the canoe and even start applying our origami technology to other products & industries. Considering our backgrounds: both Otto and Dominique used to work in AS Adventure, the biggest outdoor store chain in Belgium. Otto as a salesman, Dominique as sales & outdoor manager. Both know the market very well and given Otto’s passion for product design and studies as a graphic designer, he did a very good job drafting & improving the canoe. Dominique, on the other hand, knows even more about sales and has managerial experience, which proved to be very handy. Thomas is our technical guy. He studied Engineering Physics, worked as a Software engineer in a CAM business and successfully ran a web development company. He played an important role in bringing the canoe into reality, including the development of our patented origami material and technologies, and manages everything that has to do with Production, technology, IT and Legal within the business. ‍",1,0
159,"  Onepagetrip was a travel itinerary sharing community. There, you could find itineraries from different people, pick the ones you related with and using trip planning tools you could mix them up and build your own itinerary. This 1 min video shows how the product used to work. I was really lucky with the team. We were 3 founders, myself, Jose who was working for Expedia and Lucas who was an incredible tech guru with more than 20 years experience and an amazing person to work with, learned a lot from him. We worked together for more than 1 year but we couldn’t make any money out of it. We built a product without testing the idea first, we underestimated our competitors, Jose and I kept our daily jobs which was a huge mistake and we were just rookies in this startup world. For one year the 3 of us were working on building the best product we could and on promoting the product the best we could with a very limited budget.   ",0,1
160," In 2012, I graduated from a small school in Pennsylvania called Grove City College, where I got my degree in finance. After graduating, I worked a few jobs in corporate finance and absolutely hated it. The sad part was that almost everyone I worked with also hated their jobs, and would trudge through their misery week after week, motivated only by the promise of a weekend off, or those glorious 2–3 weeks of vacation each year. The golden handcuffs are a very real thing. A few years ago, I had the opportunity to leave the corporate finance world and join a startup that a former classmate from college was starting. I came on board to help with marketing, but took a pretty substantial pay cut from what I was making before, as the founder of that company had only raised a small friends-and-family seed round to get things up and running. That ultimately didn’t end up working out, as we ran through the money faster than projected — the development of the site and mobile app was being outsourced to freelancers, and, fun fact, those development costs never really end. However, that role gave me great experience, and made me realize that it’s possible to actually enjoy work. Prior to that, I had never felt that my contributions actually made a difference in the large organizations I was working for. After spending a little time doing some freelance marketing and working on a few no-code side projects, I joined my co-founder Vishal Kumar at OneUp. We created OneUp to help increase the visibility of content on social media. Whenever you share something on social media, it is typically only seen by roughly 5% of your followers. Despite this, most people put crazy amounts of time and effort into creating social media posts and share it just once across their social media channels, guaranteeing that most of their followers will never see that post. OneUp helps these people by automatically driving traffic and engagement to the content that they have worked so hard on producing. ",1,0
161," *openmargin started as our graduation project at university back in 2009. Every school project always ended up getting shelved at the end of the semester, so we want to do something different this time. Build a business we got continue after graduating. One question we kept coming back to is how we’d present ourselves on the job market. Our study was a blend of many disciplines, from design to software development, to project management and branding strategy. How do you fit that on a business card? After many brainstorming sessions, we realized that showcasing your book collection and the notes you make within them, is a really good representation of who you are as a person. This eventually led to the idea of publicizing your notes and highlights. Initially, we came up with an iPhone app you could write notes in while reading a book. But when the first iPad came out, we saw the potential of it becoming an e-reader. So we pivoted to an iPad app instead. Allowing you to make notes right inside the book. ‍",0,0
162," In college, I realized I could learn a lot more outside the traditional education system than within it, so I started working remotely for startups. And after I finished college, I got excited about working for startups in the education space. I ended up working for a startup called Microverse, which is an online school for software developers that doesn't charge them until they get a job. That business model is called an income share agreement. I joined as the first employee and I didn't know the founder outside of Twitter. The business was unique for two reasons:  1) the education was almost exclusively done through peer-to-peer dynamics and 2) it was the only education program in the world using a global income share agreement. By the time I left, about 14 months later, they had students from more than a hundred countries and helped folks learn software development and get jobs earning on average three times their previous income. It was inspiring to see. I wanted to 100x that impact, and that’s where the idea for Pactero came from. It was a platform to simplify the process of managing income share agreements and contracts. ‍",0,0
163," I studied both business and CS in university before dropping out and moving to Thailand. During my first few years in Thailand, I was working for a travel company doing web development and other IT-related tasks. I had a tremendous freedom during this job to start projects and experiment with things. This allowed me to grow my coding chops as well as create a taste for starting projects and side-businesses. After leaving this job, I have started numerous projects and business (ending up selling one as well). Most of these projects didn’t result in anything great, but I simply enjoyed creating stuff. Since not all of these projects were generating income, I was often doing consulting and freelancing work on the side. I guess you could say most of the projects I started “failed”. However, I don’t really like that word, as they don’t feel like failures too. All of them were awesome learning experiences and great fun to build. One of my more recent “failures” is a product named “Failswitch”. It was a tool which would prevent your website from being down, ever. I think the reason this failed was due to the fact I was not able to define a clear audience for this, beyond simply “people with a website” (which is way too broad). This pretty much ingrained the idea that for a small, bootstrapped business to succeed, having a clearly defined market in the early days, as well as a channel to reach them, is very important. Another hugely important lesson I learned after numerous built-out products without any customers, is that validation before the building is critical. It’s hard, especially for us coders, not to right away dive into code when having an idea for a business or project, however doing so almost always results in a product without users/customers.  I was also active selling WordPress themes and HTML templates on ThemeForest during these years. This lead me to start building my first website builder script. It was mostly aimed at HTML template sellers, allowing them to bundle the script with their products and thus allowing customers to easily modify these HTML templates (even to this day, there are still numerous HTML templates available on ThemeForest which use our script). I quickly started seeing other types of customers buying the simple site builder script like web development agencies, marketing firms, hosting companies and internet marketers. We started seeing a demand for this type of product (with numerous additional features our product didn’t have at the time). I started building additional site builder scripts with better features and started selling those as well on CodeCanyon. This was a nice business for several years with decent monthly income (around $5,000 a month). However, at some point, I started growing tired with selling through a market site like CodeCanyon. We had now ways to contact our customers and we starting seeing CodeCanyon’s parent company Envato moving into a direction we did not like. So, we (at this point I assembled a small team) decided to build and sell the next iteration of our site builder tool, now named Pagestead, outside of the Envato ecosystem. This turned out to be an excellent decision, as we’re now 100% in control and are making more money than we did selling on the Envato sites. Below you’ll see a screenshot of Pagestead’s page builder interface: ‍",1,0
164," I'm a hacker and spend a lot of time reading Hacker News and building projects that I think are fun and interesting. To do this, you need domain names. One day I was looking for a domain name and found that it had expired. I did a lot of research to see how I could get it. I didn't get it, but it lead me to explore the domain name system in more depth. I started park.io in my spare time while I was working full time at WizeHive. I co-founded WizeHive and was CTO there for several years. I quit last summer to focus on park.io and other projects for Humbly. I failed at a million other projects before park.io. This is the advice I give other entrepreneurial-leaning hackers: Launch a lot of different things. 99% will fail, but there will be one that is a hit. It is obvious when it doesn't work, and it is obvious when it does work. Try a lot of things and when you get the one that works, focus on it for a while. As a developer, there isn't a lot of risk to launching a software service. Mostly it is just a risk of time, but even if nothing comes of it, you get the experience of trying. And the potential reward is huge. It is a good risk/reward bet to keep launching projects.  In the case of park.io, I didn't really start with an idea. It was more of just doing things I was interested in during my spare time. Eventually, I had done enough work on my own that I realized I could set it up as a service. ‍",1,0
165," My first major Internet business success was with the crowdfunding site GoGetFunding.com. It’s a business I continue to run, and I’m humbled to say that we’ve grown to be one of the largest fundraising sites out there, helping people raise millions each month for causes they care about. I’d tirelessly work on the site, and eventually, that led to chronic pain throughout both of my arms, diagnosed as Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). This left me unable to work, and even perform basic daily activities. I went through years of failed treatments, which culminated in two invasive and unnecessary surgeries on both of my arms. It’s only once I met a physiotherapist with knowledge of pain science that I was able to understand and treat my pain. She explained how due to years of pain and pain-anxiety, my nervous system had become overprotective and sensitized - causing pain at any hint of danger. I had to train my brain and body away from pain. I discovered that there are decades of science on central pain sensitization. I learned that when pain persists beyond three months, our brain and nervous system start to learn pain and irrespective of the condition of your body, you can continue feeling real pain long after an injury has healed. That didn’t mean the pain was all just in my head or that I could simply think it away. It meant that I needed to practice both mind and body techniques to train my nervous system to be less sensitive and protective. I finally understood how trying to find and fix ‘issues in the tissues’ that could explain the pain, was doomed to fail. No amount of physio, surgery, or diet changes could cure my pain. Instead, I had to tackle every thought, belief, and behavior that was keeping me locked in a pain cycle. Using evidence-based mind-body techniques, I was able to become 100% pain-free in just a couple of months. Life-changing. I realized just how many millions of people around the world continue to battle with chronic pain, which will fail to find relief unless they take a complete approach to pain treatment. This fuelled immense motivation to create a product that could take a skeptical pain sufferer like me, to being pain-free. There was nothing like that out there, and knowing a product like this could make a huge difference to so many people, I decided to create it.",1,0
166," I have been what many people call a “serial entrepreneur” for a few years now and I think it stemmed from a few different sources. When I was in college I was very involved in a lot of different extracurriculars and always had a full day of class, studying, internships, and meetings. Naturally, when I graduated, I had a lot of free time, even with a full time job. So I decided to start a housekeeping company in Asheville, where I grew up.  For a while, my brother and I talked about starting a business in Roanoke, where he lives. He was in the Marine Corps for 7 or 8 years and I guess he was sick of people telling him what to do. We tossed out ideas like another housekeeping company, a home health business, and even a landscaping company, but none of those stuck.  In 2017, Matt started working for a chimney company in Roanoke and began thinking this is a great industry to be in. It’s very profitable and you’re doing good work making homes safer. He really liked the company he worked for, but he noticed some inefficiencies and nobody listened to his ideas on how to improve the business. During this time, Matt and I would go back and forth about what he should do - either starting our business or continue waiting his turn to speak up about growing the company he worked for.  Eventually, a few of his paychecks bounced, so we decided it was a great time to start Patriot Chimney, so he got Billy, who also worked for the chimney company and served in the Marines with Matt, on board. They started doing a few jobs on the side and the company they worked for eventually caught wind and fired both Matt and Billy a couple of weeks after we started. Truthfully, the plan was to go slow and do work on the side until the other company went belly up. I think Matt and Billy getting fired was the right kick we needed.  ‍",1,0
167," My background is Back-End & Embedded Software Engineering. While I was working in a company as an embedded software engineer, I met with Asana and I didn’t find it sufficient. My idea was that current tools at that time were not able to help with project management. They just allow you to keep some records, nothing more. So I decided to make a project management tool that could report useful information to project managers, especially in project planning.  For example, if there is a new task to assign, this project should suggest which team member is the best fit in terms of time and skill set. We wanted to develop a project management tool that helps to manage and not only keeps records. ‍",0,0
168," ‍ I’m a big believer in free speech. Reddit has had its issues with silencing certain communities over the years. It’s a private company that’s their right. But I believe there should be somewhere online where you can voice opinions that are outside of the Overton window. My background is in web programming -- primarily backend development, but I know enough front-end to cobble together an okay-ish Bootstrap-powered site. Phez was just a side project for me. I built the initial prototype over a few long weekends, then continued to iterate on it over several months. I’ve been doing freelance Ruby on Rails development for the last five or six years. Phez definitely wasn’t my first rodeo in the side project game. I have literally lost track of how many little side projects I have created over the years. That may be indicative of a problem area for me -- that I don’t give an idea enough time to flourish. It’s very hard to tell when one should “put down” one of their darlings and move on to potentially greener pastures. (In hindsight, something similar to Phez has actually done fairly well in the marketplace, by many accounts: Steemit. It is a social network backed by its own cryptocurrency. It’s a great idea, but much more ambitious than what I had in mind with Phez.) ‍",0,0
169," Phoenix was a SaaS app to send a last message to the people you love when you die, you just entered the platform and start writing some messages (like an email) then you include the email of the people you want to send it when you die. I got the motivation behind this one day I was thinking about death, and I thought: ""One of the saddest things about death is that when you leave, you leave your ideas as well, your vision and the things you always wanted to say and do"". Then I thought of a way to send whatever you want to the people you care about :) I know what you are thinking, how the hell is Phoenix going to know when am I going to die? Well, pretty simple, there was a section in the app that acted like a button (I called it the Check-In) in there you just had to click on it to let Phoenix know you are still alive! If you don't press it after a year, Phoenix will suppose you're dead, and will send the letters! ‍",0,0
170," My wife and I used to shoot weddings. You've undoubtedly seen a photobooth if you've recently attended a wedding. Many years ago, we noticed booths all over the place and thought to ourselves, ""Why not get one of those?"" We purchased the ""old"" type photobooth. It became evident that it wasn't very portable, and the photographs weren't beautiful. I reached out to a couple of metal vendors in Orange County, asking if they could put anything together for me. I needed something slim and portable, but it had to be able to shoot beautiful photos as well. My wife and I worked for weeks on getting the images right, and we created a few interesting-looking prototypes in the meantime. Our friends immediately approached us, asking if we could put something together for them as well. So we secured a place at the world's largest wedding photography show which was set to take place in three weeks. We built a website, branding, promotional videos, a trade show exhibit, a prototype unit, a sales pitch, pricing, and everything else in that time frame. We sold over ten booths at the exhibition and quadrupled that amount the following week. We manually delivered one of the booths to a customer in Vegas a month later, and I used the money to purchase an engagement ring. Six months later, we were married. After that tradeshow, we just kept putting in the effort to offer additional resources and value to assist our clients in generating more money: marketing materials, sample contracts, training videos, instructional webinars, and other resources. We went from selling photo booths to selling a complete business opportunity in a short period, all without any franchise fees or the requirement for an initial financial commitment.",1,0
171," I started a bachelor’s degree in computer science in 2009. I have always been a fan of the web, and I was making some experiments, games, etc. I monetized my games with ads and that was my primary source of income while studying ($100 - $400 a month). In 2012, I had an idea to make a website for displaying PSD files. I wanted to show a list of layers and allow the user to hide/unhide some of them. The first version (PSD viewer) was released in 2013. Gradually (after thousands of hours of work), it turned into a full graphics editor. I was still studying, so Photopea was my free time activity. I finished my master’s degree in 2017 and I have been working only on Photopea since then. ‍",1,0
172," My professional background is in marketing. I have a bachelor in marketing management and have worked in digital marketing from the start of my career. I've worked for large public-listed companies and small venture-funded startups in areas such as affiliate marketing, social media marketing, and content marketing.  My co-founder Uku started Plausible last year and I joined earlier this year. Our story and experience with Google and its products is similar. A few years ago, I was a big fan, using several of their tools for many hours every day, loving them and recommending them to my family and friends. Over the last couple of years, I’ve become more aware of Google’s size, its business model, and how their dominance negatively impacts the web that I love. I started looking more into better and more ethical alternative tools, I started blogging about them on my site and that’s how Uku found me and got in touch. The idea with Plausible Analytics is to provide an independent web analytics tool that’s built around respect and privacy. We aim to strike the balance between giving some useful information to the website owner so they understand what their efforts result in but at the same time comply with all the privacy regulations and not be intrusive and invasive in terms of visitor’s privacy. We’ve built Plausible to be as privacy friendly as it can be. We don’t use any cookies, we don’t collect any personal data such as IP addresses, we don’t have any persistent identifiers, we don’t track people between their devices and between the different sites and/or apps they use, and so on. ‍",1,0
173," I’m strongly introverted so I know all too well the pain of being crippled by shyness and social anxiety that can make making friends incredibly daunting. I tried all the social networking apps I heard of but they simply didn’t work for making friends. Over the years, I started noticing others, even extroverts, having similar problems. As I learned about the loneliness epidemic, I realized the world needs an app that actually works, helping people easily meet others and create friendships. So I began working on this as a side project in 2016.  Using my background in psychology, I was determined to remove as many psychological barriers and cognitive biases as possible. For example, I addressed the Paradox of Choice by replacing the standard swiping functionality with a button that would instantly match you with someone compatible nearby. I believed at the time that this particular decision would also help mitigate the “chicken and the egg problem” because users would not see how many (or few) others were in their area as I grew the user base.  I knew I wanted to make Playdate centered around activities from the start. I had made most of my friends through common interests and mutual activities, such as playing poker or drinking together. There was also a McGill study that demonstrated that strangers would exhibit friendship-levels of empathy after playing a video game for 15 minutes together. I figured if two strangers did something that they were both passionate about, this would increase the chance of them getting along. And even if the friendship didn’t stick, neither person would feel like they wasted their time because they were doing something they would want to do anyway. Playdate was always activity-focused, but the big question remaining was which activity to start with. I considered “Magic: The Gathering” because it’s a popular game that requires 2 or more players to play, and Magic players are sometimes known to have trouble making friends. Embarrassingly, I have played against myself in the past because I had nobody else to play with. Ultimately, I decided against Magic and went with cannabis consumption. This was because cannabis is a social lubricant that can help people feel less anxious hanging out with new people and the legalization revolution had begun across the world. I also hypothesized that stoners would be more willing to try an app like this and would be more amenable to giving feedback. In hindsight, this choice of first vertical would be one of the reasons for Playdate’s downfall. ‍",0,0
174," I grew up on a small island called Guam, the one that NK keeps threatening to blow up (before). I came to the US for college, I have a degree in International Business, but I started my first business while I was still in College selling artificial silk flowers. So, my silk flower business evolved into a personalization business when my silk flower supplier moved 2 doors down from my storefront. We had to change our product offerings in a jiffy. I have always been lucky - I had a friend who helped me switch product offerings. Within months, I was able to find a new line to sell without struggling too much (well, it was still a lot of work, but it was also really exciting).  As that business changed, I started a mail order wedding catalog. I was even one of the first supplier to TheKnot, until they built their own fulfillment facility. Then I discovered the Yahoo eCommerce platform in 1997 and decided to open our first online storefront. It was definitely a learning curve. I am not technical so I can’t code to save my life (even to this day). That prodded along. Eventually, I sold my share of the retail storefront to my partner and purchased his share of the online store. The day the ink dried on the contract, April 1st, the site got penalized by Google. So now I had the challenge of trying to get it back to page 1 on different keywords. It took us 6 months, but we did it. And this time we were ranking in a better spot – we crawled our way up to page 3 from page 11. I taught myself SEO, made lots of friends in the SEO community and eventually our site made it to page 1 for multiple search keywords. Then I built several websites, designed and imported a line of bags all to support our main business which was personalization.  After a few years, I sold the business to the world renown wedding platform called TheKnot. Since then, they have closed the site down. My baby has gone, but I am really proud of what I was able to learn and accomplish through that experience. I worked for TheKnot for a year and then I left and took some time off. During the year 2010 was when all the back pain really went into full cray mode. I had been working a lot of long hours. That was part of the reason I left my job – I thought I just needed the rest.  So, I renovated the house, stayed home with my kids, started thinking about what I would do next. I love business, my business, other people’s business, and I thought that one way that I could continue to learn is to work with other business owners. I love trying to understand how people make decisions, why people do what they do – it has always fascinated me. So, I just started consulting. I soon realized that, since I was relatively new to the consulting world, I needed something to get me in front of eCommerce business owners, who wanted to improve their business process, grow their revenue and build up their team. So, I decided that one way to let people know that I could help with that was to write a book. It also helped me in getting speaking gigs and interviews. Overall, I just wanted people to know what they were getting themselves into when they decided to go into eCommerce. It's not a build it and they will come, it's not a set it and forget it. It’s a lot of work and people needs to be prepared for that. Throughout this period, I was on my computer a lot and my back pain was getting worse. I consulted for a while and then I went to work for Yahoo for a few months. When all was said and done, our team got laid off and so I had to decide what to do next. I decided that I really missed the retail business – It was my true passion. By then, the retail and eCommerce landscape had really changed – it was now Amazon’s world. So, I turned my energy into learning the ins and outs of Amazon. We’re selling a few products on Amazon, nothing tremendous that I can brag about – More struggles than winners, but it really taught us a lot.  Back in early 2017, a good friend encouraged me to speak about a product idea I had a few years back. That person was Kevin Harrington, one of the original Sharks on The Shark Tank programme. I drew the product for him and I sent him a video of my first prototype. He was pretty intrigued and he told me about another product that I actually never heard of. He also basically said to me that he thought my posture corrector/trainer was a great product and that I should pursue it. So, with his encouragement, I just started hunting down a factory that I could work with. I then kept working on the product design until I finalized on the new version that we have today.",1,1
175," In 1996, as a young Software Engineering graduate, I got my first job in Serbia’s first ISP (Internet Service Provider). At a time, Serbia was recuperating from bloody war in Balkans (1991/1995), so the economy and the IT infrastructure were really poor. As a young engineer I was tasked with building some of the first websites in Serbia. I liked it so much that I started creating websites in my own time - first for my hometown (Bijeljina in Bosnia), then for my favorite bands (Oasis, etc) and finally my favorite football club - FC Red Star Belgrade. People in our part of the world are passionate about football, so when first FC Red Star’s website went online - it attracted huge number of visitors (at that time - ‘huge’ in Serbia meant a couple of 000s visitors per day) - mostly Serbs living abroad, nostalgic about their favorite football club. I was acting as both webmaster and content (forum) moderator. Soon enough, I started receiving emails like ‘where can I buy Red Star jersey?’. I started replying like ‘Sorry, no official merchandise is available yet’, but after 5 or so such emails, I figured out that there was an opportunity. So, I built my first online store, arranged the way to receive payments from abroad (which was a nightmare at a time in Serbia).  Few months later, Serbia (actually, at that time it was still called Yugoslavia) qualified for the World Cup Football (France 1998) so I saw an opportunity to sell national football gear. However, there was a political problem - Red Star supporters were hard-core Serbian nationalists, and they would not tolerate Yugoslav football jersey in their fan store. So I had to build my 2nd store (YU Sport Shop). When the time came to open the 3rd such store, I realized I needed a generic software that could run N stores in parallel. Like many other young Serbs, I had left my country (I lived in Holland for 6 years), but I hadn’t shut down the business. I had found partners who would take care of orders and the merchandise itself, while I was still busy with online part of the work. By 2005, when I moved back to Serbia (which is not so common, very few Serbs that go abroad actually do go back), we were running  5 stores, all of them targeting Serbis living abroad. Another thing that really helped was the fact that I started getting outsourced web development  projects for Dutch, German and US clients. I hired one developer (who is now Price2Spy’s CTO), then a 2nd one, etc - I remember that somewhere in 2008 I wrote my last piece of code, as I figured out I couldn’t keep running the business and doing the actual coding.  In 2008, an idea was born: to build a general-purpose online store for Serbian market, selling consumer electronics, sports equipment, fashion, etc, and that idea became takolako.com - one of the first Serbian Allround eCommerce stores. As TakoLako was growing (in 2010 we already had 10 FTEs), we become aware of the competition undercutting our prices. My first reaction was: “Ok, lets monitor competitor prices, so we can make our own pricing decisions.” The way we started doing it was that each category manager would open an Excel file of his/her own, and on each Monday he/she would check prices of most important products on competitor stores. After only 3 weeks, all category managers wanted to speak to me - they considered the task of competitor price checking utterly dull, and taking so much time. They asked me whether they really had to keep doing it. And that’s when the bell rang - this is something that should be automated. After all, we considered ourselves a software company - we had to be able to do better than this! We started working on a simple tool that would monitor competitor prices for us, and generate alerts when someone dropped their prices below ours. It worked like a charm. Our prices were more competitive, my product managers had more time for creative tasks, and things got so much better. In only 6 months since we started using the tool, we had a 32% increase in sales. This is when I said to myself: “we need to offer this to the world”. It was spring of 2011 - and Price2Spy was born.

176," I went to school to study audio production and engineering, and have been a long time musician, composer, and songwriter. At that time, I started working at some odd jobs, such as waiting tables and pizza delivery, but nothing related to web design or web development. I thought I was going to spend my whole life working in recording studios. Turns out there isn’t much money in that industry, so I saw myself being forced to make a pivot into another passion I later found out, which was designing things for the web. This is how I got into a NY web design agency, where I really brought my hack amateur web skills up to kind of a professional level. I worked there for 3 years before moving to web design freelancing work. I started doing a lot of Wordpress work for clients and built a business called Restaurant Engine, which was a web design service for restaurants and hotels (I later sold that in 2015). Before ProcessKit and for the previous 5 years, I’ve been working on AudienceOps. My work here is what inspired the latest business. I found that existing tools to manage the business weren’t thought for client services and weren’t made for process-driven work. I was constantly duct-taping different tools to make something usable and I got to know other client-service businesses that were doing the same. That’s when I made the click. ",1,0
177," I have a small software development agency working on various projects. For daily operations, I was using standard accounting and project management software. The problem with standard accounting software is that it can’t easily track all of my expenses and profit for every project I needed to filter for it. As I was managing a lot of projects, it became a pain. This was especially true when I gave projects to a contractor and I wanted to make sure they stayed on budget. The idea for Profitabilly was born when I opened my project management software one day. I started to add a task for my upcoming project, and I had a thought to mix project management software with accounting software.  The main idea was simple: You only add a project with a due date, and then you start to log every transaction which would be in the project. For example, billing, contractor payment(s), among others. In the end, the software would calculate all of your costs from each transaction and show your true profit (if any) from the project with all of your specific costs tracked with the corresponding reasoning/task ‍",0,0
178," I got the idea for Pull Reminders at my last job where I was an engineering manager. We had a pretty standard process for code reviews where we’d open pull requests on GitHub and share them in Slack. I remember one time I asked an engineer on my team what was up with a pull request that had been stale for a couple of days. He told me that he had asked someone for a code review multiple times and had gotten tired of nagging. As time went on I started spending a lot of time monitoring open pull requests and pinging people on Slack that needed to take action. I hated spending my time this way but it really helped the team because otherwise pull requests would drag on and take longer to release. When I left that job last December I couldn’t shake away the idea of building a tool to automate what I had been doing. I was also hesitant because I wasn’t sure if anyone else would want to use it. I’ve probably launched over a dozen projects that have failed so my side project graveyard felt big enough. I overcame this fear by doing more research. I asked some of my peers in a “Chicago CTO” Slack group whether they had problems with pull requests dragging on, and many responded yes. I also looked for existing solutions and found a bunch of ""pull request reminder” projects on GitHub that were similar to my idea. This was proof to me that this was not an uncommon problem.",1,0
179," Before diving into QOR360 I spent 25 years as an academic trauma surgeon and another decade doing epidemiology. I didn’t get out much. To be a good surgeon, you need to show up every day, because patients have the reasonable expectation that their surgeon is there to solve any problem that arises, and a problem can come up at any time. So, I spent most of my career on a short leash, never more than 15 minutes away from the hospital. The idea that back pain was a problem worth solving was a personal thing for me. I’d seen many patients complaining about back pain when I was an intern working in the emergency room, of course, and I vaguely understood that Western medicine didn’t have a solution for such patients beyond offering pain medicine and reassurance. So I didn’t take a deep dive into the back pain problem until I developed back pain myself. It took a while to riddle it out, but I eventually became convinced that sitting slumped passively all day long in “ergonomic” office chairs was causing immense problems. And not just with our posture and core strength leading to back pain. Epidemiologists estimate that passive sitting takes two years off our lives by playing havoc with our biochemistry, elevating our bad cholesterol, lowering our good cholesterol, raising our insulin lives. Quite simply, sitting passively is a public health catastrophe.  I should add that I’m not the obvious choice to design a product, create a company, or market furniture. But because someone had to address this problem I dove in. Luckily I found a cohort of like-minded souls with skill sets to make all this possible. It proved easy to find such people because they all understood the urgency of the problem. We created our line of active chairs so people would have an alternative to the terrible “ergonomic” chairs that have come to define the 21st-century workplace. Our goal was to make rock-solid active chairs at an affordable price that were attractive enough that people would want them.    I’m new to the world of entrepreneurship and business, so I don’t have prior failures to fall back on for guidance.  But I do have a long history of team building and teamwork because trauma surgery is a team sport.  So, the business of finding talented people and creating a functional team was something that I had long experience with.  And, as it turns out, this is probably the single most important skill a CEO can have. ‍",1,0
180," QuickHaggle was a community in which online users could exchange their skills. For example, if someone was in need of web designing and in return he could offer proofreading services, a person with similar needs and skills could exchange them with him. Thus, both users could get the service they needed, without paying anything. This was the whole idea of the QuickHaggle.  The Idea is similar to Freelancer, but in Freelancer, you have to offer money to get a service. In QuickHaggle, instead, you didn’t need any capital. Thus, both parties engaging in the trade could save money and still get what they needed. The whole idea was based on the barter system. Just like in old ages when people were trading in commodities instead of money. It was difficult for old ages to find the exact commodity in exchange for the exact one that is needed by the other party. However, today, in the age of the Internet, it is quite easy to find what you need as the whole world is globalized with the web.  ",0,0

182," The idea was born because I own several websites myself but I hate buying backlinks because you can never know what you’ll get and the links may penalize your site. Also, they cost a lot, and who wants to spend money, right? Building links on your own is a pain in the ass because it takes a lot of time and effort to build them. The publicly available backlink lists are outdated, broken, and most of the links don't work. What's most important - you don't get the instructions on what to do to build the link. I’ve never seen anyone doing it, that’s why I thought if I’m building the links myself, I might as well document the process and maybe make some money in the process.  Before I launched Rankd SEO, I already was earning from affiliate marketing and my own info-product sales. In 2018, I launched several info products which have been very successful. I’ve made more than $40,000 with two of my ebooks. I launched the first book in March 2018. It’s been selling now for a year, and while the sales are not as strong as in the beginning, they are still 4-figures a month.

185," The idea for Readership came somewhat slowly. I’ve always loved the Twitter API. It’s completely amazing. It’s like being a fly on the wall of any conversation happening at any time all over the world. And I’ve always loved experimenting with what I could do with the data. For example, I once built an app that could monitor weather in real-time just by watching for people tweeting stuff like “hey, it’s snowing,” What a time to be alive. Readership started as one of those experiments. I was playing with two things - expanding short URLs and extracting domain names from those URLs. I was using my own profile to do this and as I went along I started to notice funny patterns in my behavior. I’m a snowboarder, and I was favoriting a lot of tweets with links to snow-related stuff. Same with parenting. With two little ones, I chuckled at how many things I was favoriting or retweeting or sharing relating to raising kids. Slowly, I realized that I could do the same thing for any account and the potential insights that could glean eventually became the genesis for Readership. ‍",0,0
186," I started a project called ""I Voted Remain"". As you can probably tell from the name, it was linked to Brexit. I'm Belgian and English and I was against Brexit for reasons that are obvious to the fact that I'm very European. I wanted a way of showing that, so I thought the T-shirt business would be an interesting way of doing it. I started a little adventure to understand how dropshipping worked and how I could get an e-commerce platform up and running. I started selling a T-shirt that said ""I had voted Remain"" so that you could wear it loud and proud. But I didn't want to have any stock. I didn't want to have any assets to worry about. That's why I went the whole dropshipping route. I built it with Shopify for the first 30 days and I found it too expensive. After that, I went down the PrestaShop route and that was way too complicated. PrestaShop is a solution that allows you to do an e-commerce platform, but it's open-source, you can install it. It's good, but it takes a lot of time to customize. If you want to get into anything decent you have to spend time customizing the themes. That was such a time suck. ‍  I was looking for a way to reproduce Product Hunt for the AR and VR space. The idea was to create a platform to discover different tools and apps in this space. I still think the problem exists. I used a full code solution that built a Product Hunt clone. You had to host it on your server and code up all the pages and everything to work. I thought it was a lot closer to what I wanted RealityHunt to be. There was a very steep learning curve in terms of coding and getting the result at the time I wanted.",0,0

188," I did the whole nomadic thing in my twenties and didn’t have a permanent home base from 2013 until 2017 when I moved to Scotland to live with my then girlfriend. During that time, I roamed around in Southern Europe and Southeast Asia. I also spent a semester at a university in Morocco. While traveling, I worked as a freelance developer and later started my own WordPress plugin business with a product called WP Pusher. After running WP Pusher on the side for a few years, I started a SaaS in the WordPress space called Branch. I joined the first batch of the TinySeed accelerator and raised a bit of money from some angel investors. The very short version is that Branch ultimately didn’t work out while still having a substantial runway + revenue from WP Pusher. With the runway, I decided to find a new idea and the first idea required me to find a form builder I liked. While researching different form builders, I realized that I didn’t like any of them, and when I talked to my startup friends about it, they felt the same way. I asked the developer I had brought on to work on Branch if he wanted to explore this idea with me as a co-founder, and he said yes. I recently sold both WP Pusher and Branch to extend our runway further.",1,0
189,"  In 2009, I did my engineering in Computer science. While everyone was joining the campus offers from service companies in India, I decided to take a different path.   I joined Freecharge, as their first Product Manager. At an early age, I lead both the Technology and Marketing teams at Freecharge. I worked from scratch to build its first 100k users.   Post-Freecharge, I joined ZipDial, again I was the first PM here. We built the product from scratch. This was an idea which I had independently conceptualized at college. I started as a Product Manager at ZipDial moving to Enterprise sales and into Marketing in my final months. ZipDial was acquired by Twitter.  I had the entrepreneurial quest in me from the beginning. That is one of the main reasons why I did not join a service company right out of college, which most students do. Even though I worked as an employee at Freecharge and ZipDial, being among the early hires gave me the entrepreneurial freedom to build great products.   These experiences were a good learning experience and motivated me to take a plunge into entrepreneurship. After ZipDial, I ventured into my own and founded FindYogi.com. We focused on consumer electronics and built a profitable business with over 2M monthly users.  I met a lot of good freelancers during my course of growing multiple startups but finding them and interacting with them was tough. It looked like a good market to solve problems for. After consulting a lot of established startups, in 2018, I started working on my second and current venture Refrens.com.  Refrens was launched to solve the delay and inefficiency freelancers face when collecting payments from different customers. It is possible to create an invoice within 30 seconds on Refrens. We are trying to build a system around invoicing, not limiting the platform to just invoice creation which by the way is free forever. One can generate quotations/proforma invoices, track expenses, generate TDS/GST Reports.   Along with an invoicing and payments service provider, Refrens is also a marketplace, designed for B2B service providers including designers, software developers, accountants, marketers, consultants, etc. Our focus is on the growth of individual freelancers and agencies.",1,0
190," I have always had an entrepreneurial spirit. I started my first business when I was 12 it was a landscaping and snow removal business that I expanded throughout college and sold it when I was 20. I then studied chemistry so not really related to businesses. Right before starting Rent Nest, I was in finance, trading interest rates on the screen. The idea for this app came from a personal problem. Trying to find an apartment was really difficult because apartments are scattered across many different websites.

191," I created Rent Round based on my own experiences when dealing with letting agents. Whenever the properties I own lost a tenant or a new tenancy agreement was needed, a huge amount of phone calls & web searches were needed to understand what fees & services were on offer.  I thought to myself, I should be able to find a letting agent just like I do with my insurances type in my details and up pops a comparison I can choose from. From that Rent Round was born. My motivation was firstly to fill a need that I was sure other property owners were seeking. Secondly, it was to create something I could creatively be proud of. Over the years I created a few failed ventures, most notably a cosmetic business linked to the fitness industry and a student mentoring platform. I was young and made a lot of mistakes, mainly focusing too much on immediate profit. The soap business was trying to follow the trend of the growing fitness industry. The product itself was based on containing natural ingredients that fight common skin ailments in martial arts and gymnasiums. I was tentative in investing sufficiently in the business. In addition most of the profit I took out of the business, as opposed to reinvesting. I was a lot younger then and didn’t have a financial security blanket to lose a chunk of my savings. The student mentoring platform was based on students paying for a mentor who works in the industry that the student wants a career in. The mentor could then become the students way into the industry if the relationship goes well. The largest issue was the price. The mentors were placing a high value on their time, which the students couldn’t really afford. In addition, students weren’t sold on the idea of paying for a mentor, which actually may not increase their chances of getting their foot in the door. We tried to sell the idea to universities, aiming to get them to foot the bill for their students. We found a lot of barriers to get discussions with the right people and gradually the business lost momentum. Now when I create a business, especially with Rent Round, my primary focus is to create something that adds value & is of high quality. I believe once these deliverables are met, profit follows naturally.  ‍",1,0
192," RepairDesk was conceived out of a need that I felt was prevalent in the repair industry. The idea came to me when I was working with my brother at his cellphone repair shop. We had many repair jobs coming in, a lot of inventory to go through, and needed a system to manage it all. Being an IT-qualified professional, I wanted to solve this issue with technology. So, I got cracking with my idea and started looking for people who could help me out. That's basically how it all started. Thanks to working at my brother's store, I was able to get a fix on what a repair store needed and used that knowledge to build on my idea. Repair jobs assigned needed to be logged, customer records needed to be maintained, inventory had to be kept in check, etc. All I needed was the opportunity to work with a team and develop it. Fortunately, I had already started up a web design company, so I had people who could get things done. I pitched them my idea and we devised a plan on what we needed to do and how to go about it. Before we knew it, we had started work on what would eventually be the first build of RepairDesk. ",1,0

194," In early 2018 I was managing a small digital design studio in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Life was good, but after more than 10 years of only doing client work, my passion for design wasn’t there anymore. I could see the burnout on the horizon, so I knew I needed to do something about it. During my early teens, in the almost prehistoric era of Geocities, I used to spend entire days and nights building Dragon Ball websites instead of playing video games. It was just too much fun! I missed that feeling and I wanted to reconnect with the playful side of being a designer. The problem was that I wanted to build *something*, not just anything, and I couldn't figure out what. One day, my sister asked for help to build her resume and I couldn’t find a straightforward online tool to share with her.  The small group of websites that did do a good job had too many features, which made them unintuitive for the average user. Moreover, many of the paid options forced users to sign-up before even allowing them to test the service, and a few others had dishonest and non-transparent pricing methods. Then the idea came to me: to create ResumeMaker.Online, a WYSIWYG web app that could enable even non-tech-savvy users to design an attractive resume in just minutes. It was a win-win scenario. On the one hand, I could hopefully help people in something as important as their job search. On the other, it was a great way to put my design and coding skills to a test in a challenging and fun personal side project, something I had wanted to do for years.",1,0
195," I used to stream for fun and I also know and watch a lot of streamers. What I’ve noticed about streamers is that despite being great at entertaining their audience, they’re not very good at engaging with their audience. What I mean by that is that when a streamer goes live, they might post about it on social media which is a terrible channel for engagement, and they’ll be lucky if 15% - 20% of their audience sees that. RingDaddy is meant to solve that because text messages have a 95% open rate. SMS marketing is a fairly untapped marketing channel, but it’s incredibly powerful. It’s the difference between streamers re-engaging with 15%-20% of their audience versus 95% of their audience. ‍",0,0
196," Our story starts with Humble Dot, a company that I started with my co-founder in 2017. We raised over $3.1 million in funding over two rounds: the first was a $535k pre-seed round led by Afore Capital, and the second was a $2.6 million seed round led by Susa Ventures (Robinhood). We were on top of the world, our name was starting to get out in VC circles, we had an incredible team of 8, and people were beginning to recognize us. But we failed. Even with funding, we were unable to find product-market fit over three years. We tried every growth tactic and marketing strategy we could come up with, but nothing allowed us to hit the parabolic growth that VCs demanded. We ultimately shut down the company in the middle of 2020 and returned just over a third of our investment money to our investors. My co-founder and I were pretty devastated, but it gave us time to reflect on why Humble Dot was such a complex product to market. One of the main reasons was that we built a product without ever choosing an initial niche or ""wedge"". We directly left our jobs at Twitter and began building an asynchronous communication tool meant for anyone to use. Eventually, we ended up with a tool that did many things well but never really was amazing at one thing for a specific group of people. In the end, we built something and tried to market it instead of doing the market research upfront and making the best product that a market needs. After shutting down Humble Dot, we started with software engineers as our target market. After hundreds of interviews, we found that ""not feeling productive or efficient enough with time at work"" was one of the biggest problems our target market had. We then tested value propositions that would help people with this productivity-focused goal in mind—that is when our path to Rize started.",1,0
197," As I stated, Ropero (literally Wardrobe) was a t-shirt marketplace inspired by Threadless. I started it in 2005 when I was 20 and wanted to do some real business on the web. I had no business plan, no investment, just plain motivation and a few free hours every day. ‍",0,0
198," I started my career in the IT field by introducing Awebstar Technologies in Singapore and grew the company to a great extent. Once a Salon owner approached us for creating their Salon website. As demanded, we have delivered the project at the required time. The Salon owner has discussed the issues they are facing in selling the products and scheduling the appointments online. Considering that, I have decided to look after this matter in-depth. After visiting the nearby Salons and researching, I got to know the loopholes in the beauty industry. Here, my interest in making a solution that can power the salons or spa with a simple yet powerful experience emerged. I intended to provide them a supported system that not only helps them to manage the daily operational tasks but to assure them the highest sales and more footfall. This includes the total eradication of their admin work. And then, knowing all the major requirements of the Salon, I launched Salonist. This is a cloud-based Salon Software with the purpose to satisfy all the challenges faced by Salons every day and improve their brand value.",1,0
199," I started out my career working in a startup based out of Vizag, India called NetSavant. Working at NetSavant gave me the exposure, energy and the entire ‘vibe’ of a startup. This is where I was acquainted with the ups-and-downs of a startup ecosystem. I very soon realized that it resonated with my working style and consciously chose to work with startups. For the next decade, I worked for around 6 different startups- some that made it big, some that didn’t. I believe that my work experience at each one of them shaped me into my entrepreneurial journey.  Looking back, I am glad I chose to work in startups!   Right before Scalefusion, I was working on my first startup- QuadNode, which was founded in the year 2011. At QuadNode, my co-founders and I built three different products with varying degrees of failure. It was a great learning and very humbling experience indeed. As they say, you need to feel and know when it is not working to stop chasing that product and we did just that, when our third product failed to surface the market. During our time at QuadNode, we had spent considerable time studying, experimenting and building Kiosk Technology amongst several other ideas. Kiosk Technology, as I mentioned above is when businesses can take any smartphone, tablet or a laptop and make it run exclusively for business. Think web browsing laptops and tablets in airport lounges, self check-in devices at the airport and hotels, devices displaying audiovisual ads in waiting areas or wayfinders in zoos, museums and shopping malls and devices used in school where students can explore educational apps and nothing more.  ‍ We were deciding which was the one most worth pursuing and needed time, freedom and of course cash to chase our product ideas.  This is when we started out-sourced product development at ProMobi Technologies- the parent company of Scalefusion, to keep the money flowing in and this bought us some time to research more on the one idea that seemed the most promising- Kiosk technology. We offered specialized mobile device management services which also helped us to understand what the market really wanted- we started creating custom kiosk solutions for our clients considering their industry-specific needs and feature-demands. ",1,0
200," One of the first companies I worked for was Palm, back in the days when a PDA meant Personal Digital Assistant, not Public Displays of Affection.  Here’s what mobile email looked like before the iPhone… you used a STYLUS to tap these buttons. I was there for 7 years and, while at Palm, I got two degrees in Political Science, including a Masters at the University of Columbia, Missouri. The idea after getting my Masters was to become a teacher. But, tech was where my heart was. I moved to San Francisco, worked at many failed startups--including one that raised almost 1B and doesn’t exist today. I always joke that I’m either fired or the company shutdowns and it’s about a 50/50 split. Basically, I was both a bad employee and also tired of working for companies that failed. I then joined a YC-backed startup called Zinc. I was their first hire and I had a lot of flexibility to do whatever I wanted. As the first non-founder hire, I helped the company grow from zero to hundreds of thousands per month, which made me realize it was pretty exciting to work at a company with product market fit where I had the flexibility to drive growth and be fully responsible for it. Back in 2014/2015, I started building some products with a friend who was a really good designer and engineer… Zach!  We first built a cool app called Sightings that allowed users:  Take a picture Send a link to someone The other person would get a distance, direction, and a compass Only when they arrived, the photo would unlock! Then we built another app called Pushpin that showed the best places to go nearby based on how great and how far they were. We were getting +100 organic downloads per day, but when we tried to monetize it, no one would pay for it. That’s when we realized that free apps suck. Just after that, we launched Cursive, a tool that created instant small business websites (like this one) with data extracted from APIs. But selling to small businesses was hard. We tried walking into their shops, emailing and calling them, but nothing worked. Then, we tried postcards. We wanted to send personalized postcards but there wasn’t a tool out to do this, so we created one. That’s when we thought “maybe some other businesses would like to send personalized postcards like these”. We spent a few weeks and built v1 of Scout and posted it to Product Hunt. We were the number  #2 product of the day and closed more revenue that day than the year we spent on Cursive. ",1,0
201," Before investing time into Scraper API, I co-founded Fishbole (I am currently still the CTO there too) which is a flipped classroom cloud app for students and educators. It’s exciting because I’ve gotten to manage and coach the engineering team, design the technology stack, and always work closely with the other co-founders to ensure that our mission to build a flipped classroom app with an intuitive layout is realized. Before Fishbole, I worked for multinational companies such as LogMeIn, Dynata, and T-Systems as a manager, leading engineering and product teams. My team and I saw the potential that Scraper API has to do for web developers what Mailchimp does for email marketers, and that’s to streamline a process that can help them succeed in their industry.  ‍",1,0
202," I think we can say that the whole ScrapingBee story actually began almost 3 years ago when Kevin and I decided to build this one fun side project together. I've known Kevin for the last 15 years as we were in the same high school and later in the same university. Early on he introduced me to the whole Startup and Indie Hacking ecosystem by showing me the website and books he loved. This piqued my interest and Kevin and I constantly talked about startup ideas we had. The thing was, we were only talking about or coding some small stuff here and there but we never really launched something. But three years ago, my girlfriend gave me an idea that I found interesting: a product that would allow you to save all the products you are interested in buying online in one place and get a notification once they are on sale. I really loved the idea, as always, I talked about this idea to Kevin and we decide to build it and this time we would not make the same mistakes we made with our previous and unfinished projects: We decided this time to use a boilerplate code so we did not have to deal with code login, email validation, user management, from scratch.We only implemented 2 important features: save the product from everywhere on the web with a Chrome extension and receive a notification once price drops.Even if the results are not perfect, launch anyway. At that time, I was working full time in Paris and Kevin was writing his book about Java web scraping. We built ShopToList in about 1 month, mainly during the weekend and decided to simply post it on three different subreddits and it blew off. I remember that this is 'r/frugalmalefashion', a subreddit dedicated to male fashion discount, that loved our ideas the best, we quickly reached 1000 upvotes and in about 4 hours we had almost 600 users. We were ecstatic, for the first time, we had built something people liked, but more importantly, something people used!  The next week was all about r/posting and some content marketing. We also did a ProductHunt launch that went well, especially considering the state of the app. Quickly we realized that while this app was probably a good idea, making a living out of it would be very difficult, and making a living out of our project was always the goal for us. It would be hard for mainly three reasons: The product needed to be free, so monetization would come from affiliation or ads and both solutions need a huge user base to be profitable. We estimated that we needed at least 100 active users to reach that point with ShopToList.ShopToList is a B2C app and customers are really used to incredibly well-polished app, and ShopToList was not. We knew that in order to build a successful app we would also need to build a mobile app and add many social features.The acquisition is really expensive and hard, especially in the free app B2C market where your marginal revenue per new user is almost 0.Many ShopToList clones existed or used to exist, and it really seemed that only a few of them were making money.   Three months after launch, we decided to put ShopToList on hold. Even if it was not a million-dollar project we considered it a success because it showed us that Kevin and I were both capable of working together and it gave us the confidence to build other products and projects and showing them to the world. Fast forward a few months, out of curiosity we look at ShopToList production database to understand our users. We wanted to know, on average, how many products people added, what was the most famous website... We quickly discovered that out of 3000 users, almost a dozen of them had added around 1000 products each! This was huge, especially considering the fact that we did not offer a way to 'bulk' add products in your account. We went into ""FBI mode"" and understood that those users were actually e-commerce owners who were monitoring their competitor's pricing. EUREKA we though with Kevin, why not build a price monitoring system? This idea seemed really good on paper for many reasons: It is way easier to make money with B2B than B2C.Many price monitoring tools existed, which means that there are consumers for it.Those tools were all very very complicated to use.We could leverage ShopToList users to find our first clients. We did things the usual way, we started with building a landing page, shared it on a dozen Facebook groups. We built an MVP in about 2 months and thanks to a successful PH launch we quickly managed to have 150 users for our free beta. In January, we decided to go out of beta and basically forced our customers to pay for the product if they still wanted to use it. I still perfectly remember that 10 minutes after sending this email, we had our first paying customers. Needless to say, things were looking great. The next following month we would try to get as many users as possible by testing different marketing strategies, mainly content marketing. Our main problem was conversion, it was very very low, approximately 1% (trial -> customer). From day one we knew marketing would be the key and that getting users to our website would be very challenging. But I think one of our mistakes was to overlook how hard it can be to transform a user into customers. We've tried many things to increase the conversion rate, we've rebuilt our onboarding, wrote tons of content, had many many calls and it was just not working. We saw three big reasons for that: We failed to explain the value of price monitoring. We did not know eCommerce very well and I think that this lack of knowledge played a key part in our failure explaining PricingBot value to our users.Onboarding was long and tedious as users had to match their products with their competitors. We offered to do it for a fee but no-one was ready to pay for this, see 1).We never knew who was our target. We never managed to understand what kind of e-commerce needed our tool: Was it a small e-commerce website? Was it drop shippers? Was it a niche website or not? We failed in finding our market. So basically it all came down to our lack of knowledge about e-commerce and e-merchant. In June, we saw that PricingBot would never have the success we hoped it had and we decided to launch something else. And now I’ll finally talk about ScrapingBee. Kevin and I are tech guys, we like to code and to build things. The common denominator of all our previous company work and side projects was web-scraping. We did a lot of it and saw many pain-points that needed to be addressed. Because we used to pay for one and that we were not happy with the product we decided to build an API that would handle headless browser, proxy, and CAPTCHAs for you. We thought it was a good idea because: Web scraping is a really competitive market, if you have doubts about it just type ""web scraping"" in Google and count the number of ads. It was a good sign because it meant there was a lot of demand for it.This time we knew who our customers would be and how to reach them.Because we knew a lot in scraping we had a lot to tell about it and we felt confident in our ability to explain the value of our product to our potential customers.",1,0
203," Before Scream Pretty, I was, and still am, running a successful Jewellery business, Lily Charmed - but the focus of Lily Charmed was on sentimental, gifting charm jewellery and I wanted to flex my designer muscles (Along with my sister Jessica on the left of the photo below), and work on edgier more fashion-led design. This was the inspiration behind Scream Pretty. Before starting in e-commerce, I was a TV and Event Producer - which is a great job - you discover, that with research and hard graft you can become an ‘expert’ in almost anything. I had already tried to start a business. pitching TV show ideas to big Channels in my twenties - turns out they all had ideas ‘just like mine’ in development already! (exhausting) so I decided this wasn’t a business model to continue with. As I’d already tried running a business, setting up another when I had two very small children seemed like a great idea, I could work from home and look after them too. I had a business partner who was already running jewellery shops, so had contacts and knowledge, so starting an online jewellery business seemed an easy step - even though I had NO experience selling online. Sadly, after working for free for two years building and creating a profitable business, Lily Charmed, my business partner decided that he wanted out, and asked for a vast sum of money for me to ‘buy him out’ or split the business (we had created 2 brand names by that point) as I couldn't afford to buy him out - we had to split the business, and I felt very bruised by the whole event. With hindsight though, this backward step, as I saw it then, was the launch-pad to grow Lily Charmed in ways that my previous partner wouldn't (we are now in the largest UK jewellery chain, and exporting to China), and it gave the scope, finances and creative space to launch a brand-new site Scream Pretty. ‍",1,1
204," Since we had to create websites for our businesses and as young professionals didn’t have enough money to cover all the expenses for high-quality services, I studied and handled web design and SEO on my own. It was 2006 and it was a lot easier than nowadays. Later, I founded a SEO agency as a side business venture and was sold in 2015. Believe it or not, from the very beginning of our collaboration with Evgeny we always stashed two or three ideas we could turn into services. Working on a task, we see where and how to optimize or automate a process or how to use knowledge or data we own. With Seomator, I was working on my customers’ websites’ SEO and was wondering how to place SEO Analysis basis rails. As a result, Eugene and I thought why not start a tool that would check and show site owners all the weaknesses of and ways to improve their websites. There are two popular types of SEO Audit Tools on the market right now: SEO Graders such as Woorank, Nibbler, and Mysiteauditor that give you some basic “insides” based on one crawled URL (homepage usually) and SEO Crawlers like Screaming Frog, Deepcrawl, Onpage, and Botify that crawl the whole website and provide results, but usually to figure out something from their reports, you have to understand how SEO works and what you’ll need to do to fix issues.  We are somewhere in between full-scale crawlers and SEO graders we crawl up to 1000 pages from the website and then provide a list of SEO Issues backed with crawl data and detailed information and How-to-Fix tips. What makes us different from our competitors is our absolute focus on the automation of the SEO Audit Reports. We are also proud to be more affordable than most of the other services out there. In 2013, I was working on SEO for a couple of my customers and realized I didn't want to do the same job over and over. I wanted some service to do it for me. I investigated existing tools and found that I wanted something different from them. Tools like SEOptimer, ZadroWeb, or MySiteAuditor provide a quick analysis of your website and give you suggestions on how you can take your SEO up another notch. If you’re looking for something a little more in-depth and technical, without breaking the bank, then Seomator is the right tool. We have Embedded SEO Audit Widget to help SEO Agencies with new sales. Also, you might find a useful Monitoring alert tool to track all changes with a particular website. We offer a free trial you can test out, or you can sign up for a one-time report.",1,0
205," Sharkius was a social games company that I started back in 2007. There were a couple of things that motivated me to start it. I had played many video games throughout my teenage years and always wanted to work in the industry. I was just about to finish my Bachelor's in Computer Science and wanted a head-start. I had made games before university from about the age of 14 some had thousands of users, some had none. Making games, seemed a natural thing to continue doing. Around 2007 Facebook was starting to experience huge growth, and they invited developers onto their platform. I saw this as the perfect opportunity for my indie games to reach a bigger audience.    The problems started a few years down the line. I think my most obvious mistake was the lack of realisation that my experience making good games would not translate well to investing into a team that made good games. Some of the guys I worked with were great people and great developers, but unlike other studios, we were not following a tried and tested formula that could be replicated. We stumbled. Having such game studios was better left to experienced investors with deeper pockets. We grew too fast, too quickly. We did not stay lean. Running a team has so much more complexities than a single person project. I made mistakes in people management, hiring too fast, firing too slow. I made mistakes in project management, and on and on! The inexperience showed at many levels. I was young and over-confident to the extent I was no longer on planet earth. Success had launched me far into space when I needed to keep my feet firmly on the ground. While I do think I got better at the job with time, at the same time, something big was happening. Facebook had grown so much and received so much attention that we were now competing with companies funded with $2-$5M in capital. We had some great ideas, but they had the better execution. Facebook took notice and all of a sudden the platform for engagement and growth became more and more closed. Sudden Facebook changes like closing the notifications channel and reducing feed exposure meant that our traffic dropped to a fraction of what it used to be.  ",0,0
206," Before hacking on a wearable idea to solve smartphone addiction, I studied business in college and worked at several early-stage startups. While pitching that idea at a meetup, I crossed paths with a team working on a mindful phone. Andreas Gala and Jorge Selva met through their partners in Chicago in 2014, connecting over life and business and curiosity about having a more balanced relationship with technology. Jorge had switched to a flip phone on business trips to South America and enjoyed the break from all the noise, while Andreas felt corporate burnout pains in testing lots of smartphones as a product manager at Yahoo.

207," I never cared much about my privacy because, like most people, I have nothing to hide. Last year I watched the Edward Snowden movie (that I strongly recommend) and realized that privacy actually matters and its effect is more concrete than I thought. If we don’t take our privacy seriously, we are going to be manipulated by big companies and politicians. And don’t count on the government to protect our privacy - even if you live in Europe. As a heavy Gmail user, I realized that my Gmail has become my online identity. In order to not be tracked, I need to have as many identities as possible and why not a different identity for each website. SimpleLogin is then created as a solution to easily create a different identity. I have started several adventures in the past but never felt enough motivation or the need to focus 100% of my time. But for SimpleLogin, for the first time several conditions were met: 1) This is a product that I use every day 2) The market potential is big (password managers like Dashlane and 1Password have recently raised more than $100M) - more people care about their privacy 3) It’s technically complex - as a developer, I get bored if there’s no tech challenge. I decided then to quit my job at the time to focus on SimpleLogin. This wasn’t an easy decision: I was leading a software team back then, was well paid, and loved the people there. By that time, I was very impressed by some companies who favor transparency and high ethical standards like Basecamp, Sentry, and Baremetrics, and set out to build SimpleLogin based on these principles.",1,0
208," I’ve been an entrepreneur for almost as long as I can remember. My first business was going around the neighborhood selling rocks that I had found. Later it became bicycle shops and now currently technology startups. This inherent entrepreneurial spirit combined with my interest in business software seemed to make a good combination. While all of these businesses eventually failed at some point, I was convinced that Singulution would be the one that made it. In June of 2017, I left my job at Arista Networks and used my stock options and 401k as a runway for my new venture. When I started Singulution I had no idea that it would eventually fail and be absorbed into another startup called E-DealerDirect, where I am currently Chief Technology Officer. I did not know what I didn’t know and I made many mistakes along the way that fate somehow turned into good fortune. ‍",0,0

Even if that meant quitting a career as an architect —and disappointing my grandma on the way. Working as a freelancer can be lonely, so I started looking for online communities for entrepreneurs and freelancers in Spanish. I rather pay a fee and have an active community and well managed than be free and suffer spam or too much “noise”. I found none that I felt comfortable on. So I created it. ‍",1,0
210," Before Sisu Academy, I was working in the start up sector in Silicon Valley for a “Unicorn”, a billion dollar valued start up in the Human Resource Information Systems realm of business. I excel in partnership development, strategic thinking and in building infrastructures for communications. That’s code for working well with people and understanding how to lay the foundations for effective communication. I’ve also worked in conservative consulting corporations, law firms and and insurance companies. I’ve had a lot of corporate experience so the comfort and stability of a regular job and income was all I knew.  I always had a nagging feeling that I could do so much more and make some positive social change in the world, I just didn't know how and was scared to do so. It wasn’t until I met my husband, a serial entrepreneur, and fellow do-gooder, that we decided to start this new social good venture.  The idea was inspired by my co-founder, my husband. His mom suffered mental health issues, he had an absent father and was raised by his grandparents primarily. We reimagined a school that would offer support for young kids so they had the care and support they needed to succeed. One day we were at a bar in Humboldt, California and on the back of a napkin we imagined what a new school would look like. It included a place to offer a supportive living environment where kids would build their dreams, their businesses. I thought it was too crazy to work. Then I went to work researching it, building the business plan and then poof we started to gain momentum.  ‍",0,1
211," When I left university at 21, I followed a pretty typical developer path. I started in a junior developer role and worked my way up from there. I was a lead developer and eventually served as a CTO before leaving to go full-time to work on SnapShooter. Towards the end of my time in the corporate world, I led a project that included moving some dedicated servers at Rackspace over to the flexible droplets at DigitalOcean. During this project, I did a deep dive into the DigitalOcean API and discovered that I could back up my projects every day for less than DigitalOcean was charging for weekly backups. This lightbulb moment was the push to start to develop the very first version of SnapShooter. Unlike the large software projects, I had led or developed (or even some of the failed SaaS ideas I started to build and abandoned,) making the first version of SnapShooter took just two weeks from idea to working prototype. Since the initial investment was minimal - mostly just a couple of hours every evening -  it made sense to get a website together and get it out there. There wasn’t much to lose in getting users in there and start getting their feedback. I didn’t do a whole bunch of customer acquisition-type activities at first, but it’s grown from that initial launch. Four years later, it’s been amazing to grow the platform, and it’s gone from just backing up DigitalOcean droplets to offering many types of platform, database, server and application backups, even Ubiquity cloud controllers. We’ve spent the time and effort building a fantastic backup engine that’s the core of all our services. We’re really proud of it.",1,0

213," I never meant to make Software Ideas. I’m a full-time software developer. On the side, I launched CoderNotes.io, a website for developers to take technical notes that can be easily searched. While that product got a lot of interest (including landing as #2 product of the day on Product Hunt), today it sits at around $50 MRR. I learned from that project that building something people think is cool is NOT the same thing as building something people want to pay for. I also learned that the market you choose is incredibly important. You want to be in a market where customers are already spending money. I documented everything that I learned from the experience in this IndieHackers post: 5 Lessons Learned from Launching my first SaaS. After that experience, I decided I wanted to take what I’ve learned and apply it to something new, instead of  trying to pivot CoderNotes.io to be something else. So I started doing market research. It started by looking at job boards. After all, if they can afford to hire employees, they must be doing something right! Eventually I learned that there were paid databases of company information that would be far more efficient than going through job boards, but they cost up to $1,000 per year. At that point, the pieces fell into place. I realized that the research I was doing might be valuable to people, and now I had an incentive to try to sell it (so I could make up the cost of the databases).  So, Software Ideas was never meant to be a product - I was just trying to research some SaaS ideas for myself! ‍",1,0
214," I’d always been looking for an opportunity to start something of my own. I worked in a very entrepreneurial role, with the founder of one of the biggest voucher/discount code sites in the UK. My role at the time gave me a lot of freedom to explore new technologies, and come up with new proposals that would add value to the business, however, it was always focused around that business's core focus discounts. I actually left the company shortly before starting Sport Draftr, and moved into a Head of Product & Marketing role at a startup, it involved a lot of early stage marketing strategy, as well as working on the overhaul of their entire website and business model. My co-founder was a friend I had lived with for just over a year (we actually met in the back of a tuk-tuk in Thailand on the way to the full moon party!), but he moved to the US as his girlfriend was there. Fortunately, this turned into a bit of a blessing for us, as it exposed him to the US model of Daily Fantasy Sports. We looked at the Daily Fantasy model that Fanduel and Draftkings had launched in the US and thought this would be great for the UK market. We have a huge gambling industry here, and so combining that with stats and the ability to pick your own team should have been a winner. In the UK, Fantasy Premier League has been the go-to fantasy site for years, but the one big problem a lot of people face with it is that if you miss a week or two, or just have a bad week, you can fall behind so much it kind of gets a bit pointless and people lose interest. We worked hard to build a model that could make any player a potential points scorer. The example we always use is that Michael Carrick (who won everything you can with Manchester United), was always a pointless pick in Fantasy Premier League. He doesn’t score, he doesn’t assist, doesn’t get a clean sheet bonus because he’s not in defense, and so why would you pay to have him on your team? With our model, he scored points for his passes, time in possession, tackles and interceptions that were the mainstay of his game. I’d always been entrepreneurial, I had tested out a couple of different ideas such as a travel site, but always canned them because of high competition, and the requirement for huge amounts of traffic to make the revenue models work. A year or two before Sport Draftr, I was actually in a business development role looking for new markets and new opportunities for the company I was at to expand and generate new revenue streams, so the research and product development areas were already there for me.",0,0
215," Both mine and Amy’s backgrounds are in software development. We both had full-time jobs, which we left to start consulting, which we then left to start our own businesses. In my case, Indy Hall. In Amy’s case, a series of technical eBooks and training and then her first SaaS called Freckle (now Noko). I met Amy in 2007, at a music and film conference called SXSW in Texas. We soon became friends and stayed in touch through the internet as Amy moved to Vienna with her now-husband Thomas. On Christmas 2009, I traveled to Vienna to visit Amy and Thomas. Sitting in the kitchen, Amy and I had a conversation about why our take on business was different from the startup scene of those years. It was 2009, post-recession in America, and there was a lot of enthusiasm and hype for startups and venture capital. But we couldn’t understand why our friends, who had the ability to create stuff, were working for startups (or raising tons of venture capital) instead of selling stuff themselves. That’s when we realized that many of them actually didn’t know how to sell stuff. So we thought that if we started writing about our lessons and experiences building and selling stuff, some of our friends would realize there was an alternative to getting into the startup world. Before Amy and I teamed up, Amy had recently launched her SaaS Freckle and she had been able to get a great number of customers. People were constantly asking her how had she done it so she started selling a three-hour conference call in which she explained the behind-scenes of the business. People found this really valuable and asked her for more information.  That’s when she came to me and told me we needed to teach people who were able to build stuff, help them learn how to start a profitable product business without chasing venture capital .  We first started teaching together on this flagship course originally called “Year of Hustle: Zero to Launch” and later renamed to 30x500. We’ve since launched a constellation of other smaller products all related to the same problem and audience including Amy’s book Just Fucking Ship and my book, The Tiny MBA. All these products and the 30x500 course are part of our business named “Stacking the Bricks”.",1,0
216," The story started in 2015, when we launched a list of Telegram bots, BotFamily.com. In 2 months it grew to 2k/daily visitors, but we decided to put it on hold due to various reasons. Later, we launched Ad-Exchange for Telegram bots, BotRevenue.com. VentureBeat wrote a full article about it. In a few days 300 bot devs. & advertisers signed up. But we found that telegram doesn’t reveal any user data. No targeting was possible! Retention in bots was ~0,5%! We gave it up and switched to Slack. Artem, co-founder of Standuply witnessed problems in Agile teams in his career of a Project Manager. Most of Agile teams need to check-in consistently, adjust processes and work on improving the performance. However, it’s easy said than done. We picked the idea, as we saw the solution. It was in 2016 when the chatbot hype was starting. I was excited about the new opportunities and shared my business ideas with Artem. Together, we envisioned a digital Scrum Master. We started with a Slack bot for standup meeting to solve the main problems of checking-in with remote team members and long meetings. In 2016 in a few days, we got 300 teams signed up having landing page only. Now, thousands of teams use Standuply every working day. ",1,0
217," Before Station I was on both sides of the table: I started an e-commerce platform in Thailand (with my co-founder whom I married 2 years later, my best exit yet!) and worked for a VC firm focused on investing in emerging markets. Ultimately, I found building a company more exciting.  The original version of Station was quite different from the one you can see today. Back 3 years ago my co-founders and I set out to build a browser for work. It was an alternative to traditional browsers like Google Chrome but specifically designed for working with SaaS applications. We grew from 100 beta testers to 40.000+ users in less than 2 years, were elected “Product of the Year” at Product Hunt, went through YCombinator, and raised a $3.25M seed round with Accel in the US. While it all sounds like smooth sailing, we ended up facing a lot of technical challenges (building a browser is hard!) and struggled to find Product-Market Fit with that version of the product (aka retention wasn’t so good). It led us to seriously question our approach and the product we were building.  We looked at hundreds of user interviews, over 2.5 years’ worth of analytics on our product, and every failed feature we had built. We concluded that there were only 2 viable paths for the company: B2C path: while we assumed our users would use Station for work, the vast majority didn’t use it that way. You could see a clear Pareto rule in action there: 70%+ of usage happened in a very small set of chat applications (that include Slack, but also WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram, etc.). Those are not work applications per se. While we thought we had built a browser for work, the reality is we had built a “chat aggregator” for a vast majority of users. If there was an opportunity, it was there: dive deeper and build the best chat aggregator. B2B path: we looked at features we shipped that didn’t work. It’s tempting to just throw them away and move on to the next one. But you can learn a lot from failed features. One such feature was called “Workspaces:” it was like your folders in Google Drive but rather than having files in it, you had links shared across your applications. You could think of it as a collaborative bookmark manager for teams. Individuals liked it (the same way they like bookmarks in the browser) but it never really took off in teams. Why? Because while everyone wants information and knowledge to be nicely organized in a company, it’s the kind of job no one wants to do. The question for us became: what if you could do it automatically? Wouldn’t that be like magic? The B2C path was potentially the easiest one as it didn’t require as many changes to the existing version of the product but we were facing a lot of technical challenges with the stack it was built on.  The B2B path felt more exciting to us. We always wanted to build a product that brings value to entire teams and that makes not only individuals but entire companies more productive. It also felt like this was a real problem we could solve using insights from what we had built before. You know that feeling when you think “Why doesn’t it exist already?”. That was it for us.  While you often hear about “Product-Market Fit”, another equally important concept in my opinion is “Founder-Market Fit” or to which extent you believe to be the right person to solve this problem.

218," My family would probably describe me as someone who had entrepreneurial tendencies from a young age. When I was around 9 or 10 I would buy cupcakes from the supermarket and sell them for six times the price to tourists queuing up for Wimbledon tennis… I like to think my business practice is a little more principled now. Having studied documentary photography at university I found myself with a degree that didn't let me move too far beyond freelance work and soon found myself forming a design agency, which I spent the next five years building. The agencies services naturally evolved and we gained a reputation for UX and digital strategy.  As much as I enjoyed auditing businesses and organizations (the majority of our clients were NGOs and social enterprises), helping them develop their strategy and digital presence, I really wanted to go back to the proverbial cupcake selling. So when one of my clients, a notebook brand called Bookblock offered me to come on board as a partner and Creative Director, my core team and I jumped ship.  Fast forward a few years I find myself in a Michelin kitchen with chef Michael Caines and a client, Eliot. Michael has one prosthetic arm and I noticed that when he was using his notebook on his metal kitchen surface the notebook was sliding around, and it gives me an idea... I mention to Eliot that Bookblock could create a notebook with a magnet at the back which would make it easier not just for Michael to write in, but all chefs.  After an hour of bouncing ideas off each other, we came up with seven unique features the perfect chefs' notebook could contain. One of those features was stone paper, a material made of limestone that is naturally water and greaseproof.  I quickly got some prototypes made up in our workshop and got them out to around 80 respected chefs around the world for feedback. The response was incredible and it was clear early on that the concept had legs. ‍",1,0
219," I competed in track and cross country for all three seasons during my high school and college years. I’m a true running nerd that loves the sport so I always knew I wanted to work in the industry. I bought the domain name StrengthRunning.com in 2007 but I wasn’t sure what I was going to do with it besides “online coaching.” Finally, in 2010 as I was working as a government contractor outside of Washington, DC, I launched the Strength Running blog. I had previously dabbled in e-commerce and affiliate marketing with very little success and knew that I needed to be more passionate about the topic of my business. Now, 11 years later, I’m still just as excited to help runners! ",1,0
220," At first, the goal was to help people with training as I really wanted to work in that field. However, I then started to realize that people’s issues were really around food and nutrition. They didn’t need me to train. They needed me to improve their eating habits. I got sick of watching people suffer and knew I could help, so I dove in. My knowledge about nutrition comes from 15 years of learning on myself, getting certifications, reading lots of books, watching videos, talking with mentors, and things like that. A lot of trial and error on myself as well. I do have to thank those early members for giving me their trust. Without them, we do not exist. At the time I started, there weren’t many people doing something similar online. There were a lot of nutritionists who had traditional offices, but the way we did it was different. We didn’t need to charge what they charged and we didn’t need to have office visits. Everything was virtual.  ‍",1,0
221," I dropped out of College of William & Mary junior year in 2015/2016, joined forces with NFL veteran Steve Weatherford on a fitness training business together. From there was at a VC firm in NYC called Brand New Matter briefly where I came up with the SwagUp concept and decided to go full time on it. I had a bit of a background in branded merchandise in college. A buddy of mine and I wanted to launch an app on campus and in the process needed to get custom flags made. They were super expensive in the US. I was able to find a supplier in China to make them. Ultimately decided to start a side business selling custom flags online. This then expanded into shirts for fraternities and other items. I put that on the back burner after partnering with the NFL player but when I got to the VC firm I realized how invested startups were in brand, employee experience, building community, etc and swag plays a huge role in it all...but there was no great company I could think of as the go-to in the market that made it simple and had a great brand. SwagUp was formed to tackle that initially. One of our first large orders happened to be for a swag pack, an assortment of items bundled up 1 set per new hire and we realized we could build a business around productizing and simplifying that experience that was traditionally very messy. From there it’s been a compounding effect of learning more about customers and the industry and eliminating any of the friction points we see, such as handling inventory, global shipments, design, etc all in one platform. We continue to innovate and look to power the industry as a whole. I’ve always been entrepreneurial. I like coming up with interesting ways to sell things. Swag is not new, but the way we approached selling it and presenting it is. Dropping out of school, I also wanted to prove to people I knew what I was doing and would make it work.  Failure is inevitable. You need to be trying things all of the time, which invariably means you will be failing a lot. I had probably started 15 businesses/ideas before SwagUp, all to varying degrees of success. The more you swing the bat, the more likely you’ll hit the ball. The fun part in business is you don’t strike out after 3 strikes and you only need to be right once.",1,0
222," Every good story starts with some heroes. Those were me, Kasper and Yana: three hot-headed and talented young minds… Almost like by faith each one of us had the right specialty: design, development, and marketing. But, in reality, each of us had more than one role. I consider myself obsessed with visual aesthetics and design. I am 100% emotionally connected with the work I do. I share the belief that only when you have an intimate understanding of the product and audience you can create a design that doesn’t just solve a problem but gets people to feel like a better version of themselves... it’s about the emotional response. My first steps were in photography, learning to appreciate the beauty and to capture it. My educational background, however, took on a different shape. After finishing the Spanish High School in Sofia, I studied in Denmark, finishing a BA in Marketing and Sales. Yana, who at that point was my couple, took the same education. Fast-forwarding to 2013 we were freshly graduated and aggressively unemployed. At that moment in my life, I had developed a keen interest in graphic and motion design, so I thought to myself: “You know what would be awesome? Starting my business selling design and photography services.” So I did it. And yeah, it failed. I  didn’t get any clients, but it was a far more exciting and valuable experience than being on the job market for a marketing position. Yana, instead, took a path into the newly forming startup scene in Aarhus. Startup Weekends were still a thing by that time, so Yana, being an entrepreneur by heart, spearheaded into the event, formed a team and won the award of the jury. At that point, we were not together as a couple anymore, but our friendship persevered. So when one day she called me and told me that her new boyfriend Kasper was in the need of a designer for his startup, I was in. ‍ Wait so Kasper and Yana are boyfriend and girlfriend? More precisely, husband and wife and their son recently turned 1 year. And yes the 3 of us started a company together because that’s what millennials do. Joke aside. When I met Kasper, I fell in love with the guy (like in a platonic manner!). He was sharp, honest and loved Star Wars. What else do you want from a co-founder? Kasper was working on a startup in London, but after failing to get it off the ground, he returned to Aarhus. At that moment I knew that the three of us would create something together. I didn’t know what or how, but I was certain that I wanted to work with them. ‍",0,0
223," How Swoop came to fruition is very personal. My parents immigrated from Iran and started a limousine and party bus company in Los Angeles. From the moment I could crawl I was playing around the office and putting my fingerprints on everything. By the age of three I was handed my first towel and washed a few rims to stay busy. As I got older I gradually became more and more involved in the daily business operations, at an appropriate age of course. Being heavily interested in video gaming and other new technologies that hit the market every holiday season, I quickly noticed my parents’ booking system and operations dashboard were outdated and never got updated. It didn’t strike me as an issue at first, I just figured that’s how things were.  Throughout my college years my friends would always look to me to organize a party bus for them on the weekends because it was a hassle for them to book. They weren’t confident they were getting the best deal unless they visited the lot in person. Over time I saw first hand how the younger generations weren’t attracted to the archaic booking process for limos and party buses but the demand was there. When you set out to build a product, it typically is to solve an issue that you’re fed up with. I teamed up with some of the same friends who were asking me to help them book party buses and we created Swoop. ‍",1,0
224," I was an Air Force C-17 cargo pilot, tasked with flying cargo into war zones. I also grew up building robots with my dad, taught myself coding, and created numerous software projects in the Air Force. I also spent three years learning Arabic and earning a Master’s Degree in Jordan. Around 2013 the Syrian government began using starvation sieges and medical deprivation to break the will of the Syrian people. In 2014 I did research among Syrian refugees in Turkey, and it seemed like every conversation was about the sieges. I couldn’t stop thinking about the problem. It was impossible to fly big cargo planes into Syria’s heavily defended airspace, so I conceived the idea of building an air bridge using large numbers of small drones. I consulted from the beginning with Syrian activists and aid organizations, who saw promise in the idea. We called the effort. ",0,0
225," Before Tactiq, I was working in AI across Europe and the US, focusing on IT productivity solutions. I completed my MBA and founded another startup, TaskPace AI, an AI management assistant for Salesforce users. It helped managers focus their teams on the appropriate activities in their CRM. I lived in Silicon Valley, but TaskPace’s engineering team was based in New Zealand. This meant many remote meetings, where I noticed meeting productivity was correlated to information recorded during the session. At the same time, my co-founder Ksenia was at Atlassian working on team productivity solutions and saw a similar trend. We both experienced the same problems when it came to remote working environments. We observed that meeting productivity is highly related to the amount of information captured during the meeting. Meetings are tremendously more productive if insights aren’t lost. Initially, we thought that a transcription tool could be the solution. It would record and document meeting discussions to ensure no action items or essential insights were forgotten. But as we worked on this solution, we realized that real-time transcription was just scraping the surface of the problem. Beyond capturing critical information, teams needed to be able to extract important details and insights from meetings. The problem space expanded with an epiphany that it wasn’t just about documentation but making post-meeting action seamless. ",1,0
226," I went through a phase of starting a bunch of different products in a short period of time without really seeing any of them through beyond launch. At that time, I was doing freelance web development, but I didn’t want to work for somebody else anymore. And that was when I started to follow some Twitter people, who now represent the Maker community, and found about their philosophy of launching products and trying if they work. Pieter Levels was also launching 12 startups in 12 months, so I decided to try to do the same thing and discovered if it worked for me. If you are a developer, you don’t have big problems creating a new product. But I did have them getting customers for the products. I just wanted something that did well from the launch, so I couldn’t stick with anything. One of the first product I launched was called Targeting Monkey, and allowed marketers and web developers to easily incorporate the user's location and environment into a website, without the need to set up a complex back-end system. By including a CSS file at the top of the pages, this tool allowed marketers to show/hide things depending on the user's environment or incorporate his location inside the company text. Before stating Tailor I had also started Anymail Finder (my first SaaS) and it was doing alright (around $2000/mo) but I didn’t really know how to grow it further. I, therefore, decided to start a bunch of other products. I’m not sure where the idea for Tailor came from, but I knew I’d use something like that. I was probably trying to do some A/B testing for Anymail Finder but found the existing A/B tools a bit too focused on the stats and I didn’t really care about that. I wanted to set a bunch of different options and then trust the system to choose the best one.",0,0
227," As a maker, I love solving problems - especially those of great social impact. A little-known fact about me - I love to write! As I sat down to write one night, I wondered: “why don’t I ever have time to do this?”. After thinking, I came up with a set of three simple answers why:  Content consumption vs. creationLack of time: school and projects consuming most of itInconvenience: sitting down to write is inconvenient. Then it was clear it was a problem I could solve. Using the technical know-how I acquired from previous products, I embarked on my biggest project yet - changing the way people write and updating it to the 21st century. ‍",0,0
228," I grew up in a small town in Wisconsin and was the first person in my family to go to college. I focused on accounting and finance, and my first job out of school was as a CPA. I only lasted a few years as a CPA, and then moved into corporate finance, which I did for a few years as well before going to graduate school, attending Berkeley Haas School of Business and getting my MBA. After my MBA, I did management consulting for a few years, but ultimately went back into corporate finance, which is what I was doing before starting Tali.  As you can see, my career path has been rather meandering and includes a variety of experiences. I always thought that starting a company would be fun, but had no clue how it was actually done. Tali was my first startup, so before starting the company I had no idea how entrepreneurs came up with ideas for their startups. I thought you had to be an engineer, ultimately solving some very difficult problems with a complicated piece of technology. Turns out, I was wrong.  The idea for Tali all started one night in my dining room. My wife is an attorney, so needs to track every six-minute increments of her day in order to appropriately bill her time. She tracks all of her time using pen and paper, and will then spend a few hours each week at our dining room table manually entering this data into her electronic time and billing system. I saw her doing this one evening as I was setting a timer with our newly purchased Amazon Echo, so I randomly threw out the idea “hey, wouldn’t it be great if you could just tell Alexa to track your time for you, and she would turn it into a time entry form?” My wife thought it was a decent idea, so I went out and spoke to as many other attorneys as I could. I learned that they had the same problem around timekeeping, and thought a voice application through Amazon Alexa would be a novel way to solve their problems. After this initial customer discovery, I thought the idea had some weight, so went to form a team around it.  ",0,0
229," End 2019, me and my partner Filip Minev decided to chase our dreams. I was marketing manager at a Digital Product Studio in Belgium and Filip had left Delta, a crypto portfolio app he had built and was acquired by eToro. We wanted to build a product for the rising influencer marketing industry while traveling and working as digital nomads. A couple of years ago, we got the idea when traveling in Mexico, a hotspot for travel influencers and bloggers. Hotspot was going to become a platform that helps hotels to connect with travel influencers and set up collaborations. We were going to build the platform if we could find 100 hotels that showed interest in our idea. We made a landing page and reached out to hotels we found on Instagram. We used a Google form to collect data and weren’t really happy with the way it looked, but we didn’t want to spend too much time on it and moved on. In no time, we found 100 hotels that were interested in our product and noticed most of the traction came from Asia. Beginning 2020, we had a growing number of hotels and influencers on the platform, and we both decided to go for it. I quit my job, we rented out our apartment and booked a plane to Bali, with the first stop in Bangkok. Once we arrived in Bangkok, the pandemic hit and countries were going into lockdown. Customers started churning or asking to pause their subscriptions. Flights were being canceled, and suddenly going to Bali and being stuck on an island with limited healthcare facilities didn’t seem like the safest thing to do. Borders were closing, and to stay in Thailand we had to leave the country to extend our visas, without knowing if we would be able to get back in. We ran out of options and had to fly back to Belgium. We felt like Hotspot could grow and didn’t want to give up on our startup idea so easily. So we decided to keep building and prepare for better days. Fast forward to summer 2020. COVID-19 hit Belgium hard, and hospitals were overwhelmed. We decided to organize a fundraiser and donated free hotel nights to healthcare workers. Again, we needed a form for hotels and healthcare workers to register and we struggled to find the right one. Google Forms is very functional but doesn’t look great, and established form tools like Typeform, Jotform, Formstack make you hit a paywall fast and can be very expensive for early-stage startups or indie makers. By now, we had lost half of our Hotspot customers, and with no perspective on when the travel industry would recover, we decided to pivot and build our own form tool. We wanted to make a simple yet powerful form builder that allows you to create any form without breaking the bank.",1,1

231," My co-founder and I are interested in health behavior change - we previously spent time doing research in molecular biology and behavioral economics - and we knew that many people don't always take the medications they're supposed to (ourselves included!). Over 60% of American adults are supposed to take at least one medication daily, but half of them don't. The common estimate is that medication non-adherence results in up to $300 billion in avoidable health care costs. We talked with professors, conducted surveys on Mechanical Turk, and spoke with individuals who take medications regularly. The more we looked at the problem, the more we felt like there was a gap between the research behind medication adherence and the solutions available in the market. Most people will say they didn't take their meds because they forgot, but that's usually cover for a larger set of underlying reasons (e.g. they don't trust their doctor, aren't sure why they should be taking the meds in the first place, don't have the time or money to fill their prescription). Given that non-adherence is a multi-faceted behavioral problem, we believed we needed to develop interventions that would address each of these challenges. ‍",0,0
232," I thought I could teach English. I didn't have any qualifications. But people would probably want to speak to a native speaker. I had a little bit of success, but I didn't enjoy teaching. I had a bit of experience with SEO and I could build a half-decent website. When I started to get inquiries of people looking for a teacher, I started referring them on to other teachers I knew and I realized there could be a business here. I would refer the leads on and I would get a small referral fee. I built the website out a bit, and I put profiles on there. I started thinking about other cities in Europe like Berlin, Madrid, Barcelona, where people would be looking for teachers. ‍",0,0
233," Even though I’ve launched a few unsuccessful startup initiatives before, Team Voice was my first official one, with a 50/50 co-founder, incorporating, legal, accounting fees, etc. Why did I decide to invest so much time and some money into solving this particular problem? I strongly believe that people spend a huge chunk of their lives at work, and I noticed that lots of people I talked to were unhappy at work. It doesn’t make sense to waste so much time doing something that makes you unhappy. Everybody deserves to live a happier life. Coming from my own experience and noticing the same patterns when talking to my friends and colleagues, I concluded that there is a gap in safe and secure communication between employer and employees. The standard tools (e.g. annual engagement survey) with a bunch of their flaws didn’t work, and there was a need for a tool that opens up this communication channel uncovering what’s broken in the company, so they can act on it before their employees leave. ‍",0,0
234," I envisioned and founded Teamometer as a tool to help teams to perform at a higher level. It came to me because I had experienced my fair share of bad teams and managers, while at the same time participated in a few great ones. Because I worked in leadership and talent development, I had a pretty solid base on what characteristics a high-performance team should have. It was a particularly challenging time for me because I had just moved back to Brazil after 4 years abroad and I kind of didn’t know what I should be doing. I had decided that I didn’t want to work in HR any longer because it was just too bureaucratic. At that point I was reading the Lean Startup, so starting a business seemed within reach. ‍",0,0
235," I have always had a business-oriented mindset. When I was about five years old, my sister and I used to sit on the side of the road selling aluminum foil boats from a cooler for 25 cents each. Even at that age, I wanted to show people that our “product” worked, so I got a cooler and filled it with water, and put the boats on top of the water. If the boat didn’t float, then I would re-create a new one to make sure that it did. We did things like this often. We sold rocks that we painted, boats made from lined notebook paper (those didn’t float!), and then, of course, the aluminum foil boats. We only made about $1. I went to school and received my English degree. While I was in college, I started an Etsy business, and my target market was long-distance relationships. My best-selling product was a long-distance relationship coffee mug. I would paint states on each one, put a heart on the city, and when the mugs were held together, the dotted lines would connect to each location. During this time is when I started to love marketing, as well, and I also realized that I LOVED to be a business owner. I took some online marketing classes, and with a lot of practice, my marketing skills improved. Before shutting down the business, I made almost 2,000 sales in total over three years. I stopped my Etsy business because I had a new idea for a business- real estate marketing. My mother is a real estate agent and she needed some marketing help, so I started posting on all of her social media outlets with content I created through Canva. Many of her friends reached out to her and asked her where she was getting her content from. A lightbulb went off in my head! I contacted each person, set up a monthly plan for them, which was around $450/month, and then I opened up a company called MoRealty Marketing. I would post on my client’s social media every single day, manage comments and followers, create print materials for them, and more. I did this for six years. It was a lot of work for one person to handle. Then, after a while, I started to create open house promos, flyers, videos- people started reaching out to me to create postcards, business cards, and logos. Keller Williams reached out to me to start teaching marketing classes at some of their branches, so I would travel around the Dallas metroplex and teach in front of a big group of agents. There were a lot of positives here, but here is my biggest mistake: I would say “yes” to everyone, and I started to feel overwhelmed. There were only so many people I could take on at once.  I got my idea for The Agent Nest in October of 2019. I wanted to create a program where it would essentially run itself, and a program that allowed an infinite amount of members. Another of the main issues I ran into with Morealty Marketing was that people couldn’t afford the $450/month, so I also wanted to create a company that was more affordable for the average real estate agent, as well. Luckily, my boyfriend is a programmer and also runs his own SaaS, so we had many late-night chats and brainstorming sessions about what we could do to solve these problems: How can I take on more clients?How can I make it affordable?How can I be less overwhelmed?  Once we were able to answer these questions, The Agent Nest was born.",1,1
236," I designed The Blogging Manifesto to complement my former primary blog. I wanted to help my readers with their blogging problems by creating both an eBook and blog to give struggling bloggers a 1-2 punch to work with. The first steps included buying my domain and hosting, spotting a pressing blogging problem and crafting my eBook, blog and subsequent income streams (which I hadn't really thought through) based on this pressing problem. I would publish a video post or article daily to address common blogging issues then I would link to my eBook via a strong call to action. So I dove into writing the eBook, finished it, had my web designer craft a cover and we went life quickly.  ",0,0

I worked for multinational companies in Australia such as ANZ, KPMG, and Western Power. However, I’ve always wanted to start my own business. My wife and business partner is a registered nurse and also has an MBA. Her background as a healthcare worker is one of the reasons we decided to start our own company. We wanted to combine my business background with her industry expertise.  We saw the Australian home care industry was going through large regulatory changes a few years ago. Opportunities were opening up and we wanted to start our own venture. Since we have children, the challenge was giving up the stability of our full-time jobs. It was a risk.

238," The Nerd Cave was supposed to be a new kind of retail model. One that blends community centers, retail and hobby store all into one place. Our focus was on building a truly safe space for gamers of all kinds to come and enjoy their passion and hobby, without the pressure that is generally present in a standard retail store.  The idea was rattling around in my head for many years, but (believe it or not) the idea actually comes from the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle live action film. There is a scene where April O’Niell’s editor’s kid heads to the foot clans city hideout. When he arrives, he is greeted into a massive space where kids are playing arcade games, gambling, skateboarding and more. My plan was to make that place a reality, minus the gambling, drinking, and smoking… and foot clan.  Our plan was to approach it slowly and build the play space rather than being purely focused on retail. We were always working with key people in the community to facilitate events and make The Cave the most desirable location to run games/events.  ",0,0
239," Our motivation was to cover a missing solution in the market. Considering the gap, we identified, we had little doubts that we would face any difficulty (first error!). As my wife shared the real passion for the sector, she was in charge of the main operations of the whole business. Instead, I was the marketer and the logistics in charge (which was the backbone of the whole business). Prior to TPK, I had held numerous positions within the corporate sector either as head of sales, marketing, or business development. But in either consumer or healthcare sectors, I did not ever have anything to do with F&B. I had little clue on what kind of challenges we would be facing there. ‍",0,0
240," I saw the Launchpad iOS app that allows people to create music. As I tried it, I saw an interesting pattern – even if I close my eyes and just tap the tiles in the app randomly, a pretty listenable music was coming out. I love and collect great graphic design examples and websites, but I always thought that you need to be talented to create a website that would be this good. But what if I could design great, modern website blocks and allow people to create websites with them, just like what Launchpad app does with pre-recorded samples? No matter if you are talented or not, just a random sequence of such blocks would come out as a modern website with a striking design. I saw the success of Designmodo as they did the same thing, but I wanted to do this differently. Instead of focusing on conventional design trends that would appeal to the general public, I wanted to focus on freelancers and design geeks who seem to prefer a more modern, unconventional, experimental design. This is already a huge trend in the graphic design community led by freelancers you can see on Awwwards and Instagram. Experimental typefaces, glittery 3D-models, visual glitches, and overall modernism – right there, at your fingertips. Thepresence should’ve been just that, allowing you to build a website just like those which you saw and liked but never knew how to design. ‍",0,0
241," I’m a tech guy, with more than 10 years in the web and mobile development industry. I mostly worked in backend engineering, architecture, and technical leading areas. A few years ago, after failing with a game development company, I gathered interest in analytics and data-driving decisions. The reason was that the biggest mistake we made in building the game development business was a lack of experience in game analytics. A few months ago, right after the whole world had been locked in their apartments, I decided to spend some time on new ideas. A question was resonating in my head: ""How do marketers search for trends and measure their success on TikTok?"". I then decided to pursue this idea. ‍",0,0
242," Toygaroo was an exciting twist on the “rental” phenomenon - we called ourselves the Netflix of toys. People would sign up for a “toy box” subscription and pick how many toys - 2, 3, 5, whatever the subscription level was. They could have x number of toys out at a time. If they returned one we’d send a new toy from their list. That way there could be a near constant stream of toys coming into the house. And if the kids really loved a toy they could buy from us. The company was founded by a great group of people based in Los Angeles. They had good marketing experience, but needed the software. I came in, licensing the Filmamora software to them and modifying it as needed - which essentially turned into a re-write of the code. ‍",0,0
243," I’ve always been an entrepreneur. As a kid, I was a student of a private school, and hanging out with kids that received money from their parents. In order to have the same level of life than them and not be left behind, I would find out what students would need, and just make it happen! Before my work on Trackin, I was CTO of another catering company. One of our main pain points was the delivery and find out where the food was. It really makes you look bad to not be able to answer such question when the order size is worth $1k+. I quickly realized that it was a worldwide problem. Even the big brands like Pizza Hut didn’t know what was going on with their drivers as soon as they left a restaurant. I looked up online and didn’t find any technology to streamline deliveries, so I just went ahead, quit my job, my visa, my girlfriend, and life in San Francisco. I went back to France and started to work on the tech! Then long story short, I showed it around the world to different restaurants after a few months and an MVP, then I launched it, got some interesting growth and joined Y-Combinator.  Being half French and half Italian, I really care about food, and I couldn’t keep seeing people having bad experiences towards it. It definitely made sense to come up with technology so that people stop being scared to order food online and wait for hours without any news from the restaurant. Also, as a people person, I do care a lot about user experience and making people happy. With MobyDish, it is the perfect opportunity to have a huge impact on the food space and to connect people together, the right way. The idea is not just to feed people but to create such a great and easy experience, that we’ll democratize catering like Airbnb democratized renting apartments from individuals, globally. ‍",1,0
244," I believe entrepreneurs and startups with unique ideas deserve access to the best growth marketers available. My passion is working with small startups led by diverse founders who are solving problems others aren’t really thinking about.  And, I think the traditional agency model is crap. I was tired of seeing startups set back a year because they hired an agency (or in-house hire) that wasted their time and money with sloppy execution. So, I started to freelance. I got my first client (a partner we’re still working with today!), from a marketing agency that was over capacity and needed to find a home for a smaller client. They knew I could run Google campaigns and let me run with it.  The transition from freelancer to founder was a slow one and I had a lot to learn. Being out on my own was easy and I felt confident as a one-person team. I didn’t have much overhead, I could travel, work on my time and schedule, deliver results fast, and pick and choose who I worked with. But after about a year I knew I wanted something bigger and more meaningful with a group of smart and talented people, which is why we now have Tuff.  Before Tuff, I was a Head of Growth & Marketing for Uppercase, and previously on the marketing teams at Adaptly (acquired by Accenture) and Nielsen.  ‍",1,1
245," Up until a year ago, I was working in a product position at a startup. My former co-founder Tibo (who I had built a startup with a few years ago) reached out to me. This informal “how are you doing” conversation led to me quitting my job and going back to full-time entrepreneurship within a few weeks. We had no product idea. But we had a problem in mind: how can we help other makers find users for their products? We thought the best way to solve this was to actually confront ourselves with the problem. So we made a bunch of products that took a few days to build, and we launched them. After a while, I realized Tibo was bringing in a few new customers very early after launch, thanks to his decently followed Twitter account. I thought: “Man, I’m the marketing guy and he’s bringing the users, that sucks, I have to start tweeting”. So I did. And I was terrible at it. It turns out we had a tweet database that we had been using for another project, and we thought we could turn that into a product that could inspire people for their own tweets. So we made it. I used it. And immediately, I got better at tweeting and spent a lot less doing so. This is how it all started. ‍",1,0
246," As enthusiastic Twitch viewers with families and a full-time job as developers, we couldn’t watch all the full streams as they are very long (~8 Hours), but we didn’t want to miss it entirely, so we took inspiration from sports, mostly NBA. Shortly after each NBA game a highlights video with the most interesting moments of the game was available on the NBA website. We have tried to build many things over the years and we thought that we need to go “all-in” on Twitch Highlights for it to succeed. We quit our jobs and start working on it every day. Our business model was simple, streamers will use Twitch Highlights in order to generate highlights videos out of their raw streams, and by doing so they will increase their overall viewers number. The equation was pretty clear to us, as a streamer “more viewers” = “more revenue” so as long as we will help the streamers make more money they will be willing to pay for Twitch Highlights monthly subscription.",0,0
247," Idea picking is the hardest thing: you are afraid to invest time and money in a pointless project. I understand this fear 🙌 I believe the only true way to pick an idea which you will be able to carry on for years is to follow your heart. What do you truly love? Traveling, databases, bikes, cats, websites, music? Pick an industry first. If you do not know, perhaps you need to start becoming interested in a wider range of things: make new connections, visit local events, try something new.  Keep being curious and you will notice real problems to solve. Then just do some customer development to validate your ideas. I simply did this: started being interested in coding and fell in love with the websites 🥰  I started my career as a web developer in 2014. After 100 created websites every web developer starts to think about making their own website builder. There is nothing romantic about finding this idea 😅 The problem is to get confidence and quit the job to follow the dream. It took me 2 years working as a web developer and 2 years of working as an  entrepreneur to get to the point where I could say “I can do it!”. After gaining enough experience, wisdom and confidence I decided to quit my current job position and build the product. I remember that moment very well: a crystal clear understanding of what and how should be done. I’m sorry for saying it like this is an easy-peasy question. This is definitely not.  Idea picking is hard and requires diligence and luck. Let me know if you have problems with ideas. Perhaps I can help or at least show you my ideas list to give some inspiration. ‍",1,0
248," Just before Uptrend Consulting, I was studying for my degree. I was also actively involved as a student-athlete for the Singapore weightlifting team.  I enjoyed the “grind” of having to balance school and sports, which gave me a sense of purpose. But once school was over, I was stuck in this vacuum of time wondering what I really wanted in life.  This was about 4 months prior to enlistment. That was the “oh shit” moment when reality hit me. Lifting weights wasn’t a feasible option during the 2 years of service, neither was it after. I set down and thought real hard about it, and came to the conclusion that financial stability and freedom was what I truly wanted.  So I decided to drop the sport of weightlifting and dedicated the 2 years’ downtime to focus on building a business and fixing my injuries (2 shoulder surgeries).  I had to start from scratch as I didn’t have any skills at all. Uptrend Consulting was largely failed experiment of constant pivoting to find a market fit. ‍",0,0
249," So, back in early 2018, my team and I were growing with a previous SaaS product. That SaaS startup was doing over $1,000,000 ARR. And with that growth in users, the amount of feedback was increasing as well. Back then, we were documenting feedback in a spreadsheet, but at one point, this wasn’t sustainable anymore. When researching other user feedback tools, I quickly noticed an opportunity to build one of my own. I thought of making a new product instead of using existing ones because I wasn’t fulfilled anymore working on the product we were working on. Although we had created a fantastic product, I wasn’t passionate enough about the market we were serving and decided to sell it. This also became one of my biggest lessons learned: If you’re not passionate enough about solving your customer’s problems, it’s not going to work in the long run. ‍",1,0
250," Back in 2008—when I was a 16-year old kid, with no sense of direction—I was looking for a study. Music seemed like the most natural path but I wasn’t confident enough nor did I have the skills yet. I decided to study web design. One of my teachers introduced me to HTML, CSS and eventually WordPress. I was sold. Long story short, I failed that study twice (yes, twice) and called it quits after two years. I felt miserable and my parents were disappointed… perhaps college wasn’t for me. ‍ I decided to quit I've always enjoyed working and getting my hands dirty. I got my first job when I was 13 years old, delivering a weekly paper where I made about $6 per 500 deliveries. Awful! But hey, I was young and it paid for gaming, clothes etc. Anyhoo, I decided to quit school in 2010 and work in a restaurant whilst I figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Between shifts, I had a lot of time to think and on the off-days I was making more music than ever before. After years of no contact, I got back in touch with Robin in 2011 and it turned out he was producing the same style of music (and even selling it online). The fact that he was actually making money online and that it was a side-business blew me away. And this was my first proper introduction to online marketing and selling digital products. ‍ Takeoff Three years later, I took a leap of faith and auditioned for the Herman Brood Academy, a well-known music school in the Netherlands. I didn't think I was good enough, but I got it in 😮! During my second year at HBA, I couldn't stop consuming content and thinking about marketing. After I graduated the Herman Brood Academy in 2016 I started working full-time as a waiter. On the side, I did some web design at Heroic Academy—a course platform and blog for electronic music producers. Eventually, that led me to join the Heroic Academy team full time and later on become Head of Marketing. Budi Voogt and Tim van Doorne—the co-founders of Heroic—taught me a lot about online marketing, management, and transparency. And here's where all the pieces came together. Years later, and Robin and I were still talking every day. About our side projects, marketing ideas and so on. As I said earlier, every time an artist joined Robin's email list, he or she will get an automated survey. This allowed him to get a ton of data from artists. As you can see the majority struggled with mixing, recording, and songwriting. The more we thought about it, the more sense it made to create a course for Hip-Hop and R&B artists and launch it on a new website. We were looking to partner up for a long time, and this was the perfect timing. In the summer of 2017, project Urban Masterclass was born 🎉! We wanted the name to be as self-explanatory and as flexible as possible. And cater to both artists and producers. I guess I've always carried the entrepreneurial bug, but these life events made it crawl out of its cave. In December 2017, Heroic Academy and I parted ways because I wanted to grow Urban Masterclass and focus on freelancing.",1,0
251," Before starting Vacation Bird I was spending all of my time on affiliate marketing. I did fairly well promoting other people’s products but you end up on a hamster wheel where the harder you work the more you enrich other people. This made me want to create something of my own. When my promotional methods were killed off completely by the platforms I used to promote, this was the final nail in the coffin and a signal for me to shift to something new. I could have found new ways to stay in the affiliate marketing industry but by that time I had lost all motivation and desire to continue. ‍ Double Trouble At the time, I had a partner in crime - a friend with whom I tagged along for pretty much every new project or endeavor. We’d always scheme together on what to work on next. We were friends from high school and at one-time roommates before going our separate ways.  I don’t know if there were any particular reasons why we thought a vacation rental website would be great other than the fact that once you got it going it could have huge potential. In late 2011, the biggest vacation rental industry players were VRBO and VacationRentals.com.  We poked around to see if there is room for another player and thought we saw an opening. After all, we were both great at SEO and the plan was to get the site SEO’ed out and indexed quickly for organic traffic.  This was not a terrible plan considering we both ran multiple websites in the past that did well with organic SEO traffic. We thought we’d translate that experience into something bigger, more ambitious, and more fun. I had some savings from my previous endeavors in affiliate marketing and decided to take a risk and try something bigger. The only trouble was that both of us were non-technical co-founders which would mean we’d need to hire out development - a costly activity.",0,0
252," In some ways, startups live or die by their ability to tell their story clearly. And not just their story, but how they provide differentiated value. It’s somewhat of a need when it comes to startup success. It seemed relevant to me if a group of creatives could focus on this particular niche, that there was a business.  Whilst more and more startups were appearing, video was also dominating the online media landscape. It’s truer today than it was five years ago, and I think COVID played its part in accelerating video’s adoption for both businesses and consumers.  Whilst in retrospect we could have been a broader agency and included UI, brand, and the whole works, I’m really glad we specialized in video, as it allowed us to focus on our internal processes in a way that reflected externally through an excellent client experience. I was studying communications and film at RMIT, which is also where the confidence in heading into a video career came from. I was also working at a Mexican restaurant that served great tacos. This was super important, as I’m convinced that there is some kind of advantage to a founder/someone in business development who has worked in hospitality for an extended period you have to think quick, talk quick, and get drilled on the difference between good and terrible service. I wanted to travel more but found that hard to balance with giving a meaningful effort to starting Vidico. I admire people that can do that, but I’m not one of them. My co-founder and brother Evan also studied film and scriptwriting. We always had a love for the movies and got heavily interested in the idea of startups during our last year of university. The idea came from a web-series that we both produced it wasn’t a startup, but it was a project. Learning: start with a project first, and if 3-5 people tell you you’re onto something without tilting their opinion, I’d take particular notice and double down on your efforts. I’m a person that values independence, and also someone that didn’t see themselves fitting well in a corporate environment. I’ve had experiences in previous jobs where people just didn’t want to try ideas if you put them forward. Vidico has grown on the exact opposite foundation our team is part of an environment where if they want to try something new, Evan and I will back it 9 times out of 10.  It’s hard to do this in larger organizations where the decision-making process is too hierarchical and matrixed.  Lastly, there was also disruptive reasoning: I consider the traditional advertising agencies to be heavily overcharging their clients. This meant that a tonne of startups simply couldn’t meaningfully participate in having a high-quality video, and that just didn’t seem right to us. I had an idea for a travel app called Myway, that allowed 1:1 tours with locals. Got the app to the prototyping stage with Evan and the timing was good. But the wider team wasn’t right, and our momentum got stalled with Vidico (then Lunamik) getting traction. Airbnb Experiences then launched some years later, and I watched several startups get high valuations based on the business model. That’s the difference between having a concept and being able to meaningfully execute. All things considered, a travel business would have been a nightmare to run in the COVID era, so it all worked out in the end. Also had an idea called Menyu. Digital and physical menus. Got as far as designing the website, but Vidico got even more traction to the point where it just had to be our only focus. Later Mr.Yum and HungryHungry emerged, which did sort of validate our framing of the problem. ",1,0
253," I dreamt of becoming an entrepreneur while working in Investment Banking, but I had no idea where to start or what to create. Ultimately it was serendipitous. Given my investment experience, friends asked me to help raise funds for their venture. When I had accomplished this, I was invited to join the project and become the COO/CEO. I knew nothing about how to build a start-up I didn’t even know the meaning of the word! But I was inspired by the fact that I would be responsible for all the decisions I made. I used to be a professional tennis player when I was a kid and I see building a company as being remarkably similar. You learn to become a better version of yourself every day, you constantly discover new things and practice a lot, you grind away to overcome obstacles, and face a lot of challenges. On the other hand, there is travel to different places, building new connections, and a great sense of enjoyment and accomplishment. For those reasons I quickly fell in love with my new professional role. I bought a one-way ticket and moved to New York City as it was clear to me that The Big Apple is the capital of advertising and media. The first project I was involved in as a co-founder expanded into three continents in the first year, but it swiftly became obvious that it wasn’t scalable. I was disappointed, frustrated, and despondent as I did not want to return to working for a corporate, having experienced and loved the creative freedom of being a founder. Working on the first project, Profit Button – a new type of rich-media ad solution – we lost contracts because we didn’t have sufficient production capacity. I started to explore this niche and realized that it is a bottleneck for many brands and ad agencies.  That’s how we ended up developing Viewst, a cloud-based solution to scale digital ad production. One of the reasons Profit Button failed was that we didn’t do the research and we developed a technology that didn’t solve a crucial market problem. Viewst is different. Together with the team, we have learned how to talk to our users and prioritize the roadmap, how to save funds on infrastructure, and how to be agile and quickly and easily adapt to market changes. This enabled us to overcome COVID-19 challenges, save the team, and scale Viewst’s user growth. ‍",1,1
254," My co-founder, Mike, and I met in college at Berkeley. We got along immediately and ended up scheduling the same computer science classes every semester to be project partners.  After graduation, we started hacking nights and weekends on interesting ideas while he was at Microsoft and I was at Twitter, which led us to start two companies before Vimcal.  The first was banner ads for augmented reality. App developers could install our SDK into their AR app, and when their users pointed the camera at a wall or floor, there’d be a Coke ad there.  We then pivoted to the fitness space and created an app that helped you improve posture - think Headspace for people who hunch over their computers all day. We consulted yoga gurus, hired instructors to teach foam rolling classes at tech companies, and studied other successful fitness apps to learn about the space. Ultimately, we found that fitness apps required too much marketing for our comfort (and lack of money in the bank). We first came up with the idea for Vimcal while fundraising for the fitness startup. Almost overnight, we started needing to schedule 30+ investor meetings every week. As much as we loved using Calendly, sending just a URL to an investor came off as rude. We had no choice but to coordinate what times we sent to who manually. Mix in Asian and European time zones, and the result was a bunch of embarrassing double bookings, “oops, that time is taken”, and accidental 4 am calls. The tools supposed to help us got in our way, so we decided to pivot and build our own as any maker would do!",1,0
255," My NYU background is in digital animation and graphic design. When HTML 1.0 surged in 1995, I jumped into it fast, and within a few weeks, it got me the dubious title of “Mr.Internet” at Doremus, a banking agency in NYC. It was a very exciting time to work in technology. In 2006, after working all over Silicon Alley, I co-launched Design2Dev, an “agile digital agency”, along with a very talented tech partner who at the time was one of the most talented flash devs I’ve ever met. While there, I came up with our first SaaS idea to provide modern portfolio solutions for creative professionals. It was a flash-based application and there was nothing high-end out there at the time, so we thought we could make a decent offering. It took us more than 1.5 years to launch the product. We were both perfectionists and we were always wanting to add more features, instead of releasing something quickly and validate our idea. By the time we launched, Flash was already dying out fast! The timing was horrible and we sadly had to shut down the business. If you can’t beat them .. join them!Having all this Flash know-how helped us figure out a way to opportunistically take advantage of the tech-void Flash left behind. So we built a productized service called ConvertMyFlash, which semi-auto-converted Flash websites into WordPress themes... in just 72 hours. On the outside looked like a fully automated product, but on the backend, it was my agile dev team that performed semi-automated actions to quickly create these custom WP themes. We had decent success for more than a year, and the most important part was that I proved to myself that I could pivot and find success much faster. One year later, I was losing that burst of inspiration. The business was essentially becoming a tedious factory-style process..and our market-window for this service was closing. So this time I decided to jump into a completely different idea..something closer to my heart... ART. This led me to build a social-marketplace called Juicy Canvas, which was a very new way for people to consume art and even design their own lifestyle products (read our manifesto). We got into an accelerator called Startup Chile and had some early success. Sadly two years later, we decided to pivot, as we ran out of runway and there were too many mega-large embedded competitors fighting for the same consumers. The new product we created was called Pop Team and it was an on-demand service we provide to companies who wanted to celebrate their team while sprucing up their boring office decor. This idea had enormous success as we managed to validate it in just 1 week!.This simple solution killed 2 birds at once. It creatively demonstrated that the CEO cared about their team while sprucing up the office/team vibe, matching any decor they had.Our main acquisition channel was mostly email and Instagram which performed really well at a very low cost. Two years later, my cofounder and wife fired me as the CEO and she felt more confident and empowered to run the business her way. It was a smart move, as it made our relationship a lot easier. This liberation gave me enough time to work on new products and my agency, https://Design2Dev.com. While working with clients there, I kept having to create visual sitemaps which took up a lot of my precious time..so we decided to automate this manual process, as it was how VisualSitemaps’ idea came up and the business was born.",1,0
256," The idea of Vivalatina rose when my Mexican wife moved to France to live with me, in 2010. We wanted to set up an e-Commerce to sell Mexican sterling silver jewelry that we would import from Taxco and resell in France. I had lived a while in Mexico so I had lots of contacts in Taxco to source the jewelry. Moreover, as my wife could not work in France (her medical degree was not approved by French authorities), this was a big opportunity for her to make a living. However, living in France we almost didn't try to turn our idea into a real product as I was very busy with my full-time job, and my wife was trying to work in the health sector while selling Mexican jewelry through eBay. It was when we moved to Mexico in 2012, to a town with no industry and where we didn't know anyone, when I decided to give a try to this business idea we had in France and put all my efforts to succeed with it. At these times, the idea had changed a bit. I wanted to find some local sterling silver providers and make an e-Commerce that would sell Mexican jewelry to France. My selling argument was the low price I could offer. The plan was to run the business alone, doing it all by myself: finding providers, taking pictures, managing the web, and marketing the site. I wanted to cut costs and offer really good prices, as this was my main advantage. ‍",0,0
257," I’m big into my sports and helping out charities raising funds where I can.  A local lads and girls club had a team that were rowing the Atlantic Ocean from Europe to Antigua and I ended up being part of the team.  During the training for the event, we were entered into Ironman UK which is a 1.2-mile open water swim, 112-mile bike ride and then a 26.2-mile marathon run at the end.  Whilst training it became abundantly clear there was no-one catering to the market properly from a design point of view. Every Triathlon suit seemed to be one color and most often they were just black. Pretty boring for a sport which took so much out of you.  I knew of the process of sublimation printing into man-made fabrics so I went about trying to source this in the sports I was constantly training for.  Before I started VO2 Sportswear I had started and grown a very successful business telecommunications company called Comms Consult. It was through the connections I made building this company that the opportunity to row came.  I was always on the hunt for things that mixed my passion for sports, charity, and business together.  The brand was started whilst I was still running the Telecoms company but things took their toll on my relationship with my co-founder and after a falling out we decided to go our separate ways. I then sold my half of that business to him and took on the challenge of growing VO2.  I was only 26, I had a lovely apartment and a brand new 370Z on the drive. Living a pretty cool lifestyle for a young age. In hindsight, I had a lot too young probably as it made me very overconfident in my ability. ‍",0,0

259," I guess I can say this project related to my personal situation to some extent. I’ve left my 9 to 5 job and wanted to take a small break to see if I could potentially work remotely with companies/projects I believe in, rather the moving my things from one city/country to another. At a time (it was mid-2017) I saw a niche, which wasn’t quite covered by recruiting agencies and various job listing boards I’ve seen around. It was never a competitor of RemoteOk nor was it similar to Freelancer/Elance portal. The initial plan was to spin it up as a job listing board, where real companies (not agencies) would post an actual remote & permanent position for a small fee of $99 for 30 days. From there it was supposed to be a one stop shop for screening/testing and final offer service to keep it all in one place. It was my first try in business and I was very motivated to make it happen. ‍",0,0
260," Waterproof Digital Camera Blog was one of the more successful side-projects I’ve started prior ProteusThemes. Until it wasn’t, as we’ll see a little bit later on. Since I was 13 I was very interested in photography. Then in 2011 I attended the diving school and obtained a scuba diving license. So, I thought maybe I should try and level-up my skills in underwater photography. The underwater housings for the DSLR cameras were way too expensive for me, but a new range of cameras arrived in the market at that time - compact waterproof digital cameras. I started doing some research on which one I’d like to buy and there were no good reviews of these cameras out there back then. None of the online resources focused specifically on waterproof cameras. This is when it clicked in my mind - maybe I should start one? I’ve been freelancing for years at that time so spinning up a new WordPress blog was easy for me. I registered a domain name waterproofdigitalcamerablog.com and started writing “dry” reviews, with all the information I was able to find online about these cameras. I even started a Facebook page back then to start a community around the topic. I was so excited when I started getting visitors and also the Facebook page started getting some organic likes.  The idea was to have the reviews and list of all the waterproof cameras under $1,000 available on the market. ‍",0,0
261," Any ideas I have tend to be the sort of ideas a software developer can have because that’s who I am. Those tend to have a lot of competition and generally good competition. I wanted to work on those niches that you’ve never heard of. Those can be a gold mine, a consistent gold mine. At the same time Jules, a friend of a friend was searching for a CTO to build his idea. I’ve never met him before, but he pitched Watu to me and I was immediately sold. Before starting Watu, Jules was running several staffing agencies of various kinds and was very well connected and respected in the industry. This ended up being a bit of a challenge because other staffing companies didn’t want to share their private books with us, but eventually, they understood we weren’t trying to steal their customers. He also commissioned various applications built for his own company which gave him experience in what an app like Watu was supposed to do. ‍",0,0
262," My first job out of college after studying communications was with a large software company in Charleston answering Tier 1 support calls. We supported an enterprise CRM product for non-profits. Then I moved into sales as an early employee at a local startup (also in non-profit tech), so most of my background is in support & sales/marketing.  I was pretty lucky to have opportunities in tech and work with a growing startup to learn skills. The support job taught me how to work with existing customers and how to listen properly to help them solve a problem. As a sales-engineer, I was able to work between the sales & engineering team to help them with demos, scopes, technical evaluations, etc.,  I got married in January 2015 and in February, I told my wife I wanted to quit my job and start a company. It was the first she had heard of this 😬😬 I kept telling her about all my ideas and she finally forced me to meetup with one of her close friend’s husband, Nick, who was also driving his wife crazy. We were both getting the entrepreneurial itch. Our wives got tired of hearing all about our ideas and forced us to go get coffee and talk to each other about them.  We started in 2015 with an attempt to build a new kind of social network. One where you followed radio shows, podcasts, topics, and other subjects and verbally talked with other fans about them instead of typing. Think Reddit crossed with audio & Twitter.  Long story short, we launched the product in 2015. It took on a few different iterations as we pivoted around looking for product market fit. We found it with consumers but never actually built a business around it.  I had already left my job and was working on this full time hoping to raise money, which never happened. Trying to simultaneously bootstrap the product, gain initial traction, and fundraise was really stressful. It felt like we were grasping for straws with any partnership we could find or feature we could build. We lost about 2 years of our time and $30k of my savings (which was most of it).  We held on to the dream way too long. We kept chasing the next feature, the next business model idea, the next big partnership, etc., until we ran out of time & money.  ",1,0
263," I’m a non-technical manager and for the last ten years, I have been struggling to stay in sync with the progress that my engineering team is making. Because of this, I've created Waydev, for helping managers like me have better visibility in the development progress. What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)? Code management is now in the cloud on Github, Gitlab, Azure DevOps or Bitbucket. Now it is possible to track the engineering team output. At this moment, most of the technology companies look at reports created with manual input from the engineers, but if an engineer didn’t log the work in the report, it's inefficient and often not accurate. With Waydev we’ve done the mistake of targeting the wrong target, the non-technical managers until the end of 2018 when we switch our target to technical managers and managed to have our first paying customers. We’ve launched the new product in January, and are rapidly iterating based on users feedback. With this change, most of the users started giving us feedback and managed to build features based on their feedback.",1,0
264," I was involved quite heavily in planning my own wedding and as an entrepreneur, I couldn’t understand - why is information so scattered, hard to find and moreover, why in 2015 (at the time) everything is so offline? Seeing a market opportunity, I talked to a couple of friends, Gian and Pawel and convinced them, that it’s our chance to build something great. Did we have prior experience in building successful tech startups? No. Did we have any experience doing business within the wedding market as non-consumers? Nope. Did we realize how important it is to talk to your users, before building the whole set of features? Not really. Did we have any clue about the challenges of a 2-sided marketplace? We had no clue. But that’s the whole beauty of it - we just went for it and learned stuff the hard way. ‍",0,0
265," I studied Computer Science Engineering at a Regional Engineering College in Uttarakhand and built my career and expertise at HP, working on open-source technologies. I never had to look far for an idol. 35 years ago, my mother founded the only school in my hometown and continues to run it today. I draw inspiration from my mother’s undying spirit to take on challenges and overcome all odds to fulfill her dreams. In 2015, I met my co-founder at Stanford, and the idea of Woovly was seeded. We discovered we had a shared interest in studying and predicting consumer buying behavior and our belief that buyers were increasingly tending towards discovering products and brands online rather than offline.  After the short-term program, I returned to India and worked for two years at Quess Corp. As a part of my responsibilities, I traveled extensively across small towns and cities termed the Tier II and Tier III cities in India and realized that the young population had aspirations to achieve the lifestyle of their peers in Urban India or the Tier I cities. I recognized a latent need for a platform that would allow them to fulfill their ambitions. Later on, when we finally decided to go down the entrepreneurial path, this learning and our faith in online brand discovery led us to social commerce and Woovly. ‍",1,1

267," After graduation, I worked for nearly 5 years as a Senior Technical Manager for a product engineering firm. In 2009, I founded Maruti Techlabs with a single assignment for a client in the United States.  Our story begins with ones. One small assignment, one diligent team, one trusting client, one bold deal. It all started with a simple task for a dependable client. I'm delighted to say that we continue to work for that client.  Since then, we've been cutting our teeth in digital transformation solutions with trailblazing products that set a new standard for conducting smart business. ‍",1,0
268," When I started WURA in 2013, I was actually just recovering from a failed startup the year before. My background is in web development but I consider myself more as a project manager as I rarely get hands-on anymore with my projects. Between 2008 and 2012 I was in the flash gaming business and I ran a successful network of gaming websites, up until early 2012. Several events happened that year that shut down about 80% of my business. First was Google Panda update or Penguin, whichever it was, I lost my Search engine rankings and that alone completely decapitated my business. Also, by this time smartphones had already taken over the market so many gamers that would typically come on the site to play games now go to their mobile phones. And in my efforts to transition to mobile games and join the trend, I essentially lost about $21,000 to a sham game developer on Elance (be very careful when using freelancers for big projects). Long story short, by the time the year was over, I went from making $75k a year to barely making ends meet. I shut down the servers, sold my car, cleaned out my apartment, and moved back in with my parents. As an entrepreneur, your best insurance policy is mom and dad because when things go south (and they will at some point) you at least have a place to lay your head and try to recoup. And so, it was a few months after living on my parent 's couch that the idea of WURA came about. When you live on the couch, you tend to consume a lot of TV and online videos. At least that was the case for me. When I kept watching these movies on YouTube, that’s when the idea came to me. Also, it helped that I saw another person (IROKO TV) running with the same Idea. Later that year Iroko went on to raise $8 million. And I thought for sure there is a big opportunity here. ‍",0,0
269," I am a first-generation immigrant with an engineering & MBA background. Xena Intelligence started as a fun side project while I had a marketing consulting business for SMBs. The idea came about since I observed a huge need in the market for Amazon sellers to compete effectively on that platform. The process of efficiently analyzing data and running efficient ad campaigns can be extremely complex and time-consuming. My idea was to automate the entire process, enabling us to use specific algorithms to optimize further online sales - which was the crux of Xena Intelligence. My experience with the needs of small businesses certainly led me to build this tool to enable them to be more competitive against large companies with considerably more ad budgets. I decided to devote all of my time to Xena and not pursue my consulting business since this avenue had more potential and the possibility of helping out more businesses - it made the idea more scalable. ‍",1,0
270," There’s a theory that there’s a correlation between toxoplasmosis and entrepreneurship - which makes me wonder if maybe I rolled around in some cat poop when I was a kid. Since my first entrepreneurial endeavors as a young person (lemonade stand, lawn mowing services) I’ve often made the risk-ignorant assumption that making a living I’m happy with depended upon learning things for myself and creating structure from nothing over and over and over again.  When it came to Yottio, I had a strong background in building interactive broadcast experiences, including working as head of production for a well-known production company where I was deeply involved in the game design and build for a couple of interactive game shows that we had sold to TBS and BET.  From an interactivity standpoint though, I thought the experiences we were building didn’t push the envelope far enough. However, what we could do with participants also had to accommodate the creative and legal processes that went with putting people on-air were things that weren’t easy to solve. The traditional methods of casting contestants and participants for creative formats are designed to give the creative team the most freedom for good stories, and stories that are technically well-produced, using processes that provided acceptable risk-management for the broadcasters.  When it comes to including participants in a broadcast-media format, three key elements that must be present.  Can producers find a participant that meets their creative requirements?Has the participant agreed to the legal release terms of appearing in the broadcast?Can the participant be seen and heard at high enough quality? When my co-founder showed me the original idea behind the desktop-based platform that he’d built, he had a solution that handled the second requirement pretty well, but the first and third were severely limited by requiring potential participants to be at a desktop PC with a webcam and having integration hardware that wasn’t up to modern broadcasting requirements. It seemed clear that we could create entirely new ways of having conversations if we could build a platform that could let anyone, anywhere, anytime be a part of a broadcast reaching millions of viewers live in a way that still allowed the creative production teams to produce and moderate on the fly and manage risk acceptably in the process.  What really made our product different from regular group video calling platforms was that we had a very slick interface for aggregating tens of thousands of potential participants, screening them rapidly based on things like location, battery and mobile device signal strength, audio & video quality, and social reputation and reach. The platform enabled content producers to drag and drop the participants they wanted into a given conversation while still being able to live moderate and control the conversations discreetly, and then output all of the individual video and audio streams in HD broadcast compatible formats in real-time.  The business model was a mix of professional services where we built and installed hardware packages in broadcast control rooms, licensed our software on those machines and paired the stack with companion mobile apps for iOS, Android and a web app.  I thought that if we got it right, our platform could democratize mass media conversations in a way that had not been done before and that it would inevitably be a good thing.  ‍",0,0
271," Before we started YEP, I was already running one of the largest German podcasts on entrepreneurship and startups. That means I’ve built a strong network of experienced founders and was the go-to person for young and aspiring entrepreneurs. My co-founder built a university in Germany. The CODE University of Applied Sciences, the first university in Germany where you can build a business and it’s helping you to get your bachelor’s degree. While discussing the startup ecosystem, we were realizing the lack of opportunities for young entrepreneurs to connect with peers and get access to an extensive network of experienced entrepreneurs. That’s when we came up with the idea of the Young Entrepreneurs’ Program. ‍",0,0
272," The story is a little long, but here’s the short version. Social media was my first love. I fell in love with Snapchat as an 8th grader, I must’ve been one of the first few thousand users. It totally changed my social life and even how I thought about marketing later on. I made new friends, made other relationships much stronger, and even got into a romantic relationship, all because of social media before 10th grade.  In February of ‘15 I consulted for a company called onLoop, a messaging platform founded by a forty-something year old that was targeting high schoolers and college students. He had raised a little over $1m and had a full team of eleven including a full time CTO and three other engineers. However, within four weeks I told him with his poor engagement metrics there was no possibility to scale economically and raise money, but he knew it wasn’t going well and already wanted to pivot. He wanted to build a live streaming platform because live video was the most popular tool used in onLoop. I agreed it could be a great idea and he challenged me to come up with a fully fledged idea by the following Monday. I then pitched him my idea, the name Zapstream and all the features it would include, I even made some sketches with some preliminary ideas. They loved it, started to build it in March, and offered me a full time position out of high school as the Chief Marketing Officer.  ",0,0
273," Before starting ZenMaid, I worked for a company in Southern California, and I was pretty miserable there. I was working with my best friend, which was pretty much the only redeeming quality of the job. During that time, I started a maid service called “Fast, Friendly, Spotless”. I was just trying to escape my day job, and after getting tired of both projects, I ended up moving back to where I grew up in Silicon Valley. My previous maid service project helped shape the ZenMaid idea. I started ZenMaid with my friend Arun Devabhaktuni at the same time as I joined a startup called UserVoice. I worked at UserVoice for about two years while working on ZenMaid before and after work. And that was a lot better than my previous job. I was much happier. I was always trying to come up with side hustles but always thinking on a very small scale and small level. If I had been thinking bigger from a younger age, I would have come across something like ZenMaid much faster. I left the United States in 2015 and built ZenMaid while traveling to 30+ countries as a digital nomad. I spent most of the time between Bali, Thailand, and Europe (with 1-2 months in the US each year). ",1,0

Every business needs clients, and companies struggle to get them.",1,1
275," The company was started in 2006. The initial goal was to solve a problem the CEO faced: he needed wipes to clean the grease off his hands after fixing his bike. Our brand of cleaning wipes continues to be our flagship product today. However, we’ve expanded into other categories and established the company as one of the largest retailers for facility cleaning, disinfecting, and sanitizing products.   We’re the industry leader in facility cleaning supplies, and experts in facility safety, which encompasses everything from surface disinfecting and cleaning, including List-N approved disinfectants, cleaning, and hand wipes, to electrostatic sprayers, air quality tools, and more. We're proud to provide critical supplies for facilities to keep their employees and guests safe. Before joining Zogics, I ran a digital marketing firm called i3. It was a full-service agency that consulted e-commerce businesses on web development, content marketing, and email nurturing. I was inspired to join Zogics because I wanted to be part of an internal team. At an agency, you gain exposure to different businesses and industries. I wanted to utilize my expertise in e-commerce to help a brand grow. Transitioning from being the CEO of a company I started to CRO of an exiting business was an adjustment. It required humility and an ability to adapt.  ",1,0
