0, Build the easiest MVP possible and get user feedback early. Keep talking to users as you grow the product. This would have saved us MONTHS of time and allowed for an earlier pivot to something that would actually work! ,0,0
1," I’m not sure I could’ve done things differently. That’s not really how I think. I’ve been lucky along the way. I’d of course have avoided some mistakes but what are mistakes but really intensive learning. I’m lucky to have a pretty forgiving conscience. That means I’ve always been late on school papers or deadlines. But it has also allowed me to forget my failures or at least laugh at them pretty quickly. That’s one of the things you learn doing stand-up comedy. Everybody experiences bombing and when you do, you’ve never felt as terrible before. But then you get over it. Repeat until you have no fear of looking dumb left. I recommend everyone try sucking at stand-up at least once! I’m often telling my current self that I should try and work some more on 10er instead of spreading the few spare hours I have on multiple projects. Maybe I should start listening more to him. ‍",1,0
2," I wouldn’t have done anything upfront. Instead, I’d have gone out into the market and checked there was actually demand. I spent two months designing and redesigning the website, Giles had spent time negotiating print discounts with suppliers in America and the UK, We had a nice logo, we printed stickers, we ticked every box, but none of that really mattered…  Because we never took the time to validate the product. And that’s why despite getting all that traffic we had nothing to show for it. There’s a cool story about Patrick McKenzie (@patio11) where he talks about going directly into hair salons, paying for appointments, just to talk to the hairdressers and try and figure out if there’s demand for a barbershop booking service. We basically should have done the equivalent of this. Perhaps, went back to our old school with a couple of demo canvases, talked to the kids, see if they understood the product, see if they were willing to pay £30 for it, whether they even used twitter, or understood the concept.",0,0
3," I would have learned food photography early! Not only is it just loads of fun, visually advertising your work has always been important. I wish I’d been confident early on that I could learn it and simply gone for it. ‍",1,1
4," I would start smaller and gather feedback before building anything. A B2B service is incredibly hard to grow as a side-project or for solopreneurs in general.  “Build it, and they will come” is a big fallacy. Finding customers can be incredibly hard. And even more, if your customers are businesses, not individuals.  Also, I tried to do too much with few resources. I only had a handful of hours per week to invest in the project. Combine that with web design, the backend part, promotion, etc. and it’s overwhelming. I considered outsourcing some of this stuff to freelancers. That way I could have focused more on my strengths and avoided getting frustrated.    I learned a lot of things from this project. The most important one was that I need better and faster ways to validate ideas. I worked for months in my little echo chamber without any real outside feedback. It’s hard to stay motivated throughout this phase, and it’s heart-crushing once you hit the outside world and nobody cares about your product. Also, you don’t just need a product, but a detailed plan on how to promote and grow your business. I didn’t know much about marketing before starting ABBY, and I think a lot of other wannapreneurs have the same issue, but it is necessary to achieve success with your startup.    Start small and find people from your network (or online) who might be good customers. Tell them about your idea and ask them if they would be willing to pay for a service like that. It’s really important to validate your idea quickly and build as little as possible before you know there is a market. In my case, I spent months building a software no one used in the end. That is a depressing experience that you should avoid.  ",0,0
5," Nothing really, except to spend my time on something else. At least I learned from the experience.  Make something you love, not just something you think someone else might like!  ‍",0,0
6, The only advice to my previous self is to hold on and learn money management. I would stop myself from working without pay and would ask myself to be blunt whenever it requires. I’d tell myself that the company is above all kinds of interests and all personal relationships I was the CEO and running this company was my only job. I wish to have spent more time with my customers at the beginning. I would also like to have done my favourite exercise of planning five years ahead and then backtracking till the next coming month. ‍,0,0
7," I would have told myself that you are innocent and forgiven and are worthy of love and acceptance from yourself! But I probably wouldn’t have believed me :).  Would have spent more time on the “fake it til you make it” version of the business that, in hindsight, actually could have been (and still could be) a nice revenue-generating services company. I would have tried to then build software from that revenue and would have used the credibility of that business model to find a true technical co-founder as committed with equity, not an hourly payment or cash/equity split. I was so worried about making a beautiful self-service piece of software that I spent more time on that than I did on revenue creation. I mean to be fair to myself, I would still have had no idea how to convince a brand to pay me to run their blog sponsorship programs for them at the start, either… but had I spent time doing that for free (or cheap), it could have turned into real consistent revenue streams without obsessing over the “purity of SaaS + Commission”. ‍",0,0
8," Jared: Our team is entirely remote right now, which is only partly a function of the pandemic. We’ve found that it’s essential to focus on building culture and community, and it’s also crucial to give our employees flexibility in terms of their location and their hours and roles.  We’re genuinely interested in their well-being because we care about them and think it makes us better as a company. The customer experience isn’t just about our direct interactions with the customer. It’s holistic. How we work with employees and teammates, how we work with partners and providers – all that goes into forming the customer experience, and none of it can be ignored.  Eric: We’ve learned not only that we have to be flexible but also that we have to be open to being wrong. In any business, but especially ours, you’ve got to listen to the customers’ needs and adjust accordingly. Always put yourself in the place of the customer. Since Jared and I come from non-insurance backgrounds, we always come at everything from the customer’s perspective. Would I use this product? Do I get what it is and how it benefits me? What’s the cleanest, quickest way that I would want to see things handled if my phone broke or was stolen?  And in doing that, we’ve discovered that a great customer experience not only helps you attract and retain customers but it also makes you an attractive partner for other businesses. Everyone wants to work with you when you’re doing things the right way. ‍",1,0
9," Focus on a product that can be easily tested. That means products that an SMB can try, or an individual within an enterprise can test - but that does not require the entire enterprise to test. Focus on a product that can be quickly tested. That means user benefit is measurable within hours or days, not weeks (and certainly not months or years). Ideally, the first time a user tries the product he or she can say “I see this benefiting me X amount in Y way, so I would pay Z for this.”Don’t raise money from VCs customers are using a product and that product is ready for some level of scaling. “Working product” does NOT include services/consulting projects.Don’t rely on personal charisma for initial sales/marketing it doesn’t scale, it’s hard to improve via experimentation, and it’s exhausting. Focus on more scalable approaches like online/offline paid marketing, SEO, and partnerships. ‍",0,0
10,"  I realized that you shouldn’t waste too much time making the software perfect. Launch as soon as possible, get in some valuable feedback from customers and users. I learned that there are tons of things you can’t expect, and the fastest way to face them is to go live and put your product out there.  Staying ambitious, focusing on your goals, and spending as much time as possible on the project is what got us where we are now. There is no low-effort way leading to major success unless you are insanely lucky.",1,0
11," Start delivering a product or service without technology… this validates demand and only then can technology be used to drive efficiency, leading to greater margin.    Start delivering your product or service, and take ca$h… without technology to validate demand )  ",0,0
12," As cliche as it may sound, I would not change a single thing we’ve done so far. We’ve learned a ton from our “limitations”. Answering support tickets while in class or having a lack of time more generally has allowed us to ask better questions and focus on staying lean.  It’s easy to decide to hire another person but that’s how you easily build a bloated company. Instead, we ask how could we get it done with what we do have.  Better questions, better answers.  ",1,0
13," In the beginning, I focused on growing slowly with a great focus on quality. As funds were running out, I started meeting with investors and startup founders and thereby, shifting to fundraising too soon. As a result, we started to focus on growing at a faster rate, partially responsible for the mechanics burning out and leaving. Partnering with a carpool startup also was a mistake because that it the workload tremendously. In the end, I would focus on growing much slower and burning much less money by hyper-focusing in a very small community for an extended period of time. ‍  I learned a few things along this journey. Some of them are: Never try to spend too much money on customer acquisition. Instead, look for organic and innovative methods to acquire clients.Focus on retention and not on speed.Customers were very happy with our service and I realized that the India customer experience needs to be improved tremendously, which also means a lot of opportunities to make a big difference from competitors. ‍",0,0
14," The greatest lesson we learned along the way was essentialism - staying focused and working as a team towards one primary goal.  What you need to do is focus on the main task until it's completed. Then switch to another one. Don't try to focus on multiple goals at once, or nothing will work properly.  Other lessons we've already mentioned before are testing different hypotheses and scaling from day one. Think big but don't be afraid of failures!  And last but not least, find the right community that will contribute to your growth and development. ‍",1,0
15," When I was taking over BaseTemplates, my biggest fear was losing my initial investment because we would drop on the Google rankings, or no one would see the products anymore. But looking back, that was total nonsense. I would now tell my former self to have trust and just do the things that feel right, and the business success will come no matter what. For me, the biggest lever in our company history was getting our strategy right and really finding out what works and what doesn't. I wish I had spent more time on that at earlier stages.  ‍",1,0
16," I think we should have given more consideration to our product launch strategy and the number of fragrances we carry. The variety we provide is nice, but operationally it slows down our ability to scale and keep things in stock. It’s a double-edged sword that gives us a competitive advantage in some sense so it makes sense to keep it. It would also erode some of the trust we’ve built up with our customers if we decided to kill a large part of our offerings. At the time we made those decisions it seemed to be a smart idea.  ",1,0
17, You can’t always get where you want to be in one go. Sometimes you have to make lots of small steps to get there. The business you’re looking to set up is one such example: most of the successful IT support companies that started small targeted individuals as well as businesses and only dropped individuals from their portfolio when they’d established a sufficient reputation. ‍,0,0
18," I am competitive and determined to win, and I’m not a quitter. But until you quit what isn’t working, you can’t do the next thing. I was so determined to make it work that I didn’t hear what the market was saying. Dating sites were a terrible beachhead market. We were not getting traction. Every site we spoke to talked loudly about being worried about online fraud, but when push came to shove, they weren’t actually willing to do anything about it. Friction was a much bigger concern than fraud.    I learned that my opinion doesn’t count, only the market’s opinion. And you have to listen to actions, not words. People might tell you they love your technology but unless they are willing to give you a credit card number, the words mean nothing. ‍",0,1
19," From a product perspective, listen to your paying customers, stay the course, stay focused. As cliche as it is, grit is the way when trying to do big things. Years of being in business have created a great network to lean on. We raised our pre-seed round from friends, family, and former customers. Most of our team has been together for many years on other projects. Consistency has paid off in a big way for Bildr, and I’m confident that trend will continue. ",1,0
20," I wouldn’t take it so seriously. The Birdy was a cool little app, and it certainly had potential to become something bigger. But in the beginning, it’s simplicity was what made it special. Instead of letting that worry me so much, I would just let it ride and concentrate on making sure it lasted for a long time.  Have a solid network of people to talk to. That helped me immensely. Don’t quit your day job. And start saving money now if you intend to launch a business. Personally, I found that I make bad decisions when there’s too much financial pressure. If I don’t need a product to pay my rent, I can maintain a longer-term view and do what the business needs, rather than what I need.  ",0,0
21," In the B2B world, it is of high importance to learn not to rely solely on paid ads.  Don’t get me wrong I’m not saying that paid-ads don’t serve their purpose, but don’t forget who are we dealing with here.  Serving and working with high-ticket service providers require some serious preparation, a well-thought detailed business plan, and short and long-term strategies, not just paid ads.  They work splendidly in the B2C arena when you are addressing a different type of audience and offering not-so-pricey services.  So, what I am saying is first, know your target.  In my case, what has worked best was reaching out to people. I used, and I still am using, LinkedIn as my main work platform.  Going out cold is scary for sure, but it’s the only way to get yourself some of the valuable connections you desperately want.  But, please, don’t get me wrong. Approaching the cold way does not equal bothering or spamming people. Nothing gives us the right to attack and invade someone’s personal space without being asked to do so.  What I’ve learned when doing outreach over these many years is instead of focusing on selling our services, we should focus more on establishing and building a valuable connection with our potential prospects.  Mastering skills like listening, and I mean listen to what the other person is saying without offering them a relatable story of yours, is one of the first steps of this long-term outreach strategy of mine. Because people can sense when you really listen and when you genuinely care.  And that’s how you slide them down your sales funnel.  When you have established a grounded, caring relationship with someone, the sales meeting is just the next logical step in your relationship. ‍",1,0
22," Two main things: distribution is everything and the power of email. I’m still largely focused on my SaaS product in terms of what I’m looking to grow into my main income stream, but if I had to start from scratch, I’d do an email-first strategy today. So much of the marketing activity I work on these days revolves around optimizing for email engagement. Didn’t expect that coming into this experience! But on top of that, I learned just how demanding it is to run a community. There aren’t any days off for good behavior: you have to show up every single day and be there for people. Communities don’t run on their own without someone there to facilitate, build connections, and make things happen. Even when I’m on vacation, I still check into the community at least once per day. ",1,1
23," I’m not sure we could have done anything differently. In that environment, the technology was not near where it was today, and that was one of our main stumbling blocks. The site could have been developed for a fraction of the cost today, but there was no way we could know that back then. The time and place for the business idea were just not right. Sometimes that is just the way it goes!  I learned a lot from this project. Personally, it proved to me that I wasn’t ready at the time to be a full-time entrepreneur. I knew that I needed to develop my skills more in the workforce before I felt confident enough to execute a strategy more effectively.  Additionally, it showed me that “going all in” is probably not suited for my personality. A lot of people don’t realize how much pressure there is on you when you have no other source of income to survive. Personally, I have had much more success doing a side project now and growing it slowly rather than disrupting my life in order to validate my ideas.    I would advise going the route of starting small and not risking everything if this is your first project. The harsh reality is that most new businesses will not succeed and I think from a strategy perspective it makes sense to get more validation on your idea before you are willing to quit your day job.  ",0,0
24," SHAKED: It’s easy to say now, but market validation is definitely one of the 1st things I’d do. Specifically, in Botnim’s case, I would have checked with people what they want before assuming it, then execute accordingly. ‍  SHAKED: As a maker & software engineer, the most important part is not to be attached to your code. Going from a chatbot to a web application meant throwing all of the chatbot’s code and not looking back. Thinking about this decision retrospective, it was one of our best decisions. Having said that, I think that it is a good practice to have something first and then improve/change it. ‍",0,0
25," First-time entrepreneurs think mostly about the product. Second-time entrepreneurs think about distribution. I’ve learned a lot about the importance of distribution and its role in a company’s growth. And although I already knew that the team behind a company is critically important, I’ve learned a lot about how best to build that team. Surround yourself with the right people, who will take an idea and run with it, and you won’t go wrong. You have to make time to build that team of people that you can share your vision with and have them make it real. Do that, and everything else has a way of falling into place.",1,0
26," There are tons of things we could have improved on a tactical level, but here are a few of our biggest learnings: Map out every step of your operations and mark where issues occur visualizing where your incidents occur helps you prioritize when negotiating SLAs with partners.Budget carefully and assume that surprises will arise. We included a contingency in our model for legal fees, freelancers, salaries, damage and more, and it’s a good thing we did because those mistakes add up fast.Great photography is critical to conversion. We should have invested in high quality photography earlier than we did, but we’ve done better in recent months (see below!) ‍",1,0
27," We should have tried to solve a smaller problem better. Now we ended up having a half-assed product, instead of half a product. We didn’t really solve anyone problem completely. We should have decided on one target group and one of their problems and solved that elegantly. Now we ended up having multiple people’s multiple problems, on top of a very customizable infrastructure that we had to adapt to.    Solve a focused, critical problem. Don’t try to solve everything, but one, very important thing. It doesn’t matter if the solution isn’t perfect as long as you work closely with your users and solve something worth a lot to them.  ",0,0
28," I think I’d not get so caught up in the roller-coaster of running a business. You can literally be on the front-page of Hacker News, and the next day lose your top 3 customers. The market is incredibly volatile, especially in tech, so you’ll need a tough stomach to weather the storm. I’d also tell my former-self to write more than is necessary or comfortable. It makes you spell things out in a different way and challenge your beliefs that you hold, plus it helps you get on another folk’s radar. At the very least you’ll get some notoriety about what you’re doing, and it’ll likely open doors down the road. Plus, you might earn a few customers while doing it. Lastly, I wouldn’t optimize the service for every use-case under the sun. Certain sets of customers just aren’t worth all the time that they can potentially pull out of you. You have to optimize for the best customers out there, which means being open to pivots or changing who you market to. ‍",1,0
29," I would hire a marketing person right from the start. We completely underestimated the amount of effort our marketing would require. We thought a couple of ads and a couple of blog posts would be enough to let people know about us. If I had the chance to go back, I would look for someone working on marketing in our space and hire them right away, as soon as money permitted. After some time passes, you can see everything more clearly. Of course, if we knew placing ads didn’t work, we would have spent much less time and money trying to set them up. Finding the right marketing strategy has been particularly time-consuming, but it is a process you need to go through. I wish I spent more time talking to potential customers. After 3 years of operation, I still find people who do not “get” what we do. This does not mean they are dumb, it means I cannot explain it properly (so I am the dumb one). I try to talk a lot with customers and potential customers, but I still think more time would have led to better results. Before starting Bugfender, we also tried another product. It was called “PlayThis” and it was a collaborative playlist to choose the music you play in a party. We had the business plan to make it free or cheap for private parties (e.g. at home) and sell it to bars. We built the product for a few months until we had a working version on the app store. Do you know who went visit the bars during this time? Nobody! Do you know how many copies we sold of the software? None, ever. This taught us a valuable lesson: we need to talk to the customers before building anything. Because I know it is a big learning curve and a common mistake among founders, I want to emphasize: do not write a single line of code until you have someone willing to pay for it. It’s even better if you can get someone to pay in advance (or at least commit to buying). Besides funding your project, this will guarantee it has the necessary bits and pieces and provides a solution (at least to one person). And the contrary is true: it does not matter how amazing your technology or good your idea is. If nobody knows about it, nobody will buy it. Once you talk to your first potential customers, you will realize they might need something completely different from what you had in mind, or what you thought was an unexplored market opportunity, turns out nobody cares. On the technology side, I would have chosen a well-known technology stack from the beginning. It would not have been as much fun, but it would have helped to speed up the project and we would have saved money. We have had to beef up our hardware for a while now because of poorly performing software and that cost us thousands of dollars every month. Also, we are handling a peculiar workload, since we write terabytes of logs every month but at the same time, we have to make them easily available for when a user wants to check them. Striking a good balance in these optimizations is complex, let alone if you are not very comfortable or experienced with the tech stack. ‍",1,0
30," I would think in use cases. Not features. Not benefits. Use cases.  What are the use cases that you really solve? How can you solve them better than anyone? The biggest mistake most startups make is that we (myself included) think that we need more features to bring more customers. Wrong. Completely wrong.  You don’t need to go after all customers at the same time. Find a use case. Go after it. Validate it. Get the first customer. Get the first 10 customers on the same use case. Get the next 100 customers, and then go from there. ‍",1,0
31," Focus less on the income and more on the audience. I was so put off by the limited earnings potential that I never gave it my best effort. I treated that app more like an experiment, mostly because I was afraid to commit to it more than that. ‍  Focus on building your audience first. That doesn't mean you can't charge for your services, but don't expect the money that comes in at first to be significant. I think the point of charging at first is to validate that folks will pay for the idea. Is it a good enough product that folks find it valuable enough to hand over the money?  ",0,0
32," I may have started a little sooner if I would have had the courage, and yet the timing has been perfect. Timing is everything and you can't think too much about the what-if's in life. I can honestly say that I wouldn't change a thing about my story and how things ended up. There is always something you could have done differently, but then you never learn. I try not to look much into the rear-view mirror – the windshield has a much better view ahead. :) ‍",1,0
33, I would have told him you need to either focus on making this a product that your mom can use or the other path to success is to prove to a VC or other investor that you're a good bet and spend all your time raising money and not on the product.  Don’t split your time between product and fundraising.  Make the plan to make a good product and then go fundraise or make a great product and go to market. I wish I had more determination to raise money.  I think we had a good team and good sense for what made a good business we just needed a runway to get product-market fit.  ,0,0
34," I would have been more careful on who we hired as a web developer, considering we got burned with the first developer we used.  Also, rules in British Columbia state that a business needs to have a business licence. That’s simple, but I didn’t get a business licence right away, thinking that an online marketplace business doesn’t need a licence. I eventually got one but the time lost cost me because I wasn’t able to apply for provincial grants for education without a business licence.  When we started Campertunity, we set everything up perfectly: we had our P.O. Box ready to go, our Zendesk, Sendgrid, and whatever add on needed to help run Campertunity. But, some of them weren’t needed and after the first year, we are realizing that we don’t need a P.O. Box anymore, or even some of the helper apps we pay for. So, we are able to cut costs by understanding that it’s okay to start small and add on what we need as we grow.  ",1,1

36," Niches make riches. You’re not limiting yourself by choosing a well-defined niche for your business. You’re often limiting yourself by trying to appeal to everyone and starting too broad. If you try to appeal to everyone, you’ll appeal to no one. Even Amazon began by just selling books.Collaborate with competitors. There’s room for more than one business to succeed in a niche. You can befriend a few like-minded founders in your niche, help each other, and all benefit. Abundance mindset!Who you know matters, a lot. Build relationships whenever possible, and look to help others first. Asking for favors upfront isn’t networking!Consistency is key. I didn’t do anything particularly quickly, but I kept making progress and chipping away. I had slow months but I kept moving forward. As long as you’re inching closer to your goal, that’s okay.Don’t reinvent the wheel. For most business challenges, someone else has already solved it (and written about it/talked about it). You don’t need to try to tackle every problem on your own, from scratch. Use templates for things like sales pages and marketing emails, search Google for problems you’re facing, etc. Hire help. It’s okay to take inspiration from other businesses, too (just don’t plagiarize).Never stop learning. Every time I’ve thought I knew everything about a topic, I discovered how much more I had to learn. Stay humble and keep learning. Or else one of your competitors who’s doing that will pass you!

37," Honestly, I probably would avoid food business! There have been so many food startups over the years, including some that raised tens of millions of dollars, but most of them went out of business (SpoonRocket, Sprig, Maple) or drastically shrunk in size (Munchery). There are very little barriers to entry in this space so price is ultimately what everyone competes on. At the same time, consumers have no loyalty to food brands they will happily try a bunch and switch to another service if they can get a better deal. But if I have to do Chowdy again, I would try to raise money as soon as we hit $1M in annual revenue. At this point, it becomes relatively easy to raise money, and with the money I would hire a team to manage all the day-to-day operations so I can focus on the big picture specifically, growth, risk assessment, and contingency planning. Related to this but a much more significant strategic change I would make is to find a strategic partner and/or acquirer as early as we could. I was starting to toy with this idea in my head by the time we had to shut down but I never got around to implementing it. The idea is to partner up with a large company that can get a lot of synergy (I know I hate this word too) from our business model. I was specifically thinking about grocery chains. I think grocery stores would’ve loved to partner with us because we could help them acquire a fast-growing segment of the market that they don’t already own: people who don’t cook. This arrangement would solve our distribution problem once and for all because grocery chains already have a large and stable real estate network. I’m not quite sure if this would solve our regulatory issue, but I have a hunch that if our distribution partners were large grocery chains instead of mom-and-pop cafes, the health department would’ve treated it very differently. In fact, a year after we shut down, I read about a meal kit startup in Montreal being acquired by Metro, one of the largest grocery chains in Canada. It’s obviously too late at that point, but it made me regret that we didn’t reach out to one of them sooner. ‍",0,0
38," I've always been surprised by how patient our initial customers were with us. At the time many of them joined, Circle was missing a lot of the “table stakes'' features and things that any community tool should have. Despite that, our customers were incredibly supportive. Literally, Circle wouldn't exist without the support of the first 10-20 customers that took a big chance on us. We’ve found that people are very open-minded and very patient if you're just upfront with them. That was one of the biggest lessons for me: to not try and make everything perfect before getting it out there into the world. ‍  One of the biggest things I was worried about early on was doing 1-on-1 demos and showing a very early product. When creators use our tool, they are showing off Circle to their entire community. They rely on it for their business. That's a big responsibility that a lot of times, we feel the weight of. I lead marketing and growth so I’m often the one who’s talking about Circle and positioning it in the market. And I really do want to make sure that the right people end up using Circle and that we disqualify the people that’s not the right fit. What I would've told myself early on would be to just get really clear about who our best customers are, and try being really upfront about whether or not Circle is the right fit for their specific use case. ‍",1,0
39," Probably be even more aggressive, move faster and be more determined. We were all learning along the way, so that came with a great amount of uncertainty. Looking back, it’s easy to say that we could’ve been faster, smarter, etc.  On the other hand, I think we avoided much of the mistakes that other companies have done - we were right on concentrating on distribution and marketing early on, to gain traction, attract investors, people, and have something to step on in order to develop the product. ‍",1,0
40," If you’re struggling with launching a SaaS business, try a service. It’s so much easier to spot a “job to be done” because as a service business, you generally perform a literal job function. There’s no guessing as to whether or not someone would find value because you should be able to go on LinkedIn and find people whose job it is to do your proposed service internally for the company. If you start thinking in this way you’ll quickly see that you can do nearly Anything As A Service.Don’t be a snob about SaaS vs service businesses. I was. If you’re looking to get out of having to work for someone else, the quickest way might be a service. Give it a shot!Service revenue comes faster than SaaS revenue and in higher dollar amounts. Yes, the margins can be lower, but not always and certainly not forever as you build out a brand and expand offerings.Scaling people processes (and building people processes) is a very different skill set than building engineering teams and software. It’s a skill set I need to improve upon.Upwork kind of sucks. Great freelancers are hard to find, pay them well. Building trust in a service business is hand-to-hand combat. It’s tactile and visceral because you’re face-to-face with customers (over zoom of course). This is one thing I’ll take with me into every new SaaS I build. The same level of trust needs to be there for SaaS, but for a self-serve product, you don’t always get the opportunity to speak with every customer before they sign up. This means you need to build the same amount of trust but generally have to do it through the product and brand.So many things have to go right for a business to get off the ground, and so few things have to go wrong to kill the whole thing.

42," If we could do it all over again, I would have focused more time on understanding the relationship between the Profit & Loss statement, cash flow, and high margin products. Lots of people watch ABC’s Shark Tank and believe they understand the process, but there’s a little more involved. Are you operating on cash or accrual method? Does your cash support the lead time on the product if your demand grows significantly? Are your bills spread evenly through the month? Or do they hit in a big chunk? Doing it all over again, we would have paid more attention to these details from the get-go. Another thing we wouldn’t do is focus on retail. Over the past five years, consumers made a major swing toward online purchasing. This put a huge hurt on retailers. They’re adjusting--meaning they’re sticking with their highest margin brands and taking a little risk on new brands. Without a major windfall event where retail customers demand product, breaking into the major retailers is time-consuming, expensive, and low margin. Focus on direct to consumer sales. When the retailers come, it will be an added bonus.",1,0
43," I don’t think I would start over and do it differently, although this it sounds a bit cliche. Community Coders was an absolutely amazing experience, and the fact is, I learned a ton. I believe that a lot of people glorify the failure of their businesses, and instead, what I think should be emphasized is learning. Failing sucks. Throughout my time building Community Coders, I was able to learn a combination of learning hard and soft skills that I believe will be translatable to the workplace, my projects, and my personal life. If I had to have three key, summarized points to tell myself, here’s what I would say: Find a profitable, consistent, customer acquisition method as early as possible (this is harder said than done) for your MVP/pilot project.Document your journey, whether it’s through videos, blogs, tweets, etc. At a stage where nobody knows your venture, you are the best form of marketing for your early-stage business. What I might suggest is, instead of trying to start your company’s social media accounts, start trying to grow yours and connect with people in your target market.Understand that when you step into building a business, it can be a long 5+ year journey. This is something that I didn’t take into account when I started out. ",0,0

48," I'm not leaving this industry of creators, I'm not getting offline anytime soon. I can't imagine working for anyone else other than creators. Every single project I ever do is for creators. I’ve learned a few lessons from Creator Growth Lab. A product needs to immediately do more for the user. It’s got to feel like a superpower.  The problem is the same every creator on Earth has, which is how to live off a piece of work I made. ‍  One of the most important things I learned was that I talked to users, but I was not listening to them. I had so much hubris and very little humility because I had been successful at helping people grow for five years. “I went into Creator Growth Lab thinking I knew everything. You don't know anything. Even if you think you know everything you don't.” I spent a lot of time educating creators on why to use the product. Every successful creator will tell you that they grew by making good content. Creators want to create. I had no competitors. No one was trying to do this, that’s a warning sign. It ended up being not needed. Another lesson learned was that you need to talk with users, not just tell them about your product. I've only started to do this within the past years and it opened my mind. When I get on the phone with a user I'm not teaching them how to use the product. I get on the phone once or twice a week with my newsletter readers and ask them about what's going on in their life. Just chatting with them. I would have never tried new ventures if I didn't talk to the same users again and heard the same problems again with a different frame of mind and a different angle into it. Your solution might not pan out and doesn't mean your business doesn't work. It doesn't mean you're not successful. It means that solution didn't work out. Figure out who your tribe is. Find them. If you talk to people for enough time, keep trying different solutions, and keep asking for their problems, you'll figure out a solution. You always have something to learn. ‍",0,0

50," So, super tactically: don’t do limited-edition coupons. The night before the prelaunch opened, I sent an email to the waitlist with a coupon for $20 off. It was limited to the first 50 people who used it. That coupon got used up in the first 90 seconds. It takes more than 90 seconds for an email broadcast to complete, so there were people who clicked the link the moment they got the email, only to discover that the coupon code didn’t work. Dozens of people emailed me telling me that the coupon was broken. Worse, about 50 people were shown that the coupon was successfully applied but later realized they were charged the total amount because the coupon expired in the seconds between when it was applied and when the checkout process was completed. I issued partial refunds for everyone affected, but it was chaos for those first couple of days.  More broadly, I think that the pre-launch was so successful because I have such a high-quality bar. It’s trendy in certain circles to ship quickly, start with a barebones MVP, and iterate. And while I do agree that perfectionism can be dangerous, I do think it’s worth spending the time required to make sure you’re delivering something solid.  It’s a nice idea to spend 2 weeks on a proof-of-concept to validate demand, but what if the only thing you’re validating is that people don’t want to buy something that only took you 2 weeks to build? If you’re doing something totally unprecedented, then this is probably a good idea. But if you’re following in the footsteps of successful businesses, as I was with Wes Bos and Kent C. Dodds, the demand is already validated. You just need to nail the execution. ",1,0
51," It seems painfully obvious now, but there are two things that I will not do as an entrepreneur going forward. I won’t put in my own money. OK, I’ve broken this rule with AwardCat but that was a really cheap business to build. It cost me less than $3,000 in coding using a great team in Ukraine (I worked with them onsite in Kyiv), and it has made considerably more than that. If I were building a crazy high risk, venture-scale startup again, I’d raise venture capital or go home. Venture investors spread risk across a portfolio but founders only have one startup.I’ll get paid. Fundamentally, I need a place to live, enough to eat, and health insurance. I can get a tech job with approximately zero risks so if I start a startup, my “skin in the game” is the fact that I’m working more hours and making less money than another job. Living under a bridge (although fortunately it never came to that for me) is a truly massive distraction and startups require your full attention. ",0,0
52," Building Delite was an amazing learning experience and I don’t regret anything. It was the most fun professional experience I’ve ever had. But in a completely hypothetical situation, this is what I would do differently. ‍ Find 5 or 10 customers willing to pay before building the product: Get them interested and get their input on what they need. I would hack together prototypes as fast as possible using Typeform and do a lot of manual work behind the scenes. ‍ We would have charged money for Delite from the beginning, and charged more than we “thought it was worth”: We wanted to give away our product for free to our first customers. In B2B, a free product signals a bad product and you look desperate if you offer it for free. And if you think it’s worth $50/month, charge $100/month. ‍ More cold calling and have a better marketing approach: We were all over the place in our marketing, sometimes doing full days of cold calling and emailing, but never really following up multiple times and having a “real” sales process. ‍  First of all, if you have an idea, just try to build it. Sit down for a day and try to hack something together. You don’t have to know how to code to do that. You can use tools like Typeform and Webflow to build real applications. If you’re reading this, you’re already doing it right. It probably means you are interested in entrepreneurship and starting your own business. Never before has it been easier to start your own app, brand, business, etc. You don’t need VC funding anymore to create a technology company. Sites like Failory, Hacker News, IndieHackers, Product Hunt, etc are creating a revolution in entrepreneurship and lifestyle. Just try to soak everything in and make sure you are always on the creating side of it. Work on an idea that you are passionate about. I’m passionate about building apps and starting companies, but I wasn’t passionate about the idea behind Delite or the problems that Delite was solving. After our YC interview, I lost the motivation to keep working on it. I wonder if I would have kept going if I really believed in the idea. Find something that can work for your schedule.

55," I would tell my former self to relax, stay patient, keep working hard and everything will work out. It’s so easy to seek instant gratification and to push for positive growth to happen very quickly. However that can lead to people taking shortcuts, which will lead to mistakes. I wish I would’ve spent more time on sales/business development in the beginning instead of content/social media.  A business doesn’t run off of likes & comments, it runs off of revenue & sales. I’ve found that auditing what you’re doing every hour of every day is great to measure true productivity/output.  You can work 10 hours, but in reality you might’ve only focused on high-priority tasks for 2 hours and the other 8 hours was low-priority tasks. Focus your time in the morning on the high-priority tasks ( marketing, sales, client communication ), then spend time on other lower-priority tasks.  ",1,0
56," From a content creation side, I’ve learned that if you went through it, someone needs to hear about your experiences. We are not so unique that no one has ever experienced similar problems before. You can help someone by creating something that teaches what you learned.  This means that you should write about it (or shoot a video, podcast, or make a post). Someone is going to get something from your story, even if you don’t think there’s anything particularly useful or remarkable about it.  From a business and operations side, I’ve learned the power of delegation. If you want to be successful at what you do, then you won’t be able to do it alone. It’s important that you select good partners and associates to team up and delegate work to as well as putting great systems in place to help you achieve this.

57," A few things: - We would validate the idea at the conceptual level by creating a few ad campaigns and digital marketing campaigns to gauge user interest and need. We’d interview the target or potential customer segments and try to understand the problem and not assume a need. - I would definitely not put a lot of emphasis on domain name or invest a lot of money without researching the potential of the name. - I would build the product in its entirety as an API, SDK rather than a service and launch it toward the developer network e.g. like Twilio only focused towards personalization. - I would find an ecosystem to market to as it’s hard to acquire customers directly. I would also educate, engage and involve myself in the world that my initial customer segment lives in. - I would create a much better customer acquisition strategy either via personal recruitment or ecosystem mining.

58," I've learned a ton about profiting on scalability. Before Embarque, I had only worked with agencies as a freelancer and had no idea about the business development side of things. I didn't have a sense of people's purchasing habits for high-ticket content marketing services. As I mentioned, I mistakenly thought that my main market would consist of people who would buy single articles or the lower-tier packages. In reality, we mostly have repeat clients who pay for the top packages valued at $1250 or above. B2B clients will pay a lot for vendors who can scale their content production without much hassle. Why? Because scaling production is a process in itself that requires coordinating, vetting, and hiring writers, editors, fact-checkers, and content strategists. If a vendor can relieve them of these tasks, clients will be willing to pay more so that they can focus on other strategic initiatives that will help grow their business. Another important lesson that I've learned is that there is a limit to being scrappy. Scrappy is great when you're in the process of getting your first clients. That said, once you've achieved product-market fit, not having robust processes due to an overreliance on scrappiness and 'quick' fixes can lead to problems later on. I learned this the hard way when I didn't spend enough time hiring new writers and had to turn down a very big potential client. Make sure that you're quick to react to market changes and trends, but not at the cost of building processes and systems that allow your startup to work and grow. Finally, I've known this for quite a long time but somehow forgot along the way: use your connections. I was so busy building my own company and making it seem like I knew what I was doing that I forgot that there are people in my network willing to help me thrive and succeed in growing Embarque. Contact the people you've worked well with in the past. If they are willing to work with you again, this can eliminate a lot of hassle in the hiring process.",1,0

I didn’t fully appreciate the difference between starting a business on your own and having a team of colleagues to fall back on when you work for someone else. I think finding something that doesn’t necessarily feel like work would make it easier during the tough times and make you more likely to stick to it. I really enjoy solving problems and I have an interest in coding and design (enjoying something doesn’t necessarily make you good at it!) and I find these enjoyable so tend to focus my efforts on these. I’ve learned that it’s equally important to focus on the aspects that I’m not so good at it, like the sales and marketing side, and for my next venture will be focusing a lot more time and effort on these. One of the things that held me back at the start was worrying about not knowing what I was doing and the fear of getting it wrong or negative feedback.

You might get it wrong or fail, but if you don’t try then you definitely will fail.

73," We learned so much along the way. If there was some way we could accelerate that learning, it would be worthwhile. But just knowing where we were at, and what we knew at the time and the information we had, I have no regrets. Design is very important, but having something that looks good is at least half the battle. But at the same time, perfection is the enemy. If you're waiting to launch because something needs to be perfect, then you're moving way too slowly. “It's also really powerful if you're building a web app to be able to build web apps.” When I think about starting a business, I evaluate it from several perspectives that I didn't before. I use the framework from 80,000 hours, which isn't a business site, but I like the way they think. When you go to tackle a problem, look at it in three dimensions. How many people have this problem? How important is this problem to them individually? How easy is this to solve? You have to ask yourself how easy it is to solve with the things you have now. How much easier would it be to solve if I utilized all my resources? The vision we had for Formatically required resources that Tyler and I didn't have, we had to learn them. Because we were young, we were in a place in our lives where it was normal for us to recognize we needed resources, then go to school, or go get jobs to learn those things. We were missing the ability to design and write code. So let's go learn to do that. I think that was really valuable. I'm not confident we did in the most effective way though. Thanks to no-code tools and coding bootcamps, design schools, companies like Webflow, it makes designing and building quite a bit easier. I say there are definitely more effective ways to get there than we did. ‍  Get feedback on everything you're doing. The idea, the prototypes, the drawings, the sketch files. “Get feedback. Don't be afraid to reach out to people.” One place to start is other people who are starting businesses, but the best people you can talk to are your actual customers. If you struggle to find real customers to talk to, that's a very uncomfortable realization, but it's a helpful realization that the thing you're solving doesn't have many people who need it, or you're not in a good position yet to be able to solve, talk to and interact with those people. The people I've seen who've been the most successful are the ones who have a clear path. They have a clearer understanding of what the problem is and a clear path to the people who are feeling that problem. If you have those two things, then you just need to solve the problem. If you don't, then you need a marketing background. You need to have a lot of conversations with those people. ‍",0,0

If you have an idea, sit on it for a bit. Take the time to talk to users (or potential users) about it and see if it keeps coming back to you. Good ideas always find a way of staying on your mind. I’ve had many nights where I can’t sleep because I’m thinking through all the ramifications of a potential new idea. If that starts often happening with an idea, it’s probably time to start building it! Also, be clear about why you’re creating your business. For us, it’s not all about growth and money. I genuinely believe that there’s a different way to run a business than the usual pressure cooker, growth at all costs approach. That’s not what we want for our lives. So why lie to ourselves and try to build a business in that way? Our goal for Frontend Mentor is to build a calm, sustainable business that is a pleasure to work in. If we’re lucky enough to grow a team, we plan to create a healthy work environment where everyone is treated with respect and trusted to do the work they were hired to do. It amazes me how many companies still treat their employees like children, forcing specific work hours and micro-managing every part of their role. I’ve read some books over the past couple of years that have shaped my thinking, and I’d recommend to anyone looking to build a calm company: Company of One by Paul JarvisLost and Founder by Rand FishkinStart Small, Stay Small by Rob WallingIt Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson (slightly hesitant to recommend this after the recent Basecamp announcements, but it’s still a good book)Essentialism by Greg McKeownThe Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson and Tim FerrissHappy Sexy Millionaire by Steven BartlettLife Profitability by Adii PienaarZero to Sold by Arvid Kahl  We’ll see what happens as the business grows, but it will be fun experimenting with different ways of working and finding what feels right for us! ‍",1,0

If you could talk to your former self before Gadget Flow, what would you tell him? Be patient.Were you worried about anything when starting that you now realize doesn't matter? Fear is your worst enemy and I was afraid of failing but then I realized that the more committed, passionate and excited you are the fewer chances of failing.  ‍",1,0
78," I definitely would do thorough research before starting an online business. It’s crucial to have a look at the competition and analyze keywords to determine if you have a chance to compete with reasonable resources. The benefit of an online business is that you have valuable data available before you even get started. I absolutely would work with that data and then make a decision.  Even if starting an online business is quite easy, you shouldn’t make it an easy decision. If you make a wrong decision at the start, it can become a huge waste of time and money. This can be avoided by doing your homework before you get started. Another advice I have is to always stay focused. If you’re smarter than I was when I started the gaming affiliate site and if you’ve done your homework, it’s crucial to stay focused on your main business objectives. Stick to your plan and don’t get lost in details or unprofitable tasks. ‍",0,0
79," I like to look at this as “what will I do differently next time” -- as I think it’s important to note that in spite of the outcome not being what we wanted, nor expected, I don’t regret anything about the experience. We achieved a lot at GawkBox -- raising $4.4M, getting to 500k and making more than $1M in revenue is no small feat, and I’m extremely proud of that. If I were to replay the experience and take a different pathway, I may not have experienced what I did or acquired the skills that I did -- all of which will set me up even better for my future endeavors. After reflecting on my experience for the past few months, there are some key aspects that I would think about differently next time around.  Spend more time with customers, particularly as CEO. Three types of customers are too many -- you simply don’t have the capacity to understand each of them deeply enough!Use that customer time to ensure that you’re building something customers actually need. Cure their cancer, don’t scratch an itch. Create a product that solves an ongoing pain so that people will pay for it, repeatedly.Better understand the unit economics of the business so you know how many users/customers you need to make it work. Force yourself to have conversations with other companies in the space. Know your competition, but don’t be afraid of them. You can out-execute them!Wait until you have strong product retention before scaling sales & marketing investment. (I’m not saying don’t invest at all -- but optimize investment toward areas that will help you validate the product is what people need)Take heed of your data when making strategic decisions. Recognize when something is working, and when something is not.When difficult situations arise (and they always will) -- focus on how much you’re learning from it to help you get through. ",0,0
80," If I could do things differently I would have started into tech the same way we started GenM. With a small team of talented co-founders who had complementary skills and mindsets and the same drive. I would have followed the right process from day 1 and started with an MVP, business hypothesis and data points to prove product-market fit. I have no regrets and would change nothing about starting GenM. We learned from our previous mistakes and did things right. ‍",1,0
81," You just have to build stuff and talk to people. You need to find those people to talk to and be sure you want to talk to them. I was selling to developers these are the people I want to chat with all the time. Once you've found a group of people, you can continue building products for them. That is something I just didn't grasp very well before I started. You can look at Quip, for example, which sells toothbrushes on a subscription. They keep adding other products you will eventually need, like toothpaste, shaving cream, and razors, because their subscribers trust them.",1,0
82," If I were starting all over, I would have focused on the consumer market. Specifically, I would have leaned into the community that already loved Graphite—the blockchain community. I think there was a business to be had there, but I ignored it. It didn’t help that I started Graphite at a time when I was reading more and more about how consumer-facing businesses couldn’t be successful, and b2b was the only path to revenue.  With the consumer model comes differences in how you build a product. I would have focused entirely on the documents component for Graphite, done more user research, and built based on feedback not gut opinions.  But most importantly, I would have realigned my thoughts around building a business. I didn’t have a business as much as I had an app. I would make the guiding principle behind Graphite getting it from app to business.  Things may not have ended up differently if I did the above, but at least I would have new lessons to learn and apply next time. To me, that’s what this whole experience is—a series of lessons that can be applied going forward. I’ve already applied many of the lessons I learned from Graphite.   ‍",0,0
83,"  One of the main lessons has been focusing on the customer. That includes the messaging and copy you use on your website and landing pages. Another big lesson is that things take time. Entrepreneurship takes a toll with its rollercoaster ups and downs, but keep on grinding. There was a time when I was listening to a startup podcast where the company had a failed product but they were able to turn things around. At this time we had 0 customers and were about a year into GrowSurf, and all I could think about was how awesome it would be if we could turn things around as they did. The road ahead would be tough ahead, but persistence did pay off.  Building a company is tough. Listening to the anecdotes of other founders is what helped remind me that it’s always tough for everyone as well and there’s no such thing as a free lunch. Look for the stories where it’s not just butterflies and rainbows. ",1,0
84," Stop relying on Upwork/referrals earlier. While they’re both great, they are not reliable. If/when I make this full-time I would want to have an extra layer of security rather than ‘hoping’ I get new invites/leads. When I first started out, I was super scared of not doing a good job for clients. I had ‘some’ experience running Facebook Ad campaigns but was terrified of throwing someone else’s money down the drain. But ultimately this was an unfounded fear. My experience in the digital marketing world helped me immensely and I have (thankfully) never had a case of destroying someone’s ad budget. But at the beginning, I didn’t have this confidence, so I guess I would tell myself to be surer of myself given my experience. Another thing I realized is that many clients sometimes don’t just want the amazing results. They want to feel listened to and like their input matters. Sales are half the battle as a freelancer and it is something I wish I could have realized sooner. ‍",1,0
85," If I could talk to my former self before GrowthMentor I’d tell him to not stress out so much. Everything’s going to work out. Spend more time in the sun, play more basketball, take those Sundays off and just hangout and stuff.   I’d also tell him to completely scratch those “at scale” outbound campaigns I had planned but never actually executed. That was such a waste of time. Let’s be honest, how long does it take to send five super personalized and high-impact emails per day? Maybe an hour on day 1, but as time passes, you’ll get faster and faster since you will be building up a big repo of templates, by month two you’ll probably be able to do 10 per day. That’s 300 emails per month to hyper relevant people that can become strategic partners and who knows, maybe even friends down the road! I know that outbound at scale has its place, I’m actually planning a few campaigns now, but at that early stage, it just wasn’t a good fit. It’s something I wish I knew earlier on. ‍",1,0
86," Hindsight is 20/20, and I’ve been lucky to work with dozens of other entrepreneurs through mvpdevelopment.io, so looking back here’s one idea... At the time, I had no idea what affiliate marketing was, or how referral agreements were structured. What would businesses pay for a customer referral? We should have implemented some combination thereof to gamify our app. Users redeem points for covers, and points could be collected in a number of ways: Eating at a particular local restaurant. Getting your haircut at a particular salon. We could have partnered with those businesses and earned money for every customer we sent their way.Cost-Per-Action offers (CPA offers affiliate marketing). Students take surveys in the in-app browser while in class. We get paid as those surveys are completed.Online deal redemption (Cost per Acquisition offers affiliate marketing). Using incentives (the points) to get students to buy products online or sign up for services. Just like those old ‘free xbox’ websites that made you complete a million different offers - but not as obnoxious. Point economics would be structured such that we make 3x or 4x the actual cost of a cover. That way, bars charge us $5/cover but we make $15 to $20 as a student collects enough points to buy a cover. This solves profit and value proposition issues, but there are a few more benefits: User acquisition costs become nearly non-existent, as the value proposition is much stronger (free covers), and people refer friends to earn points (which cost us $.25 to $.33 on the dollar).We gain leverage in the marketplace. Bars charge us $5/cover in the beginning, but the power dynamic changes when we can control the crowds by (a) advertising or not advertising their deals, and (b) raising or lowering the # of points it costs to buy cover at one bar over another. Lower payment processing expense, and higher margin on cash cover purchases. Who knows if this would work, but the point is that we should have found better ways to leverage the marketplace of users and bar owners AND figured out unit economics early before running out of cash.

87," Definitely, speak to more potential users before building out a full-on platform. I would also figure out right from the get-go if what I was building would be something that people pay for. I think this approach would have led to failing much earlier and allowing me to move on to the next idea! Another approach that I would have taken is from the book Traction, which I mention below. Basically, you spend 50% of your time on product development and 50% of your time on marketing. A good balance of both will get you to where you want - either the next success milestone or knowing that your product isn’t well received by the market. ‍  Here’s what I thought about and learned during the 8 months spent building Gymlisted: 1) You should build the simplest version of your idea and validate early on - We mistakenly thought that getting the “okay” from one person meant that was enough to justify building out a full-on website/product. If I coded up a simple website with the basic functionality first and then use that to validate the idea first, we could have saved ourselves a lot of time knowing if it will work or not! 2) See if there are customers already paying for a similar offering - If there are other products out there that are similar to yours, that is a great sign. It shows that there is a market for what you are thinking of building. The key is finding out how you can bring it to market and if it’s possible given your resources, such as time, capital, and skillset. 3) Know when to cut your losses - We spent 8 months building and trying to promote Gymlisted. We shouldn’t have let ourselves get blinded by the idea, and thought more if what we were working on was a failure. 4) Understand that failing is all part of the process - Coming to terms with a project failing definitely sucked, but it did teach me that all the failures were just lessons for how not to do things in the future! ‍",0,0
88," I would invest in long-term strategies for the company, naming analytics and content.  We refrain ourselves from investing in a well-rounded analytical tool to track user attributes and all the touchpoints they have been through, which later led to our insufficient understanding of our own loyal users.  Regarding content, it’s something I wish I started at the beginning of my journey. Content is more valuable than any lead-generating method I have tried. The LTV of the traffic from content is at least twice as high or even 3 times as that coming from direct store search. In the long-term, evergreen content and still produce tons of traffic without much effort. ",1,0
89," I’d find someone to partner up with. I’m definitely not good at marketing and I most likely won’t become good at it, since I don’t enjoy it. So if I’m ever to do a project like this again, finding someone who compliments my skills to do it with, is a must. I’d also think twice about going into a market so crowded as the habit tracker market. At the time I started programming my app, there was already a good deal of habit tracker apps out there. None of them were to my liking, but a lot of other people seemed to use them. So if you’re making a new product in a crowded market, you better make sure your product offers significant advantages over the other ones. ‍",0,0

94," My main lesson is to work on something you’re passionate about or a problem you have yourself. Headlime solved my issue for being horrible in copywriting. I was my own customer, so I knew mostly what I wanted. I got lucky that others had the same problem I had. Another lesson is to build in public. A product won’t market itself. And a great and easy way to do so is by just sharing what amazing stuff you’re working on. Yes, others might copy you, but is your product actually good if no one wants to copy it?  And the last lesson is to ship often and quickly. The only way to see if there is demand for your product is by putting it in front of customers. Don’t work on something for a year without launching. Put out a minimum viable product. If it has potential, your customers will give you valuable feedback on how to shape it further. ",1,0
95," There are three main lessons I’ve learned since starting Headway.  People are at the center of everything. Being a founder means that you always have to be selling. And not sales in a slimy way. But sales by educating, clarifying, and communicating in a way that resonates with people. I learned if you want to build a business, you have to focus on the people. That means being a person that other people can get behind. Being someone that people want to join and come alongside. And being somebody that people would like to work with, especially in services people buy from people. Understanding how you help other people get what they want enables you to achieve your goals. Being helpful, genuine, and caring about anyone I’ve come in contact with has helped me build deeper relationships and more meaning in our work. Clarity is power. If you're not clear, you can go in the wrong direction quickly. And when things are blurry, it's easier to get off track. So spending the time to work on clarity at every level is going to pay dividends. Because all things evolve, your company, your customers, and how you serve them also change continuously. I’ve learned that you have to strive for clarity continuously. We always need to ask, “where are we now” and “where are we going?” At Headway, we've implemented EOS (the entrepreneurial operating system), which helped give us clarity through cadences weekly, quarterly, and annually. Problems always exist. At first, your issues are massive. As a founder, you’re thinking about leaving your job you’re trying to figure out if anyone wants what you have to offer. As you solve those problems, other problems emerge. You have clients, but not the clients you want or feel you can add the most value to. You have revenue but not enough margins to build the culture and benefits you want. You have people, but ones that aren’t enjoying all of the work you’re doing. The people who join your team and the clients you help on their journey will leave. It’s not an if, but when. As a founder, it's hard not to take either of those personally. There will always be problems, no matter what. If you understand that from the start, you can detach a little bit of emotion and negative self-talk that leads you to question yourself and the journey you’re on. When you’re a founder, and you’re a father or have a family you go home to at night, problems can prevent you from being present. You are more than what you do! All you can do is solve the problem to the best of your ability and continue to move forward with a plan that avoids/solves/deters that same problem in the future. I had a football coach who said the difference between good and great is a thin line that separates who can learn and build upon their learnings after the first lesson.

98," Probably nothing since it turned out great for us in the end. But if we wanted to succeed in the hosting market, we probably should invest in the promotion and hire someone to handle the support so we could focus on promotion and growth. But we wanted to do everything by ourselves and it just became overwhelming.  We learned a lot about hosting, websites and what people actually need and that helped us a lot with our next venture which turned out to be pretty great. We saw what users usually do when starting the website. A lot of them is very lost at the start (especially the ones starting personal blogs). Most of them would just like to blog, but they have no idea how to make the first few steps. And you have to be aware of that when you are selling themes. People don’t just buy themes as a product, they also buy your support and help to get them started. Your help means a lot to most people. And grateful customers are also returning customers.  ‍  Always start with something that you at least like a little. If you hate doing something in the first place and you are only doing it for money, the chances that you are going to build something sustainable is very small. And if you fail you will regret the lost time a lot less if you enjoyed the path. Otherwise, you will just be upset that you lost so much time developing something that didn’t work out. ‍",0,0
99," I would have focused my efforts - user interviews, launch strategy, and product development - on the problem of discovering a local hair stylist rather than the whole experience of finding and getting an affordable haircut.  I learned that my first startup needs to be something with a shorter term monetization strategy so that I can gain confidence in my own development and growth skills before risking several years and a lot of money. I also learned that marketplaces are hard and that I should focus on building something great for customers before trying to get suppliers on board. ‍  It’s easier to build a solution for a problem that is really pressing, something that people are already spending money on and/or searching for on Google. It’s also easier if you build a product either for people like you or for a domain you have expertise in.

I think it is easiest if I bullet point them for easy reading: Pick strategic partnersUse Pinterest moreStick to 1 niche at first (we went really broad and then cut back to gag gifts)Use others (such as influencers) to get your product and store out thereStay committed. I think with most businesses you have to keep going even when you don’t make money. That’s why keeping overhead low is so important.Focus on quality. People want quality and speed, but the quality is always the most important. ‍  I think this goes back to the bullet points in question 8. Keep on pushing. Things may not go your way and you may have bad days or even months, but you have to keep pushing. You never know when a big deal is coming and if you close your business, you are closing your doors to opportunity. ‍",0,0

We were going to build everything in-house and never rely on a 3rd party platform.

I wish we spent less time testing in the beginning.   Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous? As I’ve mentioned before, customer feedback has always been number one.

Everest of issues and tasks to complete, which becomes incredibly stressful.  So, to unclutter your mind, and take it one task at a time, and one day at a time. Make sure you set goals for you and your team to achieve and create weekly tasks that are realistic to be completed.  As you start to see progress internally, you will start to see progress externally such as generating new leads, closing new deals, building long-term relationships, and scaling your business. ‍",1,0

I hate stuff like accounting, legal, and all the minutiae that comes with the business, but after dealing with lawsuits, an audit, and a bunch of other stuff - it’s better to have everything locked up and loaded than be caught with your pants down. Life is way less stressful when you have a lawyer, a bookkeeper, and a CPA that you trust and know your business. Product matters. What problem are you solving? Answer that first. Then build the product from there. So many people build things that are a solution in search of a problem.  Build the audience first. If you’re going to spend a ton of time building a product, you might as well spend half that time first to build an audience. You’ll probably find out a ton of stuff that you didn’t know and they might even point you in a better direction. Plus, when you do launch - you’ll have a built-in set of supporters rather than having to go dig up a bunch of buyers after the fact. This is very on-brand, but the biggest thing I’ve learned from IMPOSSIBLE is that you have no idea what you’re capable of.

Talk to customers.When you start building keep the scope small - shoot to have your MVP done in 1-3 months.

Many startups are fearful about talking about their idea as if it will magically work in someone else’s hands better than yours.

Reach out to diabetic communities to see if they have an interest in juices like the one I made. I would have known people would prefer taking their current medication rather than a juice too difficult to drink. Instead of 3 weeks of mixing juice, I should have spent 3 weeks of market research on juice enthusiasts in Bangkok and validating my assumptions directly with diabetic potential customers. ‍  My main takeaway is to have customers from day 0. Call it pre-launch audience building, content marketing, whatever. It’s about having relationships as early as possible and nurture them. “Solutions do not equal demand. Just because a healthy option is available doesn’t mean that people will choose it.” Make a landing page and see if there's a problem that I'm looking to solve. Many of my ideas will not make any revenue but my cost of starting is zero. I can try out ideas fast. If my ideas fail, it’s fine because I’m not attached to them. We're not the ones to decide if ideas are good or not, it’s the market. Validate your idea. Put it out there and see what happens. If it doesn't work out is fine too, because a lot of successful people failed the first time. ‍",0,0

Sure, that would have resulted in a lot of frustration for customers who would not have been able to change anything in the result, but some people would have been happy with the fully automated results, and we missed an opportunity to make those people’s lives easier. We decided instead to build the editing system because we looked at cloud computing costs and it would have cost a lot of money to produce a lot of discarded results, and we anticipated the frustration of people not being able to tweak something that was automated and almost perfect - but wasn’t. So me personally, I didn’t want us to be thought of as a brand and company that promised customers they would be able to tweak things “soon” knowing that browser based manual editing is a very complex thing to build. “Fake it ‘til you make it” only works if you are providing something with a lot of promise or you have really gullible investors. A lot of the faking leads to dead companies but we get biased when we see the unicorns who used to fake it.  All that said, we would have had paying, or at least non-paying but happy, customers and kept the frustrated people in a mailing list that would be much bigger than the one we have right now. So that’s definitely something we would have done differently if we could go back in time 24 months: communicate really clearly what the tech can do and people who were willing to sift through a bunch of unwanted results would still have found value when our tech got the results right.

114," Gabriel, you need to sort out your execution risk. You don’t have the technical expertise to run all of this so make sure you get the right people to help in time to avoid pitfalls or build a team around it. And focus: make sure that what you are building is the right thing to build, every single day. Build for impact, even if it’s boring. Forget about the bells and whistles! ‍",0,0
115," I’ve always valued my team and their many strengths, but in the past few years, I’ve come to realize just how powerful it is when we work together. There were so many moments that I wasn’t sure if we’d make it. But we pulled through and pushed each other to keep going. I wouldn’t say this is a new lesson learned since launching Kimp, but once that’s been reinforced. Your team matters so much more than your vision. Because without the first the second is going nowhere. Another lesson that I’d say is tied to launching Kimp is around business growth, development, and innovation. In my previous businesses, we were often reacting to our clients’ needs. But with Kimp I’m always pushing to see how we can innovate and optimize our processes and offerings. If we hadn’t pivoted, Kimp would have never existed. And we would have just lost everything after 15 years of running our design businesses. But in going beyond what we thought we could do, we’ve realized more of what we can. And I’m going to keep pushing that ceiling. ‍",1,0
116," No. This was a necessary fail for us. It was a learning experience and it was humbling. ‍   I learned: Always do a SWOT analysis.If there are a lot of competitors, do not let it be the only reason to end the venture. It should be considered in conjunction with other potential issues.Start by implementing the idea with the lowest tech possible to achieve the desired business goals, and start scaling and refining after learning about the particular needs of the customers.A certain level of preparedness and maturity is needed.    I have 3 pieces of advice: Find some to talk to about your idea. Someone you trust and whose opinion you value. Don’t bottle it up inside because you’re scared they’ll steal your idea. They won’t.This might be trite, but make sure to focus on your MVP, and how you can make a barebones version of your ideal that you can bring to market.It is important to really want your idea to succeed, but make sure to make time to be around the people who are important to you and to partake in activities that make you happy. There is no pride in working 80+ hours a week for the sake of working 80+ hours a week.  ",0,0

I could tell him to not launch a new product during a global pandemic but no one could have predicted such a thing would happen.  Kopely was my most thoughtful side project to date.

118," For sure I would grow the team much faster. Obviously, there is some resistance to hire new people when you grow your project. It’s hard to trust others and delegate responsibilities, but so far it has always paid off greatly, giving us a great boost in terms of talent, creativity and results. If I could go back in time, I would do that sooner. We would have grown at least at double the speed! ‍",1,0
119," It’s hard to answer this because this is how most of the people I respect learned the same hard lessons – by giving it a shot. However, in an ideal world, if I could go back with the knowledge I have today, this is how I would’ve gone about executing or at least validating Legaats: I would have started a YouTube channel where I would ask 3-5 families to post videos of their grandparents reciting life lessons and videos every week. This costs $0 and I would have truly been able to emulate the user behavior which is getting people of this age group to interact with technology and document pieces of wisdom. I would have then proceeded to collect arduous feedback on this entire process (i.e. did this make you feel better, how hard was this, etc.) and studied the challenges of getting people in this demographic to interact with technology as a solution to their emotional issues.  To be honest, I can’t tell you more because, with my new mentality, I would have done this long enough to then figure out my next step. It would have been a much more iterative process. I’d have saved tons of money doing things this way and still learned more about my users than what I did in 7 months with Legaats. I would also have focused much more harshly on potential business models before plunging into spending any money on development or deciding to pursue the idea. Lastly, I would have been much more ruthless on detaching myself from my idea. The more I think I can do this, the more merit whatever I choose to do will actually have.    One phrase to all my fellow solo nontechnical founders: ""You don’t need a web app, a product, or too much money to validate your idea."" Everything you’re saying or thinking to convince yourself that you do is not true, and you’ll have a much less painful experience if you listen to what I’m saying. Solve a real problem, and find the cheapest way possible to figure out if people give a crap about what you’re doing and if they’re willing to pay for it. Even with the most techie concepts, you can now build a landing page for free, spend $10-$50 on FB ads, and figure out if there’s demand for the product. You can also leverage tons of other existing technology to help you get you a cheap MVP that isn’t completely low-tech (YouTube channels, email newsletters, landing pages, spreadsheets, free trials of necessary tools, etc.).  ",0,0
120," A common mistake I see in food and beverage startups is an insistence on idealistic assets from day one. People want to get everything exactly right from the jump, even before they’ve tested their product out. If you’re Mark Anthony Brands of Anheuser-Busch, you can afford to spend tons of money on fancy focus groups and killer marketing campaigns even for a brand-new product. But this approach is bound to fail if you started like me with a very limited budget and unproven track record. Scrappiness and ruthless self-criticism can take you a long way. Instead of a full-throttle launch, start small and controlled, leveraging your existing relationships for data collection. This sentiment is especially poignant for F&B startups as I’ve seen countless initial production runs go awry for brands, including my own. Young companies will commit to massive marketing spend and tie themselves to a major distribution partner only to see their first batch of products turn out subpar and, in some cases, unusable. The money is wasted and the distributor drops them, creating a tough situation to dig oneself out of. By placing all your eggs in one basket, you can kneecap your company’s entire future by overcommitting to a certain path when you’re not fully prepared for it in the first place. At Leilo, we always remind ourselves this: “slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.” It is far better in my opinion to exercise patient and cautious spending in these early stages than to go all-in and hope for the best possible outcome, which honestly rarely happens. Focus your efforts on connecting with a reasonable number of individual consumers instead of attempting to conquer an entire regional market all at once. Afford yourself multiple opportunities to make mistakes and learn from them—once you are unwaveringly confident in your personnel, product, and ability to persevere, then proceed at full force. While the cycle of development and redevelopment can be frustrating, you and your company will be better served by it in the long run.  ‍",1,0
121," First, I will try to raise less money and I would try to have a smaller team. I would also have a smaller office. Our idea was to have a larger office so we didn't have to move after one year. It wasn't super expensive, but I would try to be leaner.  Iñaki and I started other companies in the past, so we thought we could build the company smarter and work fewer hours. But if you start a company you have to realize the first couple of years you're gonna work your ass off. You have to put 120% of yourself there. We were not mentally there to do that. We didn't want to. It's not a nine-to-five job. We thought that having senior people will cover the lack of hours. We should have hired the right people for the stage of the company. We hired the right people for the two co-founders at that moment. Finally, I would have introduced a subscription or a revenue model from day one, and not after one year. ‍  You have to be ready to give 120% of yourself to the project. That's going to compromise your personal life, if you're not willing to do so you should not start a company, and it doesn't have to be a startup business. You have to be sure with whom you're doing it. They could be amazing engineers or marketeers, but they could be used to work in large corporations. You need to hire the right type of people for an early-stage company.  You need to start monetizing as soon as possible. You can grow without generating revenue in the US, but elsewhere revenue is key. Generate revenues from day one. ‍",0,0

When starting, I wished I had spent more time on idea validation and understanding the market, and less time on German bureaucracies. I also wish I had spent less time paying attention to the opinion of the first people. I know it sounds quite paradoxical as I am wishing I had spent more time on idea validation. But I now believe that when validating marketplaces, you have to do it in bulk. Maybe hundreds or thousands of people. ‍",0,0
124," I have learned to be resilient above all else. Life as an entrepreneur means people will experience good times and challenging times. They should not rest on their success for too long nor dwell on their failures because neither approach is helpful. Entrepreneurs who want to quit at the first sign of challenges will have difficulty living up to their full potential. I also like to tell young entrepreneurs to believe in themselves and their chosen path. They need to keep moving forward no matter what, even if everyone else around them tells them that reaching their goals is impossible. If I had listened to the negativity flowing toward me when I first started LifeWave, I would have stopped before I started.  I also suggest employees at any company, including mine, should always take the time to hone their skills around the fundamentals. No one should assume they have mastered the basics of any business and they should never stop trying to improve themselves.   ",1,0
125," Being a solopreneur is hard! It feels like I’m doing the work of 5 different people. The product design, the UX, the frontend/backend dev, the promotion… If you use the chat widget to ask for support, I’ll be the one to answer ) Relying on oneself for every single decision is also difficult. I have a couple of entrepreneur friends I could turn to for advice, and there are always the online communities, but it’s not like having partners. There’s a good reason why VCs and business angels don’t invest in solopreneurs, but only in teams with a broad set of complementary skills (something I also learned the hard way). Anyway, I focus on the exciting part, that I’m 100% in control. It’s liberating to accept the full responsibility of my decisions. Another thing I learned is how difficult it is to get feedback. The whole lean startup method advocated absolutely everywhere is relying on this essential thing, getting feedback from your customers. What is not specified is how difficult it is. Nobody has time to give feedback. When was the last time you gave feedback for any of the 10 tools you’re using on a daily basis? Right.",1,0
126," Every day I tweet about a new project that's added to the site, and I do a tear down about what did I learn. The engagement I've got around that has been huge and I wish I would have done that a lot earlier. I didn't grow the top of my funnel, which is my audience, enough in the beginning. People are now discovering me through Twitter. I also wish I would have focused more on what was working. I tried to optimize my website for SEO and I spent a lot of energy. I'm still waiting to get a return on that. I focused too quickly on trying to do a user acquisition strategy instead of just continue to focus on audience building. Staying focused is hard because your time is so limited. I thought that I could do everything at the same time. But I learned to focus more on what was working and then keep fueling that insted of shifting my focus. My biggest takeaway is that even though you have an idea, it's more important to try to find an audience first before you build a product. Instead of selling a product, you should engage with people that have that problem and grow empathy for those problems. These people could become your first users. I failed at that.  It's so easy to fall in that trap because you're so excited to jump in and start building. It's so much easier to show a working product than tell somebody your idea. It's okay to build an MVP. If it's going to take you 100 hours to build, that would be a big red flag for me. With this MVP, potential users can give you feedback and understand if it solves this problem or not. I found that when you create something, no matter how small, the universe responds. Your first users aren't going to expect a polished product. We spent so much time trying to polish a product and trying to get it perfect before we launch it. But if we think about our launches in several micro launches, then you don't need a perfect product in your first launch. On your second launch, which should be to a private beta group, they will still understand if is just a concept.   I've talked to over 100 makers starting a side-project and I've also interviewed dozens. Everything comes down to time and momentum. We're using tactics for startups, and we're trying to apply that to side projects. But those tactics don't work for a side project. You're just trying to test something out. People are getting a lot of false negatives. They ship something and they don't get any feedback or engagement and think their idea sucks. If you have a passion for it because it's going to solve a problem for you, then you know that it's going to be worth your time and you'll be motivated to work on it, and you'll gain momentum to actually ship it. If you don't have an itch to scratch, and you're looking to find a problem in another niche, you need an accountability mechanism. Do you have another person you're checking in to share progress? Are you tweeting about your progress and updates? Do you have a community that can keep you accountable? 100 days of no-code challenge by Max Haining is a great example. I’m in that community and it keeps me accountable. Only when you ship it, you can add it to your resume and to your portfolio.  For my book, I've been waiting to launch the pre-order page because it has taken me a little bit more time to make it. So I first launched a signup page because this gives me a chance to make another announcement to to get momentum. ‍",0,0
127," A few things: The worst-case scenario rarely happens, and when it does, it likely isn’t as bad as you think it’s going to be. The process of starting a business is not difficult. The work isn’t hard. What’s hard is being persistent enough to keep working amidst the ups and the downs. I know very few people who have spent at least an hour a day working on a lifestyle business for two years that haven’t had a certain amount of success. Starting a blog is the most valuable thing you can do if you’re not sure what the first step is. Blogs aren’t dead.

Many times, I haven’t finished a prototype and forgot about the whole idea. But you know what? I would do one thing related to Mangools differently. I would push the whole project more even before it started growing that rapidly. That means I would build the team and delegate tasks a lot sooner than I did. I lost some time by not doing so. When it comes to really helpful things, I would mention my brute-force attitude, namely the focus on quick release to test the market potential. I try to do this every time I can so I basically do a lot of experiments. ‍",1,0
131," Since I started my entrepreneurial journey, one of my biggest lessons is to create a service-based business or an agency. The main reason is that it’s not capital intensive, and you learn how to deal with clients (client onboarding and client service), which is key to building any business. Starting two agencies before my SaaS has been my “MBA” and provided me with a financial cushion to attempt riskier ventures like SaaS. When it comes to starting an idea, pick a niche where you have a specific “insight”.  To take the example of my first business, I started my studies abroad. I knew how hard it was to rent a place. I wished real estate agents would offer video viewings, websites in English, and high-quality photos. That “insight” was my competitive edge (+ the fact that I was way hungrier for money than real estate agents who had been doing that for years).  Now you might think: But how do I get insights? The best way is to start working for someone or hang out in different communities or take a bet on yourself and go abroad. It sounds cliche to say, but the dots may connect later. Today, I am mostly trying to self-improve. Raising funds from Calm Capital was for a financial reason and I also wanted to access their community of entrepreneurs, which are a few steps ahead of me. Twitter (and especially B2B SaaS and Productized services founders) is the way. ‍",1,0
132," The goal of the business should not be about outcomes or exits. Goals should be around building a fantastic product that solves a real business process and building a team that you trust, are confident in, and bring skills that you don’t have or are better than yours. If you’re too focused on the exit strategy, you lose sight of why you’re in business in the first place. We are a lean team, so we rely on a lot of technology to help us save time and make better decisions. Madkudu is one technology that has completely changed how we approach our leads and funnel. They created a model based on our closed-won opportunities, and any new lead that comes in is scored against that. There’s no subjectivity or waiting until we have more data on them. We can act faster and eliminate internal debates about quality.  I like to think about how technology can take a process that takes a lot of time and doesn’t take a particular skill to do. Lead scoring is one of those things, along with personalization and topic/competitive research, among many other things.  We continue to bring that kind of technology into our tech stack and have not regretted it.",1,0
133," I would have pushed harder, earlier. When we first started out, we didn't have a good idea of how big this could be. I had a strong feeling early of a great opportunity this could be but frankly, my partners weren't as sure and we didn't sync up properly. Technology wasn't as focused as they needed to be. Production was working on our wholesale customers more than the e-commerce side. I could see from the digital marketing side that there was a lot of room for growth but it took us about four years to capture that. In the process, we missed the boat on mobile which we are just rectifying with our upcoming launch. These are all big opportunities missed, mostly because we weren't willing to risk and invest like we should have. At the same time, slow and steady has served us well and helped us work out a lot of kinks. I mentioned the Christmas rush and production issues which we needed to work through already, there were many of those types of things. ‍",1,0
134," If I could go back in time and tell the 23-year-old me anything, it would be to be more analytical and be flexible with the model. I would tell myself to really listen to the market, and not be so adamant about proving a point around the sharing economy model. Usually, the best opportunities are just a short shift in trajectory away. We could have easily built companies like Platterz or Cloud Kitchens had we focused on these pivots. Besides that, I think everything I did was a huge lesson. Surrounding myself with smart, hungry (no pun intended) people, was very useful in convincing me that I could do it. Quitting my job and going in full time was the best decision I ever made. Doing the interview, gathering feedback, and marketing the product in the many ways we did was a huge lesson. These learnings were invaluable in my roles following, and also taught me so much about myself. I think you’re truly not learning until you’ve pushed yourself to the extent of your abilities. That’s where the greatest learnings are. Eventually I will start over, and work on a different business that is 1000x better than MealSurfers in every way. I have worked on a number of ideas since, but I am waiting to see what would take off. Also, you always learn more from what didn’t work than what did. This way I have far greater clarity and purpose going forward.  ‍ TLDR: Be more analytical and flexible, pivot fasterBe grateful ‍",1,0
135," Start with an even smaller target market and specific niche. We tried to do too much at once, instead of isolating concepts and fully learning about the implications. This resulted in us touching upon a lot of interesting concepts, but without any real knowledge or conclusions, including but not limited to the following: How much value does reduced time in pre-ordering offer, and how many will plan ahead? If orders are in 1 day vs 6 hours vs 1 hour early, what does that mean for the user and restaurant?Can we further limit drop off locations? What threshold resembles the best balance between market size and trip efficiency?How many extra, unordered meals can we carry? What are the indicators to predict how many people might order if we say ""I'm at location X with sandwich Y, want it""?Would a subscription like MealPal work for these kinds of deliveries?How might a loss leader come into play? For example, if we offered a popular sandwich at a loss, would people add on a pricier desert?Okay... is ""local"" really that important? Form more intimate relationships with restaurants, and have a restaurant expert on our team. I felt like a salesman much of the time. We should have pursued a journey along with them, rather than just have them as a product. Seek out failure, that's when you know you're pushing a boundary and will learn the most. Doing what's safe and enjoyed by many will just keep you comfortable in a local optimum. I wish more kitchens turned me away, so I could have found what fewer owners absolutely LOVE, and commit to, to grow concentrically from there. That goes for users too. Target more specific ethnic cuisines, groups, locations, and restaurants. A good foothold on a section of international students would have enabled us to have more sustained demand for a cuisine further away that is not as accessible to them. In terms of preparing food, much of Asian cuisine shines under bulk preparation as it can be made together, and its quality holds after time. However, something like sandwiches is not as effective, because the preparation effort scales linearly. Team expertise. While I absolutely loved working with my team, we didn't necessarily complement each other's weaknesses or strengths. While we were all smart, and hardworking, most time was spent learning frameworks instead of focusing on the customer product. ‍",0,0
136," That’s a hard question. Truth is, I had no idea how to build a business at the start of this. Since then, I have had time to reflect on a lot of early decisions I made during building MentorCruise, but there are new things I learn every day. I am fortunate that I can reflect on a lot of questions again when I mentor others. The first step in building a business is always to seek validation. Do not start on the solution before you get to know 10 people that would pay to get a problem solved.Your MVP scope should be as small as possible.

Actually, I’d write that on a billboard in front of my window. I also wish I had spent more time speaking with my customers and less time blogging in the beginning. However, this last one’s tricky... let me explain: you’ve got to differentiate between “users” and “customers”, the first ones don’t pay for the bills but the latter do. Once you start getting feedback from your users/customers, you have enough input to start shipping new features every month. However, as I got better as a Product Manager (one of the co-founders should have that role) I became aware that I was bloating MetricSpot with useless stuff that users asked for that customers didn’t actually use, nor were they willing to pay for.

139," From a personal perspective? I probably wouldn’t change much at all. Aged 18, I was working in an industry that I loved. Over the space of 2 years I was introduced, or rather learning on the job, to fundraise, account, develop a brand, launch a product, mass produce a product, and most importantly, to never lose sight of your outgoings. It’s important to remember that when a business fails, it’s not just those within that business struggles, the whole ecosystem around it does too. The investors lose money the small family run suppliers who support you do too. Seeing this happen first hand taught me to be a lot more responsible and thankful. From the business perspective, speaking 10 years on, I would have spent more time researching on the size of the market and realistically forecasting as to how big we could be. Which would result in us being less optimistic with our assumptions. Ultimately, Mongoose felt we could conquer, very quickly, a large share of the market that’s very tough to do. I must stress, that whilst the business was a failure, entering into administration. We did have our successes along the way. The feeling watching one of the World’s best players smash 93 runs in the IPL using your bat was unparalleled. Seeing your brand trending on Twitter, as thousands of people talk about it, gave a sense of pride. Walking up and collecting an award for the best technological innovation in sport, in front of sporting legends such as Haile Gebrselassie and Sir Alex Ferguson, is something I’ll never come close to either.  Business can give you so much to remember, even when it ends in failure. ‍",0,0
140," If I were to do it all over again, I would start a company in a more organic way. I would start by just working on side projects with friends or colleagues. Just nights and weekends to start. It’s totally fine to do a side project while keeping your day job. I’d see if we could first develop some interesting insight, hypothesis, or idea about a market or industry. Then see if we could hack some prototypes together to get customer feedback, customer interest, and – ideally – even pre-generate a sale or two to validate whether the product idea has promise. It’s not important to declare officially that you’re starting a company in the beginning. To be sure, it’s helpful to discuss with your colleagues that that is your desired goal, and to have early discussions on goals and motivations for working together (and potentially starting a company). But in the early days, actually filing incorporation paperwork, etc, is unnecessary. Once you have a good rhythm working with your would-be co-founders and you’ve all tested each other out in terms of interest and commitment level, then it might be worthwhile to start formalizing things into a company. This is because, by this point, you’ll already have a track record of working together and you’ll have a good feel for each other’s personalities and work styles.  Co-founder relationships cannot be rushed. It really is like marrying someone (or a few people). And you wouldn’t get married without dating, right? So, if I were going to start another company, I would “date” first by working with friends or colleagues on informal projects to start, and then discuss along the way and agree on “what would have to happen” to justify e.g. quitting our jobs to take the plunge full time. Lastly, I would spend most of my time investigating a market/industry/customer pain point that I was profoundly, intrinsically interested in. A good way to tell what you’re interested in is to see what you write a lot about (if you journal), or what you read a lot about when you read the news. If you have been consistently writing and/or reading about a topic or industry for more than 2 years, then that is a pretty strong sign you have profound, intrinsic interest in that topic. (Anything less than 2 years is hard to tell, because that could just be a temporary interest that fades away sooner or later). ‍",0,0
141," I would have spent way more time validating the market and gathering a potential customer base. To this day I don't know how big the market was for our product (although based on the success of other similar startups, it looks like it would have worked out). This was a huge learning experience for me – you hear a lot about finding product/market fit and doing validation before starting, but this project really helped me internalize that concept.    Validate your idea first, and if you're not taking funding, make sure you have large margins. I cannot emphasize this enough. If your margins are too small you'll never be able to bootstrap. Specifically, your cost of customer acquisition has to be smaller than your expected lifetime customer value. This is simple stuff, but you really have to always keep it in mind.  ",0,0

While in fact, coworking spaces are businesses, lots of them are struggling to make ends meet. Also, really important is, if you start in an industry with a lot of competition, make sure your product does one thing really well. Don't spread yourself too thin by having many similar features but average executed. And the last thing—something I always struggled with—was to sell the product. Problem with many bootstrappers, makers, and creators are that they think their product sells itself. No, it won't. Running a business is 20% product and 80% marketing. The problem is to most people marketing or sales is seen a sleazy or dirty. But if you look at the most successful companies out there, you see their biggest marketing ""trick"" is providing (future) customers with free, useful and helpful content or resources. One advises I keep to, now too for Muna, is having a post-product-launch plan. This is simply things to do after you have done ""the launch""—in quotes because there will be many little launches over time. It includes blog posts to write, a list of people to contact and other things to keep the momentum going. ‍",0,0
144," As touched on above, a big lesson for me is understanding the importance of work-life balance. My sense of fulfillment or satisfaction in life is derived from a variety of different experiences and learnings, with a career only playing a minor role in that equation, therefore if I get all consumed in work, I won’t be happier, even if my career gets ‘better’. However, I think there are peaks and troughs. Times when you need to lean into work, and others when you lean out of it. So it’s ok to sometimes focus on a career goal, work huge hours and sacrifice other things, but that can’t be sustained in a healthy way for long periods of time. Other than that, three other quick-fire thoughts: Situational awareness is really important. Be aware of what’s going on in other people's lives, how it affects their perception and in turn, you can change how your message is received. The second is to build your business with a team. Another three to four people in your corner makes the hard times much easier. Many hands make light work :) And the third would be to test and learn in the market. Build an MVP, test that your assumptions around what problem you’re solving are correct, and go from there. And get your own data - don’t double down on previous assumptions by taking someone else’s data at face value. ‍",1,0
145," Two key things: I would put much more thought into talking to customers. We relied a lot on our intuition, and it was simple in terms of building features for citizens, but regarding features for governments, we couldn’t guess it right. That seems so obvious now, but we were too focused on nailing the citizens’ side of our product that we forgot about talking to actual clients.Pick key north star metrics from day one. That would make it so much easier to focus on the right initiatives, solve any internal debates, see our client’s success and our progress. These two things are about internal processes, but I believe these are a crucial part of any company building. In terms of strategy, business model, specific features, and more tangible things, I think it’s more important to change process and mindset, and the right plan and ideas would come. We had to change not what we were doing but mostly how we were doing it. ‍",0,0

147," If I could go back to May 2017 and talk to my younger self, I’d tell myself to slow down. I’d tell myself to look at what you’ve already built. Don’t rush to meet your goal of $10,000 income per month, and don’t jump in too quickly. It’s a snowball effect, all this effort you are putting into your current businesses will pay off. Keep doing what you are doing, don’t get discouraged, don’t chase the next shiny object. And ask yourself, is Amazon FBA your strong suit? Or should you stick to your profitable online businesses? What’s the risk of starting an FBA business? Is now the right time, or should you save Amazon FBA for another time? If I could start over, I would choose a different product to launch my first Amazon FBA store. I was in the wrong market for myself, one that I was not familiar with. It was a great learning lesson and a very expensive learning lesson at that. I will be back I will launch another Amazon FBA product. But this time, I know what not to do.  ‍",0,0

149," I did have the chance to start it over with Makerpad. After shutting down newCo, I went away for three months, traveling with my girlfriend to figure out what we were going to do. While traveling, I read the book ""Company of One"" by Paul Jarvis. I learned that there were other people building startups by themselves and had a great living from it. There was something working with newCo. People really liked learning about doing no-code stuff. Assuming that, I kept going with a no-code education service. I launched Makerpad with the same videos I had at newCo. People had to pay for accessing the videos. After looking at what happened with newCo, I learned that you should forget all the platform stuff. I built it myself and that was the easier way for me to service it. ‍  People think a lot about the end goal of what kind of business and don't seem to be realistic about what they're trying to build. Is it a $20,000/month revenue for you and you don't have to manage any employees? That's a great situation to be in. What I thought was if I have 1,000 customers, customer support will be 1,000 times worse than having one customer. And the way I've done things for my customers was to just make sure that it was a fun thing. I got to build new products every day. Some people think that you have to launch something that is really big. That you need to do all these things that don't scale. That you have to talk to people even if you don't like it. “Figure out something that you'd like to do. Keep focusing on that.” ‍",0,0
150," Learn from your members. That’s my biggest takeaway. This is a lesson specifically for community-based businesses, but it’s been a vital one for me. If I started again, I would build a feedback loop directly into the community from the start and follow exactly what our most engaged users wanted. There are subtle differences between different communities and every community is an entirely different beast in terms of how you manage and grow it. Understanding what beast you have is key. And it’s not something you as the founder decide. Entrepreneurs tend to be creative and we have our ideas of what we want to do, but with community building, you need to resist that urge and build what the community want. I’ve had to re-teach myself this lesson over and over with building NCF. ‍",1,0
151," Many of our biggest lessons have been around defining and maintaining processes. We're all smart marketers who have great ideas and instincts. However, defining our frameworks and staying organized can be challenging, especially as we transitioned from an office to a completely remote team. One example would be our project management. We first started using Monday.com, but the tool just wasn't being utilized, as people began just using their own ""to-do"" lists instead. We tried to bring it more to the forefront by integrating it with Slack, but instead, the constant notifications just drove everyone crazy. After some additional testing and research, we made the switch to Notion, where not only are we able to track tasks, but we can design our testing framework, track results and budgets, and consolidate meeting notes. This is still very much a work in progress. We still have a lot to tackle in 2021, but we have already learned that optimizing operations, workflows, and processes is a never-ending job, especially in a professional services business. ‍",1,0

My co-founder and I naively were paranoid that someone would steal our idea.I would have not pursued other ideas for income (music events, blog, etc.) while doing this — this would have greatly accelerated the process instead of dragging it out to eventual failure.

154," Oh wow, So many lessons I want to share here! ‍Be open to opportunities and be ready to get out of your comfort zone. I would never have guessed that our first successes would come from the fashion industry, but that’s how it happened. I remember waking up one day, and realizing that Vogue and Elle were writing about me. That was weird. ‍Timing is everything. So many of the things we did in the early days were fantastic, innovative, wonderful ideas, but the market just wasn’t ready for them and we had to abandon them, but, strangely, things went full circle. Some of the code we wrote for Helishopter, our social shopping app, is in use in Ombori Grid. As I explained above, the Ombori Grid Marketplace is just PresenceKit in a new - and much improved - form. ‍Focus on recurring revenue. Making sales and closing deals is hard, especially for a start-up. If your business model is based on one-off deals, you’re forever chasing the money to pay next month’s bills. Recurring revenue gives you a certain amount of stability. It’s also easier to close deals because there’s so much less sticker shock for the client. Lastly, surround yourself with good people. Not just in your team, but pick the right partners. That’s everyone from outsourcers to PR companies to advisors and lawyers. After all, they’re going to be doing most of the work, not you. If they’re not the right fit, don’t be shy to let them go and find someone else.",1,0

157,"  Easy: quit my daily job, cut down my monthly expenses, apply to a startup accelerator program, get mentors, validate the idea before starting building the product, get advice from reputable mentors in the travel industry and build a strong business model before the 1st line of code.  I learned a lot. Not sure if I have the right words to explain, but I’ll try. I learned how to be efficient, how to leverage tools and methodologies, which I didn’t even know existed, to do my job quicker and better. I learned how cool it is to work with people that are driven and cut the bullshit. I learned how not to give a damn about what people think of me and of what I’m doing, how to do something just because I love to. I learned all the ‘basic’ startup stuff, legal requirement, accountant details, what should an MVP look like, why are people obsessed about Product-Market fit, how important it is to have a strong Business Model and stick to it, etc. Most important I learned how to cool down and control stress.  ‍  My main advice is to avoid staying at home. I mean you can work from home but you need help. Go into a Startup Accelerator Program, learn why others have failed, what have they done wrong (you can use Failory for that), get into the startup community, build your network. Hear what people say but learn how to separate bullshit from good advice. Do your homework, before you build something, make sure people need it, people will use it. Oh! and before I forget, don’t do it if you are not passionate about it.  ",0,1
158," Yes! I wanted to take advantage of being small and, as Paul Graham has famously said, “do things that don’t scale” by really wow-ing the users during the onboarding experience. First, I tried sending a personal email to each person after they signed up. That failed miserably. Maybe it was the copy I used, or maybe I didn’t personalize it enough, but I got virtually zero responses from it. I believe most people thought it was just another automated email. So I started thinking about different ways I could make it 100% clear that this a personalized message from the co-founder. My idea: I would record a short personal video using Loom, introducing myself and thanking them by name for signing up. This made a huge difference! You can’t really fake or automate this, which has led to over a 50% response rate to these welcome videos. People are normally taken aback by the fact that someone took the time to record a personal video message for them. There are 3 great things about this: It starts the relationship on a great note, and lets the user see that there is a real person behind the company.It makes getting feedback much easier. You’ve already opened up a conversation channel, and built at least some rapport. I’ve had people take the time to let me know that they will not be using the service, when they would normally just leave without notice. This has given us the opportunity to figure out what went wrong, or what features they were looking for that we didn’t have.Some people are so wowed by the personal touch that they’ve shared it on Twitter. Here are some of the responses I have received: Recording each video only takes about 15 seconds, so while it may not scale forever, there is no reason why we can’t continue it into at least the near future. This personalization helped us land Nir Eyal as a paying customer. For those that are unfamiliar, Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, which is co-written by Product Hunt founder Ryan Hoover. It helped that I already owned his book and was holding it in the personal video I sent him. He was really blown away by the personal touch, and agreed to give a testimonial that we added to our landing page: ",1,0

It is like reaching out for a balloon, only to push it away with your fingertips. At some point just before park.io, I started to realize that I didn't need anything else in my life to be happy, and suddenly a successful project happened.

Making things cleaner, more understandable, or maybe creating a nicer video, etc. We wanted Kickstarter to be our biggest marketing campaign up to date, and although it still may be the case, I was really hoping it would have taken off.

167," If I could go back in time, I’d tell myself to wait and pick a better idea than doing a Reddit clone with Bitcoin rewards. (Also, it’s a silly name!) I tried reaching out to Ruby on Rails developers who were potentially interested in helping out with Phez development. The idea was that it could power other sites than just the one at phez.co. This ended up being a waste of time. A few guys were interested, but they just ended up kicking the tires and didn’t contribute all that much in the end. If I could do it all over again, of course, I’d just reward users with USD instead of Bitcoin. But the idea that it was Bitcoin (as opposed to just USD) was a pretty core part of the concept. I believe there were already other content networks where you could get micropayments (in USD) for your content. I suppose I should have spent more time trying to market the site. It’s just not my strong suit. I built an entire API for Phez because I had big dreams of a mobile app one day. I don’t think the API had even one single user, ever! Overall, I just invested too much time in this failed experiment. That’s what I regret most actually (the opportunity cost of my time), even more so than paying out some Bitcoins before they rose in price dramatically. ‍",0,0

171," It’s been an amazing 6 months or so since I joined. We’ve done a lot, grown a lot, and made a lot of progress. And we haven’t done any tricks or any hacks to do so. Many times marketing people feel like they’re forced to sell stuff to people that people don’t want and don’t need. And this is completely the opposite.  We’ve spread the word about Plausible and what makes us different from Google Analytics and a decent percentage of people that hear about us connect to that message as it resonates with them and they try out the product and hopefully end up liking it enough that they choose to permanently remove Google Analytics. So the lesson is basically to always start by creating a great product that people enjoy. Without a great product, the marketing, and the growth job becomes so much more difficult and that’s when you get into situations where you need to use hacks and tricks to get some people to sign up as they don’t volunteer to do so of their own free will.  We’re still very early in this process and things have been going so well that it’s too early to zoom out and think about what mistakes we’ve made, what we could have done better or differently, or what we should change.  In general, the big challenge is that Google and the adtech are an ingrained part of the web and how websites are made these days. Pretty much every website has at least one connection to Google and its tools, or to Facebook and other adtech companies. And their tools are all given away to website owners for free. So we are working against the current norm of the web, against free and against the tech giants and that whole cultural and structural thing takes a bit of time to change. ‍",1,0
172," I would’ve begun development in React Native instead of Swift and Java for faster dev cycles. We could’ve iterated a lot more if we had used React Native from the start. Without any animations or UI performance concerns, Playdate would’ve been much better had we started with React Native. I would’ve also grown the team more slowly, and being more discriminating with friends who wanted to help part-time. Counterintuitively, one lesson I learned in people management is that it is far more stressful to manage someone who unreliably does their work than someone who never does their work or always does it poorly.  The quality of our users was more important than I’d thought from the start. Doing things like growing organically but not virally and playing with campaigns like giving out free stuff for downloads meant that too large a proportion of our users were fake or inactive. It was particularly difficult to separate users we should’ve disabled from those who were waiting for new users to sign up in their area. I also put too much weight on special Silicon Valley events like “pitch competitions” wherein you pitch your companies to a crowd of entrepreneurs and investors. This turned out to largely be a waste of time. The time would’ve been better spent on getting user feedback, development, and chasing smart money through my network. We also applied to some accelerators, none of which accepted us. Got some good photos out of it though (notice the original logo!), and I could still see something like this being the positive expected value.  One thing that we were torn internally about and spent far too much time on was our name. Playdate usually evoked a significantly positive or negative response in people, and despite my best efforts, the team kept bringing up the name without good suggestions of replacements. “Playdate” is already a fairly common word so it had unwanted associations and usernames/domains all had to be “MakePlayDate.” In the end, it didn’t matter and it was a curiously emotional matter for people. ‍",0,0

Finally, you must also have the energy and commitment to relentlessly pursue the project until it succeeds or fails. It’s a truism that many viable ideas fail because the entrepreneur simply becomes exhausted. Luckily there are several kids on our team who are far younger than I am and bring great energy and dogged determination to our project. I was lucky to start our startup in Burlington, Vermont, which has a vibrant entrepreneurial community and a terrific maker space, The Generator.

182," Firstly, when you’re attempting to do something realistic, I believe failure occurs only when you give up or it becomes impossible to do so. If I was to start Raw Gains up again now, I’d succeed, and I’d try to loop my Fathom co-founder into it because we work really well together. Here are some loose notes on what I’d do differently Find out if this is a problem people know that they have. If nobody has this problem, it doesn’t matter how many features you have, they won’t use itShip something within 2 months of starting. High value, small feature-setBuild an audience of people who are excited about what I’m makingTechnical debt is fine. Stop worrying about complete test coverage.

183," Well, this is strange but I genuinely don’t want to change anything about my business journey. As I told earlier, we had to face so many struggles in different phases of setting up Rayna Tours and Travels. And what’s amazing is that all of them had only made us wiser and better people. In fact, I am deeply grateful to this incredible entrepreneurial journey which has helped us to bring the best out of us.  ‍",1,0
184," Honestly, not much in the early phases. I really did do a lot of stuff right. I still would have built a prototype, I still would have reached out to a ton of people, I still would have gotten it to the “almost working” stage. What I would have done differently is simply listen to the audience more and be more honest with myself about what they were saying. Interestingly, this lesson has already served us well. Around the same time as Readership, we were also launching a platform called Hemlock that lets marketers visualize other companies content calendars. In Hemlock’s case, people were actually paying for it. But within months of launch our churn was through the roof. Nothing we did seemed to help. But Patrick was really diligent at following up with each cancellation and talking with them about why they left. In every case, people said, “Well, I loved the tool, but I got everything I needed from it within the first month or so. I just don’t need it anymore.”  No matter what features we added, we kept hearing this story. Granted, it’s after people pay us something, but we need 6-12 months from a user for it to work, not 1-2. So we’re having those hard conversations about “do we keep going and try to fix this or cut our losses and focus elsewhere?” It’s tough to let go of something you’ve worked so hard on, but knowing we made the right call with Readership helps us have a bit more confidence in that regard. That’s part of the reason we’re really focusing on SendView right now. The market loves it, they’ll pay for it, we love what it does for our own marketing efforts and, most importantly, users stick around for 10 times longer than with Hemlock. There’s a lot of debate around whether you should just focus on one product or put a few eggs in the basket. In our case, we started with a few but are slowly honing in on one because the lessons that prevent the others from scaling. ‍",0,0
185," If I was just to do a dropshipping business, I would not do it in anything political. That's for sure. I still think that niche is good. Because going niche means you have a more defined audience. Once you have that audience defined, it's a lot easier. “I'd go a lot heavier on the marketing, especially in terms of just building out that community by email and automating a lot of processes.” In terms of RealityHunt, my approach would be using no-code tools. Building it with Webflow and Integromat and put it all together. I would try and build a list of people that are interested in the project to validate my hypothesis first. Build a landing page stating I'm going to build this and if you're interested sign-up. When you hit a certain KPI, which could be 100 users or 50 signups, that becomes the trigger to fully build it. I'm applying that process to a different set of projects I'm working on right now. Just to see if people are interested. If I get people behind it and they're already interested, it makes sense to go ahead and try those projects out. ‍  Build processes that simplify your way of working. For example, I have a Notion template. Whenever I have a new project, I just click on one button, and my Notion page for that project is set up. I have all my finance structure, my key development links, my API key page, and everything already prepared. It saves me a bunch of time. “Build a simple landing page and just test out your idea on paper before you commit to building it. That will save a lot of time.” Don't be afraid to get feedback. Just talk to users and figure out what they want instead of what you have in your head. The product development side of getting feedback is not about the best solution you have in your mind. It's about what the customer wants. If they want to have a bit more of this and a bit more of that then go ahead and build it. ‍",0,0

I went in with a ton of assumptions based on my experience of one person (my dad!) and didn’t do a great job getting into the community to see how people were solving the problem. I’d also try many small experiments in the space instead of focusing on one approach, to begin with. It took a year from when I first had the idea to when I had something people could use. Because of the long-time investment in one vision of the product, I was so attached to the path. ",0,1

188," Pick up a large market that you understand. Solve a problem where you know who the user is. Solve hard problems for the long run. Assume your user to be a layman. If you can acquire the most layman-ish user, you have made an easy-to-adopt, useful product. And if it is useful and easy to adopt, it will gain traction. Listening to your user. While building a product it is very important to remove our personal bias and focus on what the user wants. Being agile to make quick changes. Being consistent in your efforts. Keep ‘execution’ as your business Mantra. I believe execution is the Holy Grail and the most underrated part of a business. A lot of companies do better than their counterparts just because they execute well. The most important lesson learned as a person is to surround yourself with the kind of people you want to be. If you surround yourself with hardworking and successful people, you become one. ‍",1,0
189," In my previous answer, I called out the importance of patience and managing growth properly. Looking back this also would have been an important knowledge set when I started the business. I should have been 100% sure of the model, design, and functionality before development of the platform started. It’s a fine balance between getting a product out to market as quickly as possible vs taking a breath and analyzing key decisions more. On the flip side when you start seeing a product being created, new ideas pop up which warrant a change.  I would additionally tell myself to discipline my despair. When there is negative feedback for your business or certain client conversations don’t go as well as you planned, it’s easy to get bogged down and get the feeling that momentum is slowing down.  Downers are part and parcel of business. The ability to overcome them and improve quickly I found a massive advantage.   ‍",1,0
190," Make friends with your customers, period. The more you talk to your customers, the better you'll run your business. Talk to them frequently to see how they are doing and find out their pain points. If you provide them a solution to all their problems with your product or service, you've gained a follower that will tell others about you. Use the organic approach and let your customers be your voice it's the best way to capture the hearts and minds of everyone you want to do business with. ‍  If I had the chance to go back, I’d probably do it all over again! The journey we’re taken so far as a team has been an incredible one, and I’ve learned a lot from the experiences I’ve had. Everyone faces challenges, sure, but I believe that those challenges are what help you refine yourself and become truly special. After all, even coal turns to diamond after tons of pressure. There are a couple of things that I would have altered in my journey, had I had the chance to go back. I think greater foresight would have really been helpful, and being able to assemble my team faster would obviously have been great. But the way the journey has turned out so far, I feel the best is yet to come. To my younger self, I would say this: keep going, tiger! Keep pushing forward, keep following your passion obsessively, and never look back. The world is so much bigger than what it seems right now, and you’re on the right track to make it big. Always remember where you come from, and never forget to be thankful for everything. ‍",1,0
191," First of all, I would include fewer features in REPitchbook’s MVP. This would allow for fewer, more polished features, resulting in a less confusing, more agreeable experience. Second of all, I would talk to customers (and perhaps sell to customers) before writing any code. Talking to customers helps you prevent wasted effort and develop a product your customers want in less iterations.  Finally, I would spend WAY MORE time working on the design of the application. This experience taught me that, to your user, your design is your product. Said another way, if your UI / UX makes your user feel stupid, your UI / UX is stupid, and users won’t want your product. ‍",0,0
192," If I had to start over, I would do less with more. At Reroute Lifestyle’s launch, I wanted to have multiple opt-ins, and 8 different posts in multiple categories. Instead, I wish I: Outlined one specific transformation to offer readers,Created one mind-blowing opt-in (instead of several),Written a few in-depth posts optimized for engagement and sales. ‍ Even though it took us a month to put together Reroute Lifestyle (at the time, I worked at my day-job on the side), I wish I took a step back to focus on creating LESS content (posts & email opt-ins) with MORE value. ‍",1,1
193," As a solo founder, I know it can be extremely overwhelming to think about creating a profitable product when just starting, but instead of giving advice, I´ll tell you what worked for me. I´m not a “proper” developer. I'm more like a designer who knows how to code, so it was natural to underestimate myself and to think small when I started building ResumeMaker.Online. It sounds counterintuitive, but while working on it, ending up earning money never crossed my mind. In retrospect, I think this undisturbed and humble approach to just try and design a useful product was key to avoiding frustration, not biting more than I could chew, and ultimately shipping the product. ",1,0
194," I would keep the product the same and maybe target a different user base. I would target small businesses as a remarketing channel. I would try to make it a Twitch plugin so it could be it could pop up on the stream. It would remove the barrier experience where people are hesitant to give away their phone numbers. ‍  The biggest takeaway from my experience is that you don't need to spend months planning out an MVP. “You can build an MVP in a week and focus on getting validating it.” When it comes to building a startup, focus on what you know, or what you have an audience for. I was able to test out RingDaddy very quickly. I knew it didn't work within a month, so I didn't waste a lot of time on it. I was able to do that because I knew that I could get streamers rapidly on board. “Think of problems for things that you know, subjects that you know.” I have two other failed startups. It took me 4-6 months to build each and they took a lot more resources. It's helpful to focus on simpler ideas and key things that differentiate your product. RingDaddy was two different forms, one of which lets you collect phone numbers and the second one, which lets you send out texts to the phone numbers you collect. That's the entire product and that was enough to get some revenue and to get people signed up. ‍",0,0
195," Every startup is different. Tactics and strategies that work for one may not work for another, even if the businesses are incredibly similar. We initially thought SEO would be our best tactic for growth since it's an ""obvious"" choice for the type of tool we're selling. It turned out to be the hardest for us to break into and gain traction. We also didn't expect using influencers would be something that worked as well. I think for startups, you simply have to try many different approaches and tactics yourself, learn from them, then refine or change your approach. There's only so much that other people can do to help you grow. ",1,0
196," Think smaller, for sure! Finding a good market-fit early on would have helped a lot: not only on the sales and printing side but also on the business plan (which, of course, I didn't have). ‍  There are some things you can learn by reading, but there are others you have to experience by yourself, even if those don't end up where you wanted. Having failed to achieve the goals with Ropero, I found that selling physical products is hard (and perhaps, not for me?), so I'm now focusing on a SaaS model. Also, when you're selling B2C, you'll have to sell a lot to break even, and it means convincing a lot of people for a product that maybe they don't think they need it. Meanwhile, on B2B you can earn a living with just a handful of clients, although their requirements are radically different. From these, and many other experiences, I've learned a lot: what MVP really is, how to negotiate, the channels to market your product, finding good partners, why UX is important, and even how to build an e-commerce site! So yeah, go ahead and start something. I bet you won't regret it. ‍",0,0
197," Every day comes with a new lesson and I am learning a lot. And, when it is about Salonist, my main concern is improving its outreach. So, I prefer to communicate with the customers whenever they have questions or some maintenance issues. It is important to keep a regular follow-up with them to know if they are satisfied with what we are delivering or they need some improvements. I schedule meetings with the team members every week to integrate and implement new ideas to Salonist. Above all, to carry out every single task correctly, time management is necessary and I am keeping it at pace.",1,0

199," One of the biggest lessons I have learned from my time with Scraper API is that patience and a supportive team are vital to a successful acquisition and transition period. Even if you feel like you have all the information in the world about the business you’re acquiring, there are many unknowns and surprises to continuously work through. If you’re part of a great team everyone can help each other out, which helps everything come together faster. Luckily we took over the team too during the acquisition, and we could rely on their vast knowledge of the domain. Since I've mainly worked with enterprises in the past (LogMeIn, T-Systems...etc), a lesson I have also learned is that startups that got momentum early on have a lot of skeletons in the closet, that you have to either learn to live with or dedicate time to work through them. Scraping is a constant cat and mouse fight - it’s a bit similar to what advertisers and ad-blocker apps do. The technology we build is unbelievably advanced when it comes to staying on top of the newest blocking techniques the cat-mouse fight was a manual thing in the past, but we are building newer, more autonomous ways to stay unblocked.",1,0
200," If I had the chance to talk about my 5 years ago self I think I would tell him not to do a price monitoring application, to begin your web scraping stuff as soon as possible AND to be really careful about brand names.

201," If I could give myself a big talking to, I possibly would have delayed starting Scream Pretty until my children were older, as I feel my work life balance is a little work heavy BUT, I love it, so maybe I wouldn’t have listened! I would also have tried to find a PR agency to help me place my jewellery into the hands of stylists so that we could get more coverage in the press, to boost our initial launch. We have found doing pop up shops a great way of testing our designs, before launching them on the website and incurring the cost of photography and uploading. I wish we had done more pop up shops prior to the launch, then some designs wouldn't have made the final cut. I would highly recommend this route for all e-commerce channels - if your customer doesn't like a product, don’t move forward with it! ‍",1,1
202," I wish we had focused on the marketing of our product earlier. We spent way too much time trying to find product-market fit, building features that never gained enough traction. Everyone keeps saying that SaaS founders should talk to users daily while looking for product-market fit, but I would say you have to talk with your paying customers if you already have them, not with users who just haven't started a trial or churned in a few days. What did your paying customers find useful in your product? How do they use your product? SEO tools are a very competitive market, and if someone is telling you that your product is missing few features, most likely even if you build those features they will never pay for a subscription anyway. Be aware of tire kickers requesting features! For example, we’ve built an API for Seomator and it took a bunch of time and money in development and product support, but very few customers are using it. If I had a chance to do things differently, I would cut out a lot of features that we’ve built into our product. ‍",1,0
203," Well, I have indeed started over but with a different product! I am doing many things differently, in particular, I am paying a lot more attention to the three points above. If I had a chance to go back in time and work on Sharkius again, I think this would have made all the difference. Other things that I have now done differently that should apply to any startup: Find a co-founder as early as you can. Co-founders can make a huge difference. It took a while for Sharkius to have someone who basically became a co-founder, he was great but it was a bit too late. At Chessable, this was arranged before day 1! This is why some accelerators and investors do not invest unless there are two of you. You should also get a more experienced entrepreneur to be your advisor and mentor. This way, you are accountable to someone else other than yourself. If anything else, knowing you have to meet with them keeps you working at the best of your ability.  ",0,0
204," I wrote a blog post outlining my vision for the next Siempo, detailing all the things we might do differently. On the product side: • Research — We conducted several rounds of user research, but we always could have done more to validate real human needs vs. what we imagined would be supportive. This is tricky for a problem with such a complex system of root causes. It has to do with the user’s awareness of their emotional state and their digital environment. • Simplicity — Because we initially set out to build a whole new phone, we had thought through many aspects of the user experience at the OS level. When we pivoted to software, we transferred much of that feature set into the launcher. A more straightforward feature set may have been more effective for user adoption than the complex set we released. • Onboarding — There is a big learning curve for switching to a whole new interface, especially for those who have never used a launcher before. We prioritized investing in a smooth onboarding experience, but it proved insufficient and led to a loss of many users upon download. There was ample low-hanging fruit to tackle to improve retention. ‍",0,0
205," My main takeaway since starting SimpleLogin has been to focus on the product and don’t rush it. Release early is good but there’s a line between viable (as in MVP) and unusable.  You probably heard that already a thousand times but let me repeat it: talk with customers. That’s the only way to learn how people use the product and improve it. One way to get in touch with users is to send transactional emails from a real address (and not a no-reply one) so anyone can just reply to talk with you.  Another lesson I learned is to ignore haters. There are always people who somehow hate you and your product so much. Ignore those, don’t fight back, and just move on.  I’ve been extremely lucky to have people around who don’t care or understand about SimpleLogin but are willing to support me nonetheless. Having support is important as there were low moments where it felt there was no outcome for the product.  ‍",1,0
206," If I had to start over I would have done more research first. I would have conducted interviews and held information sessions. I engaged my target customer too late and did not address the critical features first. I should have focussed on a minimal MVP and then iterated based on feedback. While I did develop a bunch of features, they were not the most important ones. The time spent on infrastructure should have been on the back side of the process, not the initial step. ",0,0
207," Build trust from authenticity. Even before launching your product/service. Trust is your most valuable asset as an entrepreneur. Start sharing your journey with others. Start your small audience. Share the good but also the bad. Don’t be afraid to show yourself vulnerable sometimes. People will relate. One-person business does not mean any collaboration. It took me a while to learn that I had to delegate and outsource some of the work that I was doing to focus on the things that I did best and will make SinOficina grow. I now work with 2 other freelancers that are better than me in what they do. Surround yourself with formidable people. There's a well-known proverb that says «if you want to go fast, go alone if you want to go far, go together». That is a good reason to be part of SinOficina but also is something I did to create it. Having a solo project doesn't mean you have to walk the entrepreneurial path alone. There's much to learn from others apart from the ones who write books. ‍",1,0
208," Given the opportunity again and starting this next business I would: a) Focus on Cash: Align operating budget with cash on hand not based on accounts receivable or accrued revenue. I would have also increased our credit limits well before we needed it. I’m definitely not as scared of debt as I used to be, I view it more as a tool to manage cash and grow during a start-up.  b) Pivot fast, but ensure that you have the money to pivot. We decided to exit for several reasons, the risk increased considerably once the pandemic hit, and there is no equity in a non-profit. In a for-profit, the strategy may have been different, but this was reality.  c) Recognize when to hire staff and when to hold off. Hire slow or not at all. We got so much pressure from the staff, parents, and students against remote learning and the “walls of a school” we caved. This led to high overhead in areas when maybe we shouldn't have. We certainly didn't know how quickly the learning environment would have changed to move online, the pandemic only accelerated it.  d) Build means to track progress, measure, and manage. Data always shifts through growth, so just ensure metrics are aligned with the mission. Set aside time to do high impact projects, like managing an operations dashboard and sharing it with partners, staff (if you choose) or investors. Don’t add a middle manager out of the gates to manage the metrics, or prepare to have your vision sidetracked. e) Develop personal boundaries. Don't give up more than your future self is willing to. This time around, I am thinking more carefully about the sacrifices I am willing to make for success. I am envisioning what my life will look like when it does succeed. I want to ensure I have the proper time for my family and friends, my husband and my son, and do the things that I want to do, like see more of the world and make some positive change while I’m at it. I’m creating a business that will fit my lifestyle today and will grow and easily adapt with my projected lifestyle 5-10 years from now. ‍",0,1
209," After failing on my first few indie projects, I’ve found that starting small is the key. For me, getting the product in front of customers was so critical to our early growth. They gave us valuable feedback and helped make sure we were on the right path. The version of SnapShooter our customers use today is very different from what it was when it first launched, and that’s good.  Second, I would say take the time, even early on, to do customer research. From surveys to customer interviews, it’s all critical data that you can use to help guide your work. Michele Hansen at Geocodio is doing a fantastic job in this space right now. Her book (and website), Deploy Empathy, is great. The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick is also an excellent book about talking to your customers.  Finally, I’ve learned so much about the legal side of the business. It doesn’t get talked about much, and I get that. It’s expensive and tedious, but it’s so critical. Once you have some product validation, it’s crucial to work with a lawyer to review your work. Everything from your terms and conditions, privacy information, and branding/trademarks are important to get right. Unfortunately, I had to issue a cease-and-desist letter to a competitor that launched a product with a very similar name to ours. What could have been a nightmare was resolved quickly thanks to ensuring all our legal ducks were in a row.  ",1,0
210," I would tell myself that everything takes time. I am an extremely goal-oriented person. So if I am not hitting my targets, I get discouraged.  Many people have told me to take my time, that I’m moving too fast, and that I’m not doing it the “traditional” way. I’m very happy that I’ve never listened to them. If I did, I would have delayed the “failure”, lessons learned and experiences by months, if not years. Moving fast is good, at least it was for me. I would also tell myself to stop thinking that everyone is smarter and better than me. Everyone gives contradicting advice, and it’s up to the entrepreneur to be able to build their own filter system. I learned that not everyone’s intentions are always good, and if they are, that doesn’t mean that they are completely right. And advice is such a subjective matter. ‍",0,1
211," I’ve learned a ton from Software Ideas. It’s hard to put into words. Here are some key ones: It took me eight months to get CoderNotes.io to $50 revenue, and I worked just as hard or harder than I have on Software Ideas, which hitted +$4,000 in a quarter of the time. The market and idea you choose matters.Writing a paid weekly newsletter is an exercise in discipline. You don’t get any weeks off, and you better make sure that you deliver a high-quality issue each week. While the opportunity for recurring revenue is great, you need to be prepared for what you’re getting into with this business model. And some personal ones: It’s really, really hard to celebrate milestones. I’ve struggled each time to take a step back, breathe, and enjoy myself. I have to be intentional in rewarding myself, otherwise I never take time to enjoy the spoils of my efforts.Starting a company comes with a lot of anxiety, stress, and even depression. I thought these things were at their worst when you aren’t successful, but the more successful you get, the further you can fall, and the more those negative emotions weigh on you. Focusing on your health and mental well-being is key, and something I need to do better on. ‍  I think I’ve done a decent job in my first two months, and it’s probably too early to answer this question correctly. But the main thing I would do is to tell myself to be prepared for the content mill. It’s incredibly challenging to keep up a high-quality, deeply-researched publication without help. And I would want to prepare myself for that. ‍",1,0
212," I wouldn’t make it a gambling service. We would have gone down a freemium app route of some sort, allowing us to get users from all around the world, not just the UK. It would have made getting users easier, reduced our costs and possibly completely removed the need for investment. ",0,0
213," The first thing I would do differently during the campaign is focus more on our media. We had a great product, but I felt like our video and photo efforts didn’t get the point across as well as it should have. We live in a society now that is completely focused on visuals, and text explanations only go so far. We have since focused more on our branding and now that we have officially launched, I am satisfied with the direction we are going. On a similar note of things I wish were done differently for launch would be to include press more seriously. I do wish that I had more initial production samples created that could be sent off to press, because I found that they really are interested in even the smallest of startups or companies, but I regret not taking it seriously enough or including it in our marketing plan as prominently. On the contrary, the one thing that I felt like I spent too much time on was on the small things that didn’t directly correlate with selling the product. I do like to work into the future, as I call it, where what I am working on today is really applied for some time down the road. The issue during the Kickstarter was that I got into that mood and started to work on things that would apply after the Kickstarter was funded. If I were to go back I would have focused all of my efforts and crushing the funding goal as quickly as possible, instead of putting efforts elsewhere. All in all, if I were able to go back, I would tell myself to do these changes. I believe that we didn’t fund as successfully as we could of due to lack of press coverage and good media to showcase the product, as well as spending too much time on the small details that didn’t convert to direct sales at the start. ‍",1,0
214," Some people advocate starting to charge from day one. We didn't follow that practice. During the beta, our product was free to use. That decision had its advantages and disadvantages. We attracted more signups that way, but we also had users that weren't ready to pay at all. Sometimes their feedback was distracting and demotivating. So next time I would start charging users earlier to get feedback from real customers.  ",1,0
215," Lesson 1: Be good at differentiating perseverance from insanity.  This is best captured in this quote by Andreessen Horowitz:  “Entrepreneurial judgment is the ability to tell the difference between a situation that's not working but persistence and iteration will ultimately prove it out, versus a situation that's not working and additional effort is a destructive waste of time and radical change is necessary.” Regularly ask yourself whether you are falling in one or the other category. This “never give up” mantra you hear everywhere from all these “self-help” gurus is truly harmful. Sometimes it’s best to just let go and seek a different path. That’s what our pivot meant for us. And it’s especially hard because that “sunk cost fallacy” is deeply rooted in our primitive human brain. Lesson 2: Be a pragmatic optimist. That sort of links to the first lesson and it’s a more personal take on it. There is one quote from a US naval officer who survived 8 years as a prisoner during the Vietnam war, that stuck with me: “You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end — which you can never afford to lose — with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.” It simply means being a “pragmatic optimist”. It does sound quite paradoxical but that’s the only way you can build a business and stay sane in the process in my opinion. An optimist who can’t face reality will fail to learn lesson 1. A pragmatic without any optimism whatsoever will just give up whenever it gets too hard. Easier said than done but a healthy dose of both is what I’ve learned you should aim for.  ‍",1,0

218," SwagUp is such a complex business with so many different components, like running a fulfillment center, building technology, running a sales team, partnership and channel development, product manufacturing, integrations… there are so many different facets of what we do.  If I had to break it down into two core lessons it would be: Never lose the penchant for action. Keep things moving constantly, always seek to improve and iterate. Get things done quickly and often and keep pushing things forward. Make sure that you instill this dynamic in all future hires so they carry it forward with them. Avoid bureaucracy and hypotheticals that slow decision-making.Hire incredible talent as early as possible. Bringing in great talent compounds. The earlier you can do it the better. They will set up strong processes, they will get the job done well, they will find other amazing talents, they will build their mini-empire. Find these people ASAP and don’t try to cheap out here. I like to spend a decent amount of time on Twitter, it’s the top of the content funnel for me. I find a lot of interesting people, podcasts, blogs, articles, books, etc through Twitter. I have an insatiable curiosity that sends me down rabbit holes that helps me expand how I think about things. Much of the problems businesses face have been faced and even written about. The greatest minds are always sharing their knowledge, you need to go out and get it and then do something about it.  Twitter is also great for finding like-minded people and other founders at your stage to stay up to date with and help each other through similar phases of the business.

219," I wouldn’t change anything. I am grateful beyond words for having been given the opportunity to go through this. But here are some advice I would gladly give the 23 old Stefan: Always think of the clients first and how you can serve them bestStay true to who you are and your values.Don’t skip steps. Build it slow. Build it steady. Most of the competitors in our space don’t necessarily have the best products, they simply have persevered the longest.Be patient. Set clear goals and strategize to achieve them.Done is better than perfect. Put things on the market fast and learn. ‍",0,0
220," Having the wrong goal is more important than having no goal at all. Trial and error is essential to any business. I always laugh at the time we first launched Swoop with the ""Uber for groups"" business plan. All of the Saturdays we stayed up through the night, continuously refreshing our dispatch page to see if any ride requests came through, and if any did, someone would sprint out of the office to grab the vehicle and pick up the customer. We would do 15+ rides in a night with 3 party buses on the road and we thought we were studs. It was nuts. Would it have been an advantage to have started developing the marketplace before an on-demand service? I honestly don't think so. We learned so much about the industry and what it was like to be in the field. Having face to face conversations with customers and hearing their feedback was essential. The lessons learned during that year were more useful to the future of Swoop than getting a head start on our current business model. It created better relationships with the affiliates we work with and drivers on their roster because we had seen almost everything. The time we spent formulating our old business model became the foundation for the Swoop culture we take so much pride in today.  ",1,0
221," I went on to found and lead a second entrepreneurial venture: a drone-focused software development team inside the Department of Defense called Rogue Squadron. This felt like such a gift because I was able to leverage everything I’d learned from the nonprofit. We had real resources. Our team grew to about 15 full-time people. The team was a brilliant success in two years we became one of the most capable small drone teams in the United States government, and we supported hundreds of government organizations with our capabilities. My biggest lessons were deeply personal. Failure hit me hard it took me about two years to recover, and I still have scars. That gave me a lot of time to contemplate the lessons, especially since I was writing my book. First, I learned to be much wiser and more careful about my own entrepreneurial passion. Entrepreneurs tend to be hypomanic we pour our hearts and souls into things and then ride out debilitating crashes. Now I throttle my energy to maintain a marathon pace. I have organized my life around strong boundaries and self-care. I work extremely hard but my typical day also includes time with my family, exercise, adequate sleep, journaling, pleasure reading, and meditation. I try not to let my sense of self-worth become too entangled in my entrepreneurial pursuits, although this is admittedly a challenge.  Second, I now take a much broader view of success and failure. Innovation is so nonlinear the economist Joseph Schumpeter described capitalism as “gales of creative destruction.” We try stuff, the main effort goes sideways, and then unexpected seeds we planted along the way suddenly bloom. My nonprofit failed but we helped start a conversation in the humanitarian assistance world about drones for good my volunteers went on to do amazing things in the drone industry I leveraged my expertise to launch Rogue Squadron.  In my book I write: Each action you take plants seeds in this wild, vibrant, evolutionary jungle. Every investment in a colleague or subordinate could shape that person’s life. Your discarded creative projects become building blocks for the next generation, or for your own future efforts. Work you abandoned will surface in entirely new places, changed and yet mysteriously familiar. Lessons you learned long ago will help you avert catastrophic mistakes in the future.  This view of the world becomes almost comforting. You are not such a big deal after all, and that is okay. You faithfully play your part in the cosmic symphony. You make investments, plant seeds, and cast your bets on steps towards a better future. How much you plant will define your legacy. ",0,0
222," I’ve learned that you need to test things even more than you think you should. It’s why the Cynefin decision-making framework, in particular fail-safe probing, has been a big part of my journey at Tactiq.io. It's how we prioritize our product roadmap, run growth experiments, and bring on contractors/freelancers.  The other thinking I’ve adopted is team-product-fit. Our team DNA is product-led growth, just like our business/GTM strategy is product-led growth. Everyone has worked at product-led growth organizations, or they deeply understand what being product-led entails. This alignment between business strategy and team aptitudes means our team is always aligned. There’s no confusion on direction, roadmap prioritization, etc.  ",1,0

This could have given us the option to pivot and focus on a different industry with potentially more growth potential and initial traction. I would have focused less on voice technology as the core of our product. Ultimately, our product was not able to meet the expectations of our users because the voice technology we were leveraging just wasn’t where we needed it to be so we could be successful.

Be fearlessly data driven. Search for true market validation from consumer or business demand, and work until you have the numbers to prove it. Don’t work on ideas aimlessly, work on an idea that arises from a pain point that you truly believe in.

228," We should have focused on validating the market first - i.e. whether people would be interested in help with medications beyond those already using basic reminder apps, and if so, how we could reach them. Just because the problem exists doesn't mean it's ready to be solved. Relatedly, on the product side of things, we should have been more concerned about how our product would encourage adoption - not just efficacy. Medication adherence is hard because many people don’t really care too much about their medications, and the benefits of taking them are usually far in the future (e.g. taking meds now will reduce the risk of heart attack later). That means a tool that helps people take their meds won’t naturally produce any sort of “aha” moment until much later, if at all. We should have spent more time figuring out how to quickly show a person why medication adherence matters. There are a few techniques that we could have explored, like providing financial incentives (perhaps from an enterprise partner) or being more deeply integrated with healthcare systems. ‍",0,0
229," I wouldn't do a marketplace business again. With my new business as an agency, we have a skill, we sell it, people pay for it. There's no managing a supply and demand side. I would also have focused on online lessons. We focused on matching people that wanted language lessons in person. But there are lots of logistical issues there. In a big city, you might have a student in one part of town and a great teacher in the other. They might be a great match, but they're not going to travel for one hour to see each other. We weren't even covering a whole city. I’ll focus on a marketplace business where the supply and the demand were online, and there was no managing the logistics of that. ‍  Just start and start simple. We started without automation. It was just me managing every request we got and finding teachers. ""Every business could be boiled down to something really simple."" You're not going to lose any money building a business like that. You might not make any money but if you do, that’s a great situation to be in. Keep your costs less than what you're earning. Don’t get into debt. Don't depend on the business. Build out the business by reinvesting your earnings. As you start to earn more, you can invest in more apps and more automation, but always keep it in perspective. Think very carefully about marketplace businesses. Most people start these types of businesses because they've realized they've got a supply or demand for something and they just assume they’ll be able to match that up. But quite often, it doesn't work out that way. ‍",0,0

If you put your energy into process improvement, you get more efficient operations. Whatever you do not focus on will slowly fall apart. Each area of the business is like a garden. It needs constant attention. Without it, problems grow and become more urgent until you are overwhelmed by them. We are big believers in building our own software. This gives you complete control over your operations. You can make the software reflect how you want to do things, and this can be a huge differentiator from your competitors.

We have started working on the product without gathering enough “intel” from our audience and actually make sure that it is a real pain for them and they do see the value of our solution. Because we are developers the easiest part for us is the actual execution so we just jumped into it as fast as we can, even though we knew that the validation and market research part is crucial.

Same with business: you can learn how to run a Google Ad, but you need experience on how and when to launch such an ad. No one knows when your particular project needs this.  And you yourself will not know until you spend a few grand either. This is why I encourage you to try and fail, try and fail.  Watching smart videos may feel like progress, but without actual practice this is nothing but old good procrastination. ‍  There is one thing that I’m missing and it can not be fixed: a partner.

Being alone, I need to constantly work on myself and improve my discipline, learn new huge skills (e.g. managing a team). I also need to take care of the slippery biz dev parts such as legal and finance by myself. This is tough. I often feel exhausted. A partner would be a great addition.

Figure out what those guys offer, how are they branding themselves, reverse engineer their success. The other important thing is getting the branding down, so a solid domain name and a good copy would have easily set me apart from the rest. I’d look for freelancers with experience in the niche and leverage their results to secure the clients. Skip the step of needing proof of concept because the idea and results are already validated.  I’d just focus heavily on securing the first 10 clients while fully outsourcing the service delivery.

Marketplaces are not easy businesses to pull off and you need a lot of capital or other connections to make it happen. Frankly, there are far easier things to work on than a marketplace.But let’s assume we start over. I would not spend a dime on any development. Instead, I would reach into the areas of my expertise and just start sending traffic to a landing page focused on finding cheap vacation rentals. No listings, no website. Once the traffic came in, I’d squeeze it through a search form and show sample listings with the ability to type in a desirable discount %. Once the visitor goes through the form and gives us their information, I would then use THAT information to find desirable properties and reach out to them with a hot lead. The property manager or owner would need to come up with the specified discount to get the lead and I would then charge them for it. In a way, this is just a lead-generating business, but it creates a significant upside - reputation and income. I would then use this interaction to build out a website of trusted and “hand-picked” listings. The property owner would know that I am capable of generating leads so I could start asking them to pay me a monthly fee if necessary. This would generate recurring income all without spending a dime on development. (I had sufficient skills to make basic websites).Then, as I was able to generate more and more leads, I’d start adding these listings to a marketplace website, which would give me a sufficient run rate to keep going without burning out or going broke.I would never partner with a friend. There’s not much to say here other than it’s a huge mistake and rarely works. I would set deadlines for revenue figures and leads generated. If I missed those deadlines I would start looking at possible ways to pivot. If necessary, I would freelance part-time to make up any lost income. I’m not sure why I didn’t do this other than “I was stupid”.I would seek outside critique and advice periodically.

This convinced me that entrepreneurship is a challenge – it is not an easy path and overall, it’s tough. But it's 100% doable if you are persistent, passionate, and driven by the dream. The Lean Startup, Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility, and The Hard Thing About Hard Things, among other books, offered practical advice and tools. The Y Combinator Startup School also helped me tremendously and I strongly recommend it to all first-time founders. The biggest treasure is the team!

In my case, it cost me months of work that went to nothing and I had to stop the project. ‍  If you will be working on the content marketing and SEO, be prepared it will take months before you’ll start seeing the first effects and years before it will eventually pay off. But *it will* pay off only if you are consistent and focus on your readers/users.  More than always when producing new content, plan at least 50% of your time on promoting your content. I learned most of the ways how to do it by following Neil Patel’s Marketing School podcast. ‍",0,0
256," The first thing I would tell my former self is to relax. Entrepreneurship is much more of a journey than it is building your first business. I would spend  much time pressuring myself and worrying about making it work that I would cloud my vision when it came to making business decisions.  Instead of forcing that first businesses until the last minute, I wish we would have cut our losses sooner and moved on to the next thing.  I also spent a lot of time early worrying about what people in our startup community would think if I failed. I felt a lot of pressure from that, which was useless. And as it turns out, we did fail and then became a success that no one has heard about.  Cutting the cord on the B2C venture-backed play could have saved us a lot of time and money. We also always knew we didn’t really want to run an investor-backed company but we pressed forward because it was the only option we saw ahead of us at that time. ‍",1,0
257," It relates a lot to the biggest mistakes I mentioned previously. I’d say to myself - make sure you really talk to your customers, make sure you find ways to put your product out there and find out what people are ready to pay for as soon as possible. And finally - if you’re not really ready for this to be at least 3-5 years of ups and downs - don’t do it. ",0,0
258," Building Woovly has been exciting and enjoyable. I look back at my journey as an immense learning experience. Every obstacle, disadvantage, and challenge have taught me new lessons and I have treated them as learning opportunities. So, there is nothing I would want to do differently.  ‍",1,1
259," There is an endless number of little things I did wrong, but few big ones. More school would have been useful - couple more years of computer science, accounting, sales training.    Cashflow is everything. As long as you can keep paying the bills, you are in a position to grow. Be brutally honest about deals. Know the truth. You don’t have to tell other people, but you have to understand it for yourself. Understand the self-interest of everybody offering anything. That goes double for people on the investor side.  ",0,0
260," It has been a long journey & there have been learnings at each stage of our growth story. Here’s a few off the top of my head: Invest time in building relationships. Network & learn from other tech entrepreneurs. See what mistakes they are making, & try to prevent them.Focus on value. Keep track of the industry, but don’t focus too much on competitors. Instead, try to provide as much value to your customers.Never stop learning. Be a lifelong learner. Regardless of the role you are in, technology is evolving day in & day out & you don’t want to miss out on that.There will always be problems and fires to put out. You need to assess, pick your battles, and differentiate between good and bad problems. Identify where systems and processes can be tightened to mitigate the same.Hire people who believe in the vision. Being inspired and learning from each other is what it is all about. Moving ahead in challenging times requires excellent teamwork. ",1,0
261," There are a few things: I focused too much on the product and didn’t pay much attention to the market.My Marketing strategy should have come before product launch.Facebook was not the right platform to use as primary advertisingI had way too much money. Looking back, I wish I didn’t have as much money to spend because I would have been much more disciplined with my execution and not invest in useless things. I actually made a video discussing this here.Doing business with Nigerians can be a headache. And it’s not because of the people you’re doing business with, it’s the infrastructure there. Simple transactions to send and receive money can be a mile walk.I made some business decisions based on gut feeling rather than use facts and research. Those later came to bite me.Lastly, I would caution myself to take my time and not try and run someone else’s race. Looking back now maybe I was sucked into WURA because someone else seems to be doing well with the same concept. Perhaps it was their idea and product to launch, and not mine, to begin with. ‍",0,0
262, I think the most important lesson I have learned is persistence.  The ability to overcome self-doubt is a constant battle for all entrepreneurs. Doing so for an extended period results in thick skin and a willingness to tackle the million other obstacles that inevitably show up. ,1,0
263," If I had to do Yottio over again, I would probably choose to work on it part-time for a year or two, and not sell an enterprise product at all to start. Instead, I’d see if we could build a much properly SaaS-ified product so that we could avoid the hardware requirements for customers to trial. I would have loved to have moved the control interfaces out of their Java applications/GUI’s and into browser-based control. In 2019 this seems like a no-brainer in 2013 it was still pretty advanced to attempt to get multi-stream real-time video running reliably in-browser.  I wish that I had spent more time in due diligence overall though I’m not sure it would have changed my own choices. My co-founder had a core tech that was really neat and it was in my wheelhouse to make it work in a modern world. ‍",0,0
264," Define target personas very clearlyLayout the vision and break it down into sizeable chunksOnly hire when target persona and vision are already setI’d try a more scalable approach from the beginning While conducting research, I would cluster the needs and problems to different target personas and would niche down my further interviews to one specific persona. My MVP would only serve this one customer persona instead of many. If I don’t find a product for this target group, I would try another. These are the concepts of product-market fit but I lost the focus. With that MVP, I would work on a bigger vision and break it down into sizable chunks to understand what needs to be done, and what skills are needed to achieve this. I would only hire somebody when the target persona and vision are already set, and the person aligns a hundred percent with the vision. And I would fire faster. From day one, my focus would be to find a more scalable version of the product than at the beginning of YEP. I knew about the shortcomings of the program approach but I thought we could outsmart the system - mission failed. I did not spend enough time building and leveraging the community we had. We had highly engaged members who would have been more than happy to help, but I thought I needed to be responsible for everything.  ",0,0
265," If I tried to start over I would do almost the exact opposite of what we did. I’m a strong believer that the best way to build a consumer product is to create something fun and iterate according to user feedback. Starting from the beginning, I’d start with a paper + pen prototype, then finalize UI in Figma, then create a prototype that I can send out (also in Figma), then create the core MVP and build a beta list of <1000 users. Once you have beta users, pay close attention to their feedback, explore user flows and understand what’s working and what’s not. Make sure you’re not throwing extra money around, spend as little as possible to validate your product.  I still think the Zapstream concept is superior to the other live video products out there. That designer we hired and I are still good friends, just the other day we were joking about how incredible Zapstream could’ve been during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our vision was to take live interaction to the next level, including multiplayer games and fun reasons to go live. There’s definitely still space for that.  ‍",0,0
266," The number one lesson is to don't give up. When I look at ZenMaid versus some of our competitors that didn't make it, it's just that we kept breaking through barriers and obstacles and wouldn't let anything get in our way. Most of our competitors who closed didn't fail they decided to stop trying at some point. The other thing I would say is playing to your strengths. Focus more on your strengths rather than addressing your weaknesses. My ability to sell one-on-one is not the best, so we doubled down on marketing. Eventually, you can get to the point where you can hire a team to do whatever is fast, and you can just pay people who are good at specific strategies that you want to put in place. But until you get to that point, focusing on what you already do best will move the needle the fastest. Also, document everything or think about everything in terms of processes and systems. I recommend Principles by Ray Dalio, which explains why you want to have everything well-defined within your company.  There’s a good chance that 20% of your day is creating 80% of the results within a business. In some companies, you will have 20% of your customers, making you 80% of the money. Thinking about this can help you figure out how to focus and prioritize. It’s beneficial to revisit and reimplement all these lessons I do it once a year or every 2 years. Every time I do it, my productivity goes up, and I get a little bit happier because I got more time to spend on the things that I love.",1,0
267," Having a specific niche is essential to have tremendous success. Do not hesitate to raise your price when it makes sense. Clients are easier to work with, have more established businesses, and know exactly what they want. Margins are now a lot higher (70-80%), which allows us to reinvest in the team (we can now afford more experienced staff) + reinvest in growth. ",1,1
268, You don’t need to invest something completely new or revolutionary to be a successful entrepreneur. Some of the longest-standing businesses solve a critical problem for their customers with a simple product or service. That’s why Zogics has been able to continue to grow over years: we’ve been laser-focused on serving our customers and meeting their needs. Is something that has been a common theme throughout my career. ,1,0
