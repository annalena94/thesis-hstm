0," Hi, I’m Matt “GundayMonday” Sever. I’m a data science professional in their early 30s out of Detroit, MI. First entered the data science field from a grad school DARPA grant to successfully predict when soldiers were going to get sick with the flu before they started sneezing. Fell into the fintech space working for Quicken Loans on everything from speech analytics to nationwide automated marketing engines. And have dabbled in video game-related startups for the past decade. Most famous is Instaburst (200+ virtual team that made League of Fighters), but we’ll be talking about my first startup 101 Studios today! 101 Studios was an edutainment producer. That’s a cringe-worthy word for “video games that teach you things while you play them”. Our flagship (and only game) was called Antibody. You played as a soldier for hire who would shrink down to microscopic size and fight germs inside of sick patients. We made a pokemon clone to do this where the random monsters you’d fight were actual bacteria, viruses, and fungi. You’d use real treatments to take them down. Each random encounter was a flashcard, each type of attack a different answer you could potentially give on a med school exam. Thought was to gamify what med students usually brute force memorized to make it easier to remember! The business model was to develop the game(s) and then sell access to play with a monthly subscription fee. ",0,0
1," Hi! I am currently working at Elastic making sure our APM solution is as good as possible for people with Ruby apps. Elastic is a great company and a lovely place to work (and we’re hiring!). On the side, I’ve built and run a few side projects. Creating things is a very meditative thing for my brain, so I have to make a conscious effort to keep the number of projects down. The most successful of the side projects have been 10er.co, a Patreon-ish service for (mostly) Danish creators. 10er is the perfect side project: It solved one of my own problems, it’s making a nice bit of recurring revenue and it takes very little work to maintain. Like many others in our industry, I’m self-taught. I started a university education some 10 years ago but dropped out to try my luck at stand-up comedy. Did that full-time for a few years with the occasional programming contract on the side. Then, at some point it became tiresome to keep fighting to get by from comedy when I loved programming just as much and programming is way easier to make a living from. ‍",1,0
2," My name is Cheryl Malik, and I’m a law school dropout, cupcake bakery deserter, burlesque troupe leaver-behind, and general quitter. My true background is in publishing: I worked as the editor-in-chief at the literary magazines at my high school and in college, and that was what I always, always wanted to do. You know, when I “grew up.” But I was told that industry was going away (And it kind of did), so I went to law school instead. Obviously. I knew almost instantly law school wasn’t for me, so, armed with a useful philosophy degree, I worked through strange potential career path after strange potential career path, working as an employee in music and audio sales, then starting a burlesque troupe, cupcake catering business, vintage clothing sales, vintage clothing TV producer, then settled in as a digital marketing and web design freelancer. The one constant the entire time was the food blog I’d started right before law school: 40 Aprons. I’d started the blog as a creative outlet as I entered a notoriously dry, uncreative, and challenging process, and it grew slowly along with my writing, marketing, and photography skills. In the last year, I discovered my true niche and voice, and in 12 months, my blog income grew nearly 4000%. My traffic increased 1300%, skyrocketing from 71,279 page views in January 2017 (The tipping point at which my blog’s traffic was already increasing, having found my niche and started giving it my all) to 1,059,834 page views in January 2018. That means my blog has grown my income double or triple what I was making at my last agency job, depending on the month. We’re working on a food blogging & photography coaching program to help other food bloggers find success. In addition to that, my long-time dream of starting a design and marketing agency focused on food bloggers, restaurants, and food brands has finally come to fruition: my agency Layer Cake is active and taking clients! Our passion is creating digital experiences that are worthy of the food they feature, and we’re anything but a churn-and-burn conveyor belt-style agency. We become a part of each client and take on the business as our own this, in conjunction with my experience in the food and food blogging world, is what makes us special. I’m also a mother to a toddler with one on the way, so there’s a lot of teetering and waddling going on in our studio right now. ‍",1,1

5," I am a 32-years-old software engineer I’ve been working in software development for the past 12 years. My first job was in my own startup, which I started along with some college friends in a college incubator. I quit that once I got a permanent job and my parents didn’t allow me to work at a startup any further. I then served the Govt, started and failed multiple startups, and then joined my friends in their businesses. Nowadays, I’m working in an MNC Software company on AI and blockchain technology. Today we are discussing my first startup, Adleaf Technologies, which I started in 2013. Adleaf was a blend of programming bootcamps and software solutions. We admitted a few fresh engineers and trained them on web and mobile app development. We then gave them our client’s work to complete, being able to deliver dev work at a low cost. We then hired a few engineers from our bootcamp to work full-time with our upcoming batches and the rest were hired by our partner companies and job consultants.  Adleaft had three revenue streams: Money from bootcamps.Money from customers to whom we were delivering mobile apps and websites.Money from companies our trained engineers were joining. It was a perfect business model for a bootstrapped company like ours. ‍",0,0
6,"  My name is Matthew Anderson and I’m 31 years old. Originally from Indiana (USA), I have been based in Mexico City for the last 3 years. My time is currently split between professional projects and art projects.  Professionally - I’m working with a partner to create a Shopify App meant to be the engine that powers “Subscription-First” e-commerce businesses. I am also working pretty closely with a few DTC Subscription businesses (who are using our app) as a startup strategy and growth consultant.  Personally - I love making music and painting. My first full-length album is set to release this August, I just wrapped up creating what will be my second album, and I paint regularly with my work scheduled to appear in various upcoming art shows.  Adproval was a marketplace to connect blogging and social media influencers with brands (though the “Influencer” title didn’t really exist when we started). We really wanted to provide enough choice for influencers on our platform to only collaborate with brands that they felt aligned with their values and the values of their audiences.   As it was 2011 when we first started, our primary focus was bloggers with their own sites. We started with a widget for them to easily customize embedded Display Ad slots that they could price as they wanted and receive offers from brands to purchase directly, from which we took a commission. We then expanded to broader social media promotion (i.e., “In addition to a display ad on my blog, I will tweet about your product X times throughout the month”).  I was a non-technical sole founder and CEO, so I pretty much carried all the non-technical job duties (which were handled by various contractors and ultimately a design and development agency partner). Fundraising, marketing, customer support, etc… you know how it goes :). ‍",0,0
7," We are Jared Brier and Eric Schneider, and we’re the co-founders and co-CEOs of AKKO, the Spotify for protection plans. Just as Spotify bundled together all the songs people wanted to hear in one convenient package, we’re bundling together protection for all your most valuable personal possessions – starting with your phone, but including up to 25 other items, including laptops, TVs, audio equipment, sports gear, and much more.  Before AKKO, as folks currently know it, we were making a physical product in the vein of a smart lock. In researching warranties for that product, we realized there had to be something better out there – and since there wasn’t, we decided to make it. Once we came up with this idea, we knew we had to pivot and throw ourselves into this fully, which is exactly what we’ve done. We’ve scaled up from humble beginnings and now have thousands of customers nationwide, plus some major partnerships and new seed capital enabling us to continue growing steadily and developing the AKKO platform to be even better at suiting the needs of our partners and customers. ‍",1,0
8," I was one of the co-founders of Ansaro. Our mission at Ansaro was to use data science to improve hiring. Specifically, we focused on better interviewing.  At Ansaro, I was responsible for product design and sales and marketing. In our early days, I did a bit of data science too. We started Ansaro in late 2016 and shut down 2 years later, at the end of 2018. After 2 pivots (while staying within the scope of data science to improve hiring), we had failed to achieve product-market fit, and we shut down the business and returned our remaining capital to investors.  We were based in San Francisco, grew to a team of 6, and raised $3M in VC funding. We had a number of large enterprise customers, but never got beyond pilot contracts. We were aiming for a SaaS model, but our actual revenue was nearly entirely from services-based pilots.  Before Ansaro, I worked in consulting (Bain), tech investing (TPG), and software development (SolveBio, then a Series A startup). I studied math as an undergrad at Stanford and did an MBA at Harvard at both universities, I was interested in applying statistics/math/data science to messy human problems (like hiring!) Today, I’m a product manager at Opendoor, where I work on machine-learning products for the real estate industry.  ‍",0,0

11," I grew up in Florida without much exposure to entrepreneurship or business until I met my step-father who owned a wedding company. I also saw the value of owning a company but never cared to learn about the mechanics until I became obsessed with reading business books and understanding the systems that made them possible. It also helps push you forward when you realize you’ve accomplished nothing for 5+ years “playing” business, rather than doing it.  Fast forward a few more years and I’m finishing my degree in Finance full-time and running a SaaS tool that helps Amazon sellers reprice their inventory to increase sales using AI. I can finally say that I’ve found a business that I’m passionate about driving forward.  My background is being an Amazon seller myself and growing a rather large wholesale operation where I purchased goods directly from brands and sold on Amazon. Having this deep knowledge helped my co-founder and me to build an amazing product that we would want for ourselves. Even if we failed, we would still use the product.  ",1,0

14," Hi! I am 29, based in Berlin, and I have been building web projects and companies since I was 13 years old. Back then, I started selling graphics, websites, and scripts online and always thought: “Wow, that's amazing. I can get money for something I would do for free.” After some entrepreneurial experiments, back in university, I created my first big company, called StudyHelp, with the idea of bridging the gap between offline and online tutoring. The company scaled quite quickly to over 200 cities and a million website visits per month we also raised several rounds of funding. But, feeling stuck on the things I was working on, at some point, I decided to leave the company on an operational level. And I found something that I couldn’t stop thinking about - the relationship between founders and investors and how everything about fundraising works. Since then, I have been spending my time on two fronts. On the one hand, I decided to become an investor myself and since then have been investing in companies all over the world, from India to Brazil. On the other hand, I have been growing my company BaseTemplates and some other projects. BaseTemplates is your go-to place for fundraising material. We are selling different templates, such as pitch decks or financial model templates, and offering custom pitch deck designs. In addition to that, we are also sharing knowledge, lessons & best practices around fundraising and entrepreneurship. ‍",1,0
15," I’ve got a fairly diverse background before starting my current business, Beardbrand. My career started off in sales and I worked for a few companies doing inside and outside sales. The one that helped me the most with my career was my job as an outside salesman for a small commercial printing company. This is where I was able to hone my knowledge and experience in the creative field. During the economic crash of 2008, I lost my job and started my journey as an entrepreneur. My first business was less of a business and more of self-employment. I joined my dad’s company and tried my hand at being an executive recruiter. Placing jobs during a recession wasn’t an easy thing to accomplish, and I hung up my cleats with no success. As I faced challenges as a recruiter I started another business on the side called Wakomo. Wakomo was my first attempt into the e-commerce space and I designed and produced vinyl wall graphics (my inspiration was Blik). I built the website, produced the graphics, and had one or two sales, but I lost confidence in myself and eventually gave that up. After a string of failures, I decided it was time to start making money again and worked as a financial advisor for about 18 months. I had success here, but I found the job unfulfilling. I had the taste of freedom and working for the ‘man’ wasn’t for me. So I quit that job to start up another business, Sovrnty. Sovrnty was to be a marketing consulting business but ended up essentially being a freelance graphic design company. I gained a few clients who helped sustain me, but I never felt like it was a proper business - I was essentially self-employed and I didn’t want to be a professional graphic designer. During this time (2010 - 2011) I started growing my beard out while still being integrated into the business community. I would get lots of comments about my beard looking like Grizzly Adams, ZZ Top, or Duck Dynasty. While these guys are cool in their own way, I didn’t feel connected to those stereotypes.  I attended a beard-related event and realized there were a lot of other guys like me, guys who I called Urban Beardsmen. I wanted to unite these groups of guys and show the world that you can be stylish, professional, be a normal dude, and have a beard. At the time that was a very foreign concept, so I established Beardbrand as a way to unite Urban Beardsmen and give them the tools they needed to feel confident about their beards. Beardbrand started off through content - we had a YouTube channel, Tumblr page, and a blog. We built a small community and then leveraged some lucky press with the NY Times to launch an e-commerce business selling grooming products. The rest, as they say, is history. Currently, Beardbrand is a 7 figure business with just under 20 employees in Austin, TX. We formulate and manufacture men’s grooming products that focus on beard care, hair care, and body care. We ship out of both USA & UK to serve our customers across the world. ‍",1,0
16," I’m an IT professional. I guess the closest description I could give you would be “systems administrator”, though I’ve never had that as a formal job title. Let me just clear something up: I don’t like the term “startup” because to me it conjures ideas of a trendy firm in a fashionable city like London or San Francisco burning through cash like it’s going out of fashion, with wild projections of how much money they’re going to make Real Soon Now ™. But 99% of new businesses aren’t that. They’re started up by one or two people who are more interested in paying the mortgage than they are in being the next Google. And so, it was for me - sure, I entertained visions of making an income far greater than I could as an employee, but that was as high as I dreamed. The business model was simple: take what I already did for a living and turn it into a freelance “IT-manager-for-hire” type model. That’s one thing I was always very clear on: I wasn’t interested in doing PC troubleshooting for individuals. ‍",0,0
17," Hey! My name is Mary Haskett. My first startup experience was a skydiving school that I ended up running when I was in college. I competed in skydiving at the collegiate level and had a lot of fun, but I learned that there is no money to be made in skydiving. But that experience was enough to convince me that I could start a company so after I got my master’s degree I founded a training development company that I grew to profitability over ten years without outside funding and then sold to a defense contractor. After the acquisition, I joined the company as a Vice President and learned a lot about biometrics and working with the Department of Defense (DoD). I deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan on a number of occasions and had some amazing experiences.  I realized that I like small companies, so I left to start another company that primarily builds software for the DoD and foreign governments. My current company stems from that experience we took what we learned working with biometric identification software and moved from software to building hardware. We built a portal for high speed face and iris identification – basically, we can identify people in real time as they walk by at a full walking speed. I’ve just formed a company for this product and it’s called Blink Identity. ‍",0,1

Then we handle everything from office design to delivery and installation. As you grow, move or needs change, we help you update your space plan or trade your furniture in for credit toward your next purchase.  For those who haven’t furnished an office before, reviewing the status quo might help illuminate why we’re different: growing companies typically face two bad options when it comes time to buy office furniture.  On the one hand, you can go with “fast furniture” from Ikea or Office Depot, solutions that are cheap and fast but lack quality and service that scales to the needs of an enterprise (try asking Ikea to negotiate with your landlord about freight elevator access or union labor). On the other hand are “contract furniture” solutions like Herman Miller, which make wonderful physical products but sell through middlemen dealers that require you to navigate an opaque sales process, wait 6-12 weeks for delivery, and pay markups of up to 50%. With either solution, when you outgrow your space, you’re stuck with the furniture: most people just throw it out, which means 17 billion pounds of office furniture in the trash each year.  With Branch, outfitting your team with a standing desk, ergonomic chair, and filing cabinet costs as much as a single chair might cost from a high-end furniture dealer, with transparency, flexibility and full service included.

26," I am a computer scientist who stumbled into starting a startup (called The Astonishing Tribe) back in 2002. We were six friends who built an art project then we were contracted by Sony to help them improve the performance of their mobile phone user interfaces. We didn’t want to be selling hours, so we claimed to have a product - and off we were. In 2010 we had grown to 180 people, and that year we were shipping in over 12% of the world’s phones from vendors like Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, and Sony. And we had designed the first version of Android’s user interface. Suddenly, we got an offer from Blackberry, who was the biggest smartphone vendor at the time, to acquire us for $150m. We joined, and as we didn’t have any venture capital investors, it was a crazy deal for us. After that, I worked two years running M&A for EMEA for Blackberry at the same time as I started angel investing. Both roles taught me a lot, and I realized that I needed to get back into the trenches and started another company. This time I did an AI company (Brisk) doing prescriptions/action recommendations. We raised $2m from VC and angels, and after four years and some amazing customers, we decided that we were not going to get the flywheel going. We did a soft landing and sold off the assets to a price almost lower than the legal fees. After that, I started an angel group, NordicMakers, and spend most of my time being an angel and helping startups. I founded a local startup community and a startup house but hired people to run operations for both.  I also blog a lot here. ‍",0,0
27," Hey everyone! I’m Joel Griffith, a Portland, Oregon based Software Engineer (now turned entrepreneur) that’s been working a ton on this thing called browserless. browserless is, at its essence, what I call “chrome-as-a-service.” What that means is that when a developer needs to have programmatic control over a web-browser as part of their service they can use us to provide it. We take care of installing the browser, running it in a streamlined fashion, and other small details like making sure fonts are installed properly. Right now, the #1 reason users use it for is generating nice PDF files from their website, which can be a pretty hard thing to do. This service is incredibly useful for a number of things, such as capturing screenshots, PDF generation, and data-gathering. Unsurprisingly there’s a lot of players out there already, however, practically none of them offer on-demand programmatic access 24/7. It currently generates revenue in two ways: an old-school license model and a monthly subscription for “hosted” access. Currently, I’m working on a new usage-based account type that does per-second billing. This has been an incredibly interesting feature, and often requested, since it’s really cheap to get started ($0.00008/second!). ‍",1,0
28," Hi there! My name is Jordi Giménez. Once upon a time, I studied computer science in Barcelona which led to jobs in web back-end, web front-end, IT security, and more. More recently, my path has led me to iOS and Android development. I love Barcelona, and I’ve been lucky enough to co-found two companies there, Mobile Jazz and Bugfender. Besides Mobile Jazz and Bugfender, we also run experiments such as Localname, a service to give your local development machine a URL accessible from the Internet and DevCraft, a newsletter for the curious developer. We are testing both and they might or might not become “something” eventually. Bugfender is a tool to help developers debug their mobile applications by collecting the logs of their user’s mobile devices from anywhere in the globe. We get the logs and put them together in a clean interface, where you can filter and view data by user, time frame, mobile device make and model and similar things. Some readers might be familiar with crash reporting tools Bugfender goes one step further by allowing remote access to the logging facilities of users’ devices.  We started the company with only 3 employees, but today we are a team of 9. Bugfender today is installed on more than 9000 apps and running on over 46 million devices. We went from zero to $11,000 monthly recurring revenue (MRR) in 4 years, without any external investment. I do a little bit of everything at the company: from project management, to back-end and iOS development, sales, customer support, setting up online advertisement campaigns, to writing content for our blog. Every day is a little different. As you can see, everything we do is bootstrapped. As founders, we are the only investors our investment is our time, not a ton of cash. This impacts how we run the company: After four years our team is only 9 people, some of them part-time, and we are very careful with our budgets. For example, when setting up an advertisement campaign, our goal is to make a useful product people are willing to pay for. Our ads are sometimes a little confounding to potential customers because nowadays so many things are “free” in the sense they cost no money. But even with these “free” SaaS products, consumers need to know that are still paying in some hidden way, like being targeted with advertisement and having your data sold to the highest bidder. In contrast, we are looking for straightforward customers who value what we offer and are willing to pay for it. Fortunately, there are enough of these people that we are about to reach break-even. We could have already reached break-even if we stopped investing in the company, but we are choosing to keep investing above our revenue, even if this slightly affects our financials for now. We are very open with our numbers, you can check them real-time here. Another fun fact is that the company is totally remote. I am based in Barcelona, but our team is distributed all around Europe. We work remotely and plan retreats or “workations” every now and then. Early on we recognized that meeting together face to face is essential to productivity and team building. Plus, it’s just really fun. ‍",1,0

No headaches, just cloud. We launched Bunnyshell in March 2018, got a €750K investment in under 18 months, and today we provide services to corporate clients all over the world. ",1,0
30," I'm a Front-end Web Developer and have been in the industry for over 10 years now.  I've traditionally made a living working a regular full-time salary job, however over the past year I've been transitioning to contract work while I build a side business. Currently, I'm finishing up an online video course on WebdriverIO, which is a framework for web automation tests. The course is almost 50 videos long and has taken me over a year to put together. It's been my most successful project to date, but not my first. I've worked on many different projects over the years, with many attempts to have some success with them. One of them is a mobile app that didn't quite take off like I would have hoped. ‍",0,0
31," Hey everyone! I’m Danh, founder of Buttercloth. I’m 45, was born in Vietnam and I’m currently living in Carson, California. Our headquarters were originally based in Long Beach, California, but we grew so fast that we had to move to Carson. I grew up working in my family’s small tailor shop. When I was ten, I started making my own clothes and dreaming of coming to America to become a fashion designer. When my family immigrated here in 1994, I took fashion classes at a local college and landed a job at Mattel - designing clothes for Barbie. When I saved enough money, I enrolled in my dream school, Otis, and after graduating was recruited by 7 for All Mankind. I later was Head Designer at House of Howe (Union Bay), and then Affliction Clothing for 10 years. When I came up with the idea to create my own brand of luxury dress shirts, I quit my job and cashed in my 401K to start the company. Today, I am living the dream with Buttercloth, a clothing brand selling comfortable shirts. We’re currently selling everything throughout our eCommerce. We’re mainly focused on the US audience, though we plan to expand globally in the upcoming years. ",1,0

33," My co-founder: “Let’s make a website to help people get outside. A website where people who own land can list their land and campers can book it. It will make us millions of dollars!” Me: “Oh yeah! Good idea!” A few months later…. My co-founder: “We made $36.87 this month.” Me: “We are on our way to making millions!” ‍ Be realistic, optimistic, and know that the law of attraction actually exists! What I know for sure is that it’s never too late to start a business, and I’m not just saying that because I’m 39 and optimistic. Based out of Vancouver BC, I have a love for the mountains and water. It’s always a privilege to breath fresh air and drink clean water.  My education is admittedly a little nerdy, as I have a degree in chemical and environmental engineering with a master in occupational hygiene. So, it’s my determination to succeed and I work hard, but, most importantly, it’s my love for nature and helping people that led me to create Campertunity.  What’s Campertunity? It’s an online peer-to-peer marketplace where users can book a campsite on private land. Basically, I introduced camping to the shared economy in Canada. Now, I’m happy to be the co-founder and to welcome landowners nationwide and campers worldwide to list their land or book a campsite on Campertunity.  As a co-founder, my role is big and all-encompassing. I handle everything from marketing to website maintenance to making sure our receipts are in order for tax time. It’s a big job to start a business and an even bigger one to maintain it. But, I love the freedom and excitement associated with creating my own project.  Who is our target audience? Campers and landowners. Landowners are anyone with outdoor space that’s big enough to pitch a tent, and campers are anyone who likes sleeping under the stars for either one night or 365 nights a year (that includes glampers). So, please sign up with Campertunity for easy campsite bookings on amazing private properties nationwide.  And, amazing properties is an understatement. We have campsite hosts who offer yoga classes, fresh Canadian bacon for breakfast, horseback riding and tours of their farm. Have you ever seen a fainting goat or a sheep being sheared? Now’s your chance. Wheelchair accessible farms are also available because getting people outside means everyone. ‍ As we just reach our one year anniversary since Campertunity’s launch, I’m proud to say that we are growing every day, and am confident that Campertunity will be a name that’s synonymous with camping.

34," Hi! My name is Nick and I’m a 24 year old entrepreneur from Boston. My two passions are helping people and building cool things, and that’s exactly what I get to do with my startup Canary where we’re changing the way venues book live music. I recently quit my $130,000 job to pursue Canary full time. Canary is a mobile app where venues and musicians are booking their gigs. Everything we are doing is because we believe in connecting the music scene. We believe that venues and musicians should focus on what matters to them, and that booking live music should be easy. The way we enable our users to do that is by creating a beautifully designed app that’s simple to use. As a venue, you can find new talent to hire and handle all communication and scheduling with minimal effort. As a musician, you can browse gig opportunities and create a profile to show off your brand to the venues who browse the app. As a co-founder and CEO, it’s my job to strategize how we’re going to grow and be successful. I’m also a software engineer, so I’m always updating the app with new features for our users. My co-founder is Josh McAloon and he leads our venue acquisition. We also signed on Tom Hamilton from Aerosmith as an advisor. That’s a huge win for us since he brings a ton of experience and industry knowledge. ‍",1,0
35," Hi, Biron here. I’m a 34-year-old entrepreneur from Boston, USA. I’ve been traveling for the past few years while growing my online business at the same time. My business is a job search advice website called Career Sidekick. We earn revenue from a mix of products (a course and e-books), affiliate marketing, and display advertising. As founder and owner, I’m responsible for strategic decision-making and the overall profit/loss of the business. I’m also our PR person, for now, so I am responsible for getting press coverage, getting more exposure, etc. Finally, I’m involved in the content planning and creation process for our web content, even as we’ve grown to a multiple-six-figure business. While this wouldn’t be optimal for a founder/CEO in many businesses, we’re primarily a content website, so our web content is vital to our success. And since we publish a relatively low volume of content (one to four articles per month), with a focus on high-quality, evergreen content that will be relevant for years to come, I feel justified in spending some of my time ensuring our content remains excellent. ‍",1,0
36," Hi! My name is Steve and I’m a 28-year-old entrepreneur from Toronto, Canada. Though at the moment I’m “digital nomad”-ing in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Before I jumped headfirst into the world of entrepreneurship at 24, I was a management consultant at Oliver Wyman. I co-founded Chowdy with a childhood friend and ex-housemate in order to solve the problem we both personally had, which was that we were spending way too much money eating out. To solve that, Chowdy offered subscription-based prepared meals plans to Toronto’s young professionals at a flat $7.99 per meal, with plans ranging from 6 meals per week to 14 meals per week.  In terms of how we divided up responsibilities, I was in charge of operations, technology, and finance while my partner was responsible for customer service, marketing, and outreach. In reality, we both did whatever was needed.  We had some success with this setup for a while. We grew Chowdy to $1.3M in annual revenue in 2 years, a team of 8 staff, and successfully pitched on CBC’s Dragon’s Den (though we turned down the funding offer). A big reason for the success was an innovation we created that no other prepared meal companies were doing: we didn’t deliver. Rather, we had our customers pick up their meals from one of our partner cafes in downtown Toronto. These “hubs”, as we called it, were independent local cafes at prime downtown locations the cafes would provide both the space for the fridge and the staff to track customer pickups. In return, we paid them a relatively small fee of $500-$800 per month, plus all the foot traffic from our customer base. The reason this model worked so well was that it solved one of the biggest problems meal delivery companies face: the extremely high cost of last-mile delivery. It allowed us to cut distribution cost per meal to less than $1, compared to $5-$8 for a typical meal delivery company (which, by the way, is why none of them are profitable). The hub system allowed us to scale up very quickly. Looking back at the 2.5 years we ran Chowdy, its eventual failure was the confluence of many factors from unsustainable business model to cobbled-together operations, but the straw the broke camel’s back was regulatory (and ironically, related to our hub system). This experience was ultimately very educational for me from both the successes we had and the causes of its end, and I’m applying a lot of what I learned to the project I’m currently working on - The Travel Brief - which is a crowdsourced travel guide to off-the-beaten-path destinations around the world. While these two businesses are so different, I think a lot of tactics are the same, like how to acquire customers, how to improve visibility, how to find a sustainable model, and how to deal with the emotional rollercoaster as a founder. While we’re still on the very early stages of The Travel Brief, having just launched it 3 months ago, we’re already seeing some promising growth and at the moment we have ~200 users (~100 monthly active), 2000 monthly views, and 20-30 new pieces of content generated by our users every week, and most metrics are trending positively.  ‍",0,0

The ‘built’ is in quotes because as a developer, this is the only non-saas business I’ve ever launched. Cold Email Studio (CES) does cold email as a service. We’re an outsourced BDR team for startups. We do everything from hunting leads, to writing copy, to the actual email sending (shoutout to Guillaume Moubeche for creating Lemlist! We’re happy customers.) as well as following up with prospects, handling objections with the ultimate objective of putting meetings on founders’ calendars. We charge a monthly fee starting at $2k per month (currently) though we’ve been steadily increasing prices up to market. Today, I’m focused on building XOXO Capital, it’s a micro private equity firm that buys small, profitable SaaS businesses. We’ve done our first 3 acquisitions and I’m working on raising a fund. I’m sure it sounds odd that a service business from an AI engineer is sitting under a micro private equity company. I hope it will make sense to you by the end of this article and to me in 5 ish years. ‍",1,0

41," Iowa guy. Joined the military in 1997 and left in 2006 with a few deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. During my time overseas, I saw that armed conflict could do little to raise a nation from poverty. Coupled with my understanding of U.S. Foreign Policy at the time, I didn’t see the war slowing down. (That was in 2005) Fast forward to 2008. I was hired by a Seattle company, Remote Medical International, for military and government sales. We focused on providing medical providers and clinics in “austere” environments. My job was to assist the government and service providers with help in “difficult” regions. On my trips to these regions, I witnessed the non-military side of war zones. In those war zones, it was entrepreneurs that were the real change makers. They set up businesses, employed citizens, and maintained their own security. Everywhere I went, I saw the same thing. On a trip to Kabul, I was invited to visit an Afghan combat boot and uniform factory. In this factory, I witnessed hundreds of people working--this was the first positive outcome I saw from the war effort. When I found out the factory was going to shut down after the war, my elation turned to fury. Then it happened. I looked on a table, saw a combat boot with a flip flop thong punched in it, and thought it was cool. The factory manager agreed to let me run with it and I immediately returned to my hotel room to register Combat Flip Flops domain. Combat Flip Flops is a mission-based company that empowers American consumers to manufacture peace in war zones with economy. We work with local entrepreneurs to make fashion and lifestyle products. Each product sold funds a day of education for an Afghan girl. It’s been an amazing adventure and thankful for all of the friends, family, and coworkers that got the company to where it is today. ‍",1,0
42," Hey! My name is Kaito, and I’m a 20-year-old university student, entrepreneur, and currently an assurance intern at Ernst and Young based in Vancouver, Canada. I’m in my third year getting my BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) and concentrating in Entrepreneurship and Innovation at Simon Fraser University. Throughout my university years, I've realized the potential that youth have when it comes down to pursuing diversified experiences, failing (and learning) quickly, and being “risky” at such an opportune time of life. I started my first company when I was 19 and it was called Community Coders, a platform that provided high school students meaningful work experience to develop local businesses’ online presence. Think of it as the “GenM” for highschool students in grades 11 and 12 here in Canada. I was the co-founder, and worked on the operations, marketing, and sales responsibilities for about two years, working both part and full time throughout. Our business model was made through selling digital marketing & web development packages to small businesses and paying the high school students at contractors alongside keeping an intermediary/management fee. For example, we charged a business $1k for a website, paid the student $750 and kept $250 for management. Most of my insights will be coming from my perspective with my first business as a university student and youth founder. Now that this chapter of my life is over, I decided to start working on a side project called Spred while I’m on my internship full time during the busy season of accounting. Spred is a workflow management tool that allows clothing resellers to upload, manage, analyze, and sell their clothes to all online marketplaces (like eBay and Etsy), and I’m super excited to have competed in a couple of entrepreneurship competitions for this project.  I also wanted to give a quick shout to the Failory team for featuring me - when I’m answering these questions, I realized that it was an amazing way for myself to reflect and also provide an outlet for some of the mistakes I’ve made.    ",0,0
43," Hey! Before all this online business stuff, I used to program controllers that made real-world equipment come to life. Things like motors, pump, even entire mine sites. Like most of us in online business, my business partner and I just got fed up working for other people. We started a long, painful foray into software and web design. Over nearly 8 years we’ve built 3 (and a half) software products for our own business, sold one of them, built countless websites and undertaken some huge software projects for a range of clients. One of the biggest issues we had was getting information and content from clients. To be blunt, it was a total pain in the ass. It held up payments, stalled entire projects and added all this extra stress we just didn’t need. So that’s the challenge we’ve taken on with Content Snare - a tool to help agencies get content from their clients on time and in the right format. My roles in this business are community management and marketing. So… you know… doing interviews like this :) I’m lucky to have a business partner who’s a total tech-head and pretty much the best developer I’ve ever met. He handles the tech team so I can work on getting more people using Snare. Right now, Content Snare has a pretty simple model. It’s a monthly subscription based on how many team members are using the tool. In the future, we may toy with adding some services or add-ons. ‍",1,0

For part of the program, I was an exchange student at INCAE in Costa Rica where I took a class in entrepreneurship and venture capital. During the course of that class, I got really excited about the possibility of leveraging my software skills into a startup, and the plans for Cuddli began to take shape.

I started this company just over three years ago after spending the last seven years in various sales and marketing jobs. For the most part, I had worked with early-stage startups in the tech industry. I had met so many people in that world I believed weren’t up to snuff on motivation, education, and/or skills. Not to say I’m any kind of a genius. In fact, I’m far from that (re: 2.7GPA in high school and an art degree). I do understand how to work hard and learn from other people’s mistakes. I also know how to read. I was dirt poor so didn’t have much to lose when it came to financial repercussions if I failed (it also meant I had nothing to invest - low expectations). Basically, I had the itch to start something of my own and see what could happen. I’ll be the first one to tell you chocolate dicks were not on the radar back then. Dick At Your Door started when a buddy found a silicone penis mold at a random sex shop on a cross-country drive (thank you Lincoln, Nebraska). My buddy and I thought it would be hilarious to send chocolate dicks in the mail to our friends. Disclaimer: It was hilarious. We eventually threw up a website to continue the prank and people started reaching out that weren’t our friends. That was the lightbulb moment for us. From there it was perfecting the molding process, finding a real chocolatier (and eventually becoming chocolatiers ourselves), building a secure website that was legit and going forth into the world of dicks and chocolate making. ‍",1,0

For instance, throughout my time in London, I slept on friends' couches for a few months, lived in a house under renovation for free in exchange for (very bad) carpentry work, and rented a pantry as a bedroom. During the last one, the house was located on a street in Tottenham that was quarantined twice due to gunshot noises. That said, the room was only £380 with utilities included, so I'd say it was a fair deal for London standards! While being part of the indie making community, it dawned on me how lucrative my skills were in writing and community engagement. I expanded my network in the scene by taking part in fun online blogging initiatives, such as being an editor at Maker Mag and actively engaging in relevant communities. The indie making community has changed my life on a financial level. Three months after being part of it, I was earning 2.5x more than my full-time salary in a French email tech company by working with founders and bootstrappers. It helped me develop a healthier relationship with money, understand the value of my work, and see how launching and growing companies can be darn fun. The community has helped me understand that I can build an ethical business and provide a reasonable stream of income for content writers and other creatives.  So that brings me to Embarque. I owe much of my creative growth to extremely talented — yet overlooked — underground writers, artists, performers, poets, and journalists who are either brown, queer, women or a mixture of these identities. At Embarque, we want to link talented English-speaking content writers to founders and companies that need their services. As a nod to my creative roots, we aim to make our hiring practices as inclusive as possible. As the saying goes, 'talent is everywhere, opportunity is not.' On the client-facing side, we want to help bootstrappers and early-stage startups grow fast through quality content marketing. A year into the business, I’d like to say that the results speak for themselves. ‍",1,0

61," Aloha, Failory! I’m Kalo, one of the founders of Encharge – a marketing automation tool that aims to connect all your marketing apps. My background is in interaction design. I built my first website when I was 11. It was a website for the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons. Yes, I’m that kind of a geek. I graduated in the UK with Graphic and Digital design.  Then I started working in one of the top digital marketing agencies in London with the bold name Elvis. I’ve done works for big boys like Magners, Virgin, Sky, NBA, Microsoft, UK Gov, and the list goes on. It was always a dream of mine to work in a cool, big digital agency, but I soon found out client work is not my cup of tea.  In 2013 I started my entrepreneurial journey – since then I’ve started at least 7 different startups – most of them failed miserably. I’m currently 27 and residing in sunny Sofia, Bulgaria where we build our latest startup Encharge with my co-founder Slav. ",1,0

I got my masters in Computer Architecture and my bachelors in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering. I did a bit of coding in college, but I didn’t pick up coding until I started working on personal projects. A few years ago, I built Eventloot, a SaaS platform for wedding planning professionals. It was inspired by the idea that most wedding planners at the time were using Google Docs and Google Spreadsheets to manage weddings for their clients. So, my partner and I decided that we could offer planners a solution that reflected the convenience of cloud-based SaaS products. ‍ What were your job duties at Eventloot? I was the co-founder and CEO of Eventloot. As a developer, I helped my partner who was the architect with development.

65," Hey Failory! Thanks for sitting down with me to do this interview. It’s great to have an opportunity to do a post-mortem on a failed business attempt and to share my experiences with other entrepreneurs. You are doing a great service to the startup community because it seems that talking about this subject in business is largely taboo. It seems like there’s a lot of lip service being paid to accepting failure, but in reality, we only tend to tolerate it from people who have already become successful at what they do, and now tell us their war stories. Where does that leave the rest of us who are still trying to find traction? There’s a martial arts maxim that goes “we either win, or we learn”. I feel that the business world could greatly benefit from adopting that some of that mindset. A few words about me: My name is Andrey Norin, I am a 35-year-old technologist and budding entrepreneur living in Queens, NY. I work as a senior enterprise technology consultant primarily in the financial services space. Currently, I am regrouping and getting ready to jump into another venture. About a year ago, I felt the urge to start working on creating my first legit startup. I have read somewhere that it takes an average of 6 business attempts or pivots to hit pay dirt, so I felt like it was my time to get in the game and start paying my dues. This is where ExploreVR.net comes into the picture. Last summer, I became quite interested in emerging technologies. At the time it seemed like Virtual Reality (VR) was finally getting ready for primetime. That made me want to explore various low-cost business models that I could potentially get into. Initially, I thought about starting a VR equipment rentals business. VR hardware is prohibitively expensive for the casual user (between $1,500 and $2,000), so I thought about purchasing some headsets and accessories that I could lease out in the short term. However, after having done the math, I realized that the business model I initially chose was very unattractive. Research showed that margins would be low, the risk of losing the initial investment was high, and the amount of manual labor around inventory management and customer service was unacceptable to me. So that led me to (what I thought was) a “genius idea”. I understood that not everyone would be as diligent as me in terms of doing the hard numbers in advance and appreciating the risks involved. There would be an emerging ecosystem of small Virtual Reality based businesses such as rentals, arcades, event providers and content creators. My goal would be to create a specialty directory site, not dissimilar to something like TripAdvisor, but focused 100% on Virtual Reality. Businesses would be able to list themselves for free, and users would go on the site, find the type of VR business they were interested in, leave reviews and book appointments directly from my site. As the site would get more users on it, I would create a paid membership tier that would allow businesses to highlight themselves in search, publish a larger number of events, etc.… Thus ExploreVR.net was born. I was the founder, the guy responsible for all the successes and the failures of the project. ‍",0,0
66," Hi, I’m Alan from the UK and my background is in business analysis, mainly for global organizations. Last year I decided to give this up and launch my own start-up which ultimately failed and I’m currently in the process of validating my next startup Flow Metrics. This came from wanting to reduce the amount of time I was spending finding and extracting information from Google Analytics during my failed startup Fantastic House Buyers, which I’m delighted to be able to talk to you about today! Fantastic House Buyers was an online service designed to improve the expensive and stressful experience of buying a house here in the UK. The premise was simple: a digital assistant that helped house buyers through the process and provided everything they needed in one place, including recommendations of professionals they would need during the process. I was the sole founder and employee on this and financed it myself. The business model was to take commission from recommending professional services and it seemed like a no-brainer with low operating costs and high potential revenue per user meant I only needed a small number of users to make it profitable. In hindsight, I committed a rookie mistake that led to its failure before it generated any revenue, one that should have been apparent and solvable from that start but took me a while to realize. ‍",0,0

I have been interviewed on Failory based on my failed startup (Hubrif) an online video platform for streaming award-winning and curated African short films. You can call it a Netflix for African short films. I figured I should balance up the equation by talking about my current startup Festivilia which is quite successful and I credit its success based on the lessons and experience gained in running Hubrif. Festivilia is a film festival submission and distribution platform that allows filmmakers and content providers to submit their films to a curated list of film festivals with just 1 form. Festivilia acts as the Festival Distributor for its clients helping to scout, source, submit to film festivals as well as manage all communications between these festivals and our clients. Basically, Festivilia saves filmmakers money and invaluable time by only submitting their films to festivals they have a higher chance of being accepted in as well as making sure their time is spent on other productive activities rather than spent filling numerous submission forms. ‍",1,0

71," I am a third-generation entrepreneur. I was born at a time when my grandfather and father had just closed down their clothes manufacturing business and had plans to start a hardware trading business. For the first 22 years of my life, I saw my father and grandfather build a sustainable business in a crowded market by vertically expanding and becoming a hardware manufacturing and trading business. During this time, I was rather unwittingly exposed to life as an entrepreneur as my father never wanted me to follow his path. Yet I learned a lot about negotiations with clients, resolution of co-founder conflicts, and the importance of having an open mind while overhearing his conversations and to a lesser extent having discussions with him. Seven years later, I am now a tech entrepreneur and am building a tech talent network called Flexiple to enable scaling startups to hire & work with the top-1% remote freelance developers and designers. We make it easy for tech startups to hire & work with quality tech talent who are on-boarded over the course of a multi-stage screening process.

Currently, we have two offices: one in Yerevan, Armenia, and another in Minsk, Belarus.  Flexy Global is out here to help shape companies’ visual identities professionally and aesthetically. We offer two working models. The first is project-based, where we make personalized design audits and propose a lump sum amount for the project. We chose this model because the service is suitable for most rising companies and startups particularly those developing new products or who know exactly what they want. And the second model is a subscription-based service. In this model, we provide the client with a full-time UI/UX designer with a minimum of three months’ commitment. This offer is suitable for companies and startups for a whole array of reasons: They could be working with sprints They’re in the process of ideation and don’t know exactly what they are doingThey’re pivoting or their in house designer cannot keep up with the projects and need helpThe company might simply be in the process of hiring a full-time designer Many scenarios fit our subscription model.

In fact, I’m working on contract development work now. Because of my experience with Graphite (and subsequently another startup called SimpleID), I get a bunch of interest from companies in the crypto space.  Graphite Docs was the catalyst for everything—learning to code, starting a business, entering the blockchain space. It was a privacy-focused alternative to Google Docs. Rather than create an account with a company that owned every piece of your data, Graphite allowed you to create user accounts anchored to the bitcoin blockchain, cryptographically owned by you, and created documents that were encrypted with keys only you had access to. And to top it all off, Graphite allowed you to store data wherever you want (Graphite didn’t even maintain a document database).  As a sole founder, my job was to write the code, market, sell, do demos, attend events, and pretty much everything else under the sun. Early on, I had no business model in mind. I really didn’t care if people even used it.

91," My name is Holger and I’m a designer-turned-engineer from Denmark. I studied design in school, but at the end of my schooling, I realized how hard it was to get programmers to code the things I designed, so I ended up learning to code myself, which is mainly what I do today. I have always been interested in the startup world, which initially led me to work as a designer at a long-forgotten startup in San Francisco. After that, I attended Hacker School (now called Recurse Center), which is akin to a writer’s retreat, but for programmers. During my time at Hacker School, I really went into programming and I ended up working as a front-end programmer for a startup in Denmark. A couple of years later, I co-founded a startup in NY called Slang which was a marketplace for sneakers and streetwear. Our startup ended up sharing the same story as a lot of other startups and after 3 tough years of constant work, dedication, and ups and downs, we had to throw in the towel. Through all that, I’ve always been building smaller projects on the site. They were the best way to keep learning new languages and technologies. This led me to building one of the most popular calculators on the Mac App Store (initially built in Objective-C and later in Rubymotion) and a Solitaire card game website (built with React and other JS-technologies) where people play 3 million games of FreeCell, Spider, and Klondike Solitaire each month.

93," My name is Nicolas and I am 32 years old. A year ago, I quit my job as an IT support engineer and moved to Spain to pursue my dream of running an online business. A dream to have an influence on our world, to matter, and to have somehow control over my life. HashtagPirate was my first attempt. It was an Instagram hashtag search engine. It was unique as it let you find very targeted posts, whether you wanted them for travel, for business or for leisure. By entering, for example, 2 hashtags into the search bar, you were shown only posts that contained both hashtags in the caption. This first attempt failed hard, and funnily enough, the reason was out of my control. Before I even could start monetizing my search engine with ADs, Instagram was bought by Facebook, and on June 2016, they decided to block any search requests to their API, destroying the core of my service. ‍",0,0
94," My name is Alejandro Betancourt Lopez, and I am a business professional from Venezuela who has launched or funded several businesses. I have served as President of Hawkers Sunglasses since October 2016. I learned of the Spanish start-up company when its founders contacted me to lead a financing round worth approximately 50M euros in early 2016. Hawkers immediately began to scale with my support, and the four founders offered me the role of company president a few months later. The biggest element of Hawkers’ success has been our investment in influencer marketing. The company’s founders, Alex Moreno, David Moreno, Pablo Sanchez Lozano, and Iñaki Soriano had achieved success with influencer marketing before I came on board. Unfortunately, they were dealing with financial struggles that threatened the future of the young company by 2016. We worked together to revamp Hawkers’ influencer marketing strategy by forming partnerships with people who had a large social media following. Hawkers provides them with a free pair of sunglasses and a promo code for their followers. The strategy has been wildly successful, and we have expanded the Hawkers brand throughout Europe, North America, and Asia even as we increase our Facebook advertising. ‍",1,0

104," My name is Tobi Ogunwande, a lover of film, tech and good food. I am a self-taught filmmaker and a startup co-founder of 2 startups. One failed (Hubrif) and the other is profitable (Festivilia). My first company was Hubrif a curated video on demand platform for streaming high quality African short films (basically, the Netflix of African short films). The idea for Hubrif came as a result of my frustration in having to discover and watch very good African short films. I was getting ready to shoot my first film in 2015 after a few months of building my theoretical knowledge of filmmaking, which I did reading eBooks and watching Youtube videos. I wanted to watch some short films about my topic already made which was about female molestation but couldn't find. Spending so much time searching on youtube and still couldn't find what I was looking for. I went on to just shoot the film the way I could. Fortunately, it was quite successful in its festival runs, a few of which I was able to attend. One of the benefits of attending these film festivals was networking opportunities. When I began to hear of similar challenges by other young filmmakers, with my love and passion for technology, this convinced me to build Hubrif. Shortly after the death of Hubrif, I launched Festivilia a film festival distribution and submission platform that matches films to the right film festivals and allows filmmakers to submit to them by just filling one submission form. The platform’s goal is to save filmmakers the stress and burden of blindly submitting their works to film festivals by matching films to relevant festivals and submitting automatically, increasing their chances of selection and saving them time and money. Festivilia is currently profitable and its success has been partly due to the lessons learned in building Hubrif.  I was working as an IT Support / Business Development Personnel for another startup called Cartehub (www.cartehub.com) a Multi-merchant e-commerce platform for African goods when I founded Festivilia. It's interesting to note that I built the website (festivilia.com) from scratch after taking a few months to learn website designing (on my own of course through youtube videos). ‍",0,0

109," Hey Failory! My name is Andrew Askins, I’m a jack-of-all-trades from Charleston, SC. My story is a little different from many of the others here because our product failed, but our company is still going strong. I started my company Krit with two of my best friends in 2014. At the time I started Krit I was still a full-time student (I was actually studying abroad in Scotland for the first 3 months). It was a strange time because I was running a company but wasn’t legally about to drink in the states.   In 2015 we launched our first product Ink. Ink was a tool that made it super easy for freelancers to create contracts and get them signed online. Users got 3 contracts for free and could then buy packs to get more or a monthly subscription. We got a couple thousand free users, but ultimately got burnt out before we could make the business model work. Along the way, people had started reaching out to us to help them build their products. So, in October of 2015, we shut down Ink and started focusing full-time on consulting. Today, I’m still growing Krit. We’re now completely focused on helping non-technical founders at early stage startups build and launch products of their own (while avoiding the mistakes we made along the way). ‍",0,0

113," Hey! I am Jasmeet. A software engineer by qualification and an entrepreneur by passion. I started my first company, an IT service company located in India, around 10 years back (the company still survives and helps me pay my bills). Few years after my company started, I started working on a few ideas with friends. Some ideas clicked, some failed but the experience gained in trying new things was immense. Around 2 years ago, I discovered Quora and started writing answers related to entrepreneurship and startups there. I noticed, my readers there loved the experience and the stories I had to share. Quora also got me hooked to writing and I started my blog. I have been actively writing on Quora and my blog since then - sharing stories, experiences, and learnings from my entrepreneurial journey. Along with writing, I also started training working professionals and college students in digital marketing.  In the next few months, I am taking an exit from my current company. Yes! The same I.T company that helps me pay the bills. I want to take up writing full time and train people on entrepreneurship and digital marketing. But let’s get into the failure story of Jobridge, one of those businesses that I build that didn’t click and failed. Jobridge was one of the first job portals in India that helped job seekers start working in Indian industrial cities. The company mixed an online and offline business model to provide memberships to jobseekers and sell job postings to companies. All paid job seekers got vacancy notifications before anyone else and their resumes were sent first to the employers. I was a co-founder and my job consisted in creating the business plan, marketing strategy and close sales. The real USP of the portal was the ability to even cater to those who were not internet savvy. But soon we decided to grow the business by creating franchises in cities like ours. We approached small business owners in these cities and pitched them the following model: They could create a Jobridge franchisee, becoming the front face of the company in the city. They would have to get us paid job postings and jobseeker registrations. In exchange, they would get a commission on every sale closed by them. We were in charge of handling all the back-end operations. The investment from their end was very minimal. All we asked was some branding in their existing shop and someone who was trained enough to work on the web-based system built by us for franchisees. ‍",0,0
114," Hey! My name is Travis Peterson. I make prank gifts but I am mostly known for musical greeting cards that have no off-switch and loop non-stop, on purpose, until the battery dies. The genesis of this company started when I was 8 years old and my dad called while he was traveling to tell me he won the lottery. Then he said, “April Fools!” Every year he had a new joke and I fell for it all the time. Joker Greeting started with making prank musical greeting cards but we now focus on all gifts and fun pranks. We prefer fun and funny gifts and not a**hole pranks. We want both sides laughing together. Joker Greeting is based in Irvine, California and we have some workers in Salt Lake City, Utah and my warehouse is based in Utah as well. The company manufactures in China and works with another team on product design. I am the only full-time employee, as well as the president and co-founder. I do it all: Building and maintaining the website on Shopify, talking with customers, business development with wholesale clients, creating videos for ads on Facebook and for the web, creating any new products, and managing the process towards launching of new products and categories. I could probably continue listing more jobs that I handle, with the exception of bookkeeping, packing, shipping and manufacturing. Most sells come mainly from my website, where I sell directly to my customers, but I also sell to other online stores and catalogs. It is a pretty basic business model. From there, I try to build out more product categories that are based 100% on Joker Greeting ideas. Right now, I have three product categories, but I should have two more really soon. Cross-selling should help me lock in new customers and grow organically. My goal is $1M in sales. This is very doable goal within two years. It’s not Facebook money but I am okay with that. ‍",1,0

I have an MBA from Columbia (NY) and London Business School and I am based between London and Bucharest, Romania. ‍ Kamua is an automation centric video repurposing studio, based in the cloud. So you just need a browser and wifi and you can use our AI to create videos really fast that would otherwise take you a long time and require you to learn advanced software that you would have to run on a powerful computer. Kamua is best used for repurposing existing video content - for example taking a YouTube dance video and converting it for TikTok using our AI tracking. You have to see it in action to fully understand what it does, but basically if you have a video filmed in landscape mode of someone dancing, our AI tracks the dancer and can crop the video so it works really well in vertical mode like you see on TikTok and Snapchat, IG stories, etc. I’m the CEO and one of the two founders, along with an amazing engineer, Radu Amarie, from Bucharest, Romania. My job is to make sure that I have the most talented engineers and product people I can find, make sure they are happy, and that the product we created fits the needs of our target customers.

Before becoming a Software Engineer, I was an aspiring professional Go Player and became the #1 player of my generation in all South America. The Game of Go was my passion in my teens and 20’s. I wanted to make a living with the game and making it professionally was extremely competitive: thousands of players would play tournaments every year and less than 15 people world-wide would achieve the title of professional. So I decided to build a Go Server that rivaled the current king, that was implemented with borderline expired technology. I founded Kaya.gs along with a partner: from nothing to a playable server in about 2 months back in 2011. One of the biggest challenges was the business model. Playing on a server is free, so most servers live by the Freemium model. Some features and services would be unlocked with a membership. Because we would take a long time to build a competitive freemium model and to bootstrap with that strategy, we chose to crowdfund the project. There was a huge need for a new space, that would develop new features faster and be more modern than the current options: the crowdfunding campaign let us get funding in the order of 20.000U$S.  ‍",0,0

120," Hi there Rich, thanks for taking the time to hear our story! I’m a fan of your work at Failory and enjoy learning from the other entrepreneurs. Currently, my business partner Antonio (Ari) Iaccarino and I have launched Ridj-it , an online carpool platform for outdoor enthusiasts, matching those who need a ride to outdoor adventures (think hiking, skiing, camping, horseback riding, wine tasting, rock climbing, yoga, kayaking, rappelling, and even axe throwing!) with someone who can get them to these destinations and back. So far, this endeavour has definitely not been a failure like KnowNet (which I will get to shortly!), and in fact, we’ve seen substantial growth in the number of users and overall use in the last few months. We are operating out of the Boston area and look to expand to other East Coast cities. Before jumping into the KnowNet debacle, I’d like to touch upon how we arrived at Ridj-it - I think it will be a good way to introduce ourselves and offer an insight into what makes us tick. Ridj-it was an idea that we conceived on the way back from a hiking trip in the White Mountains in my then car, a 1997 Camry that graciously did not fall apart despite the more than 300,000 miles it racked up or from whatever was causing the repetitive popping noises on the rear right (or the entire rear, if we are being honest). At the time, I was going to grad school at night, studying epidemiology and biostatistics while working full time as a medical researcher, and Ari was an adjunct professor teaching ESL students in several schools and also tutoring. An escape to the outdoors was a welcome break from our crazy day-to-day routine, plus we loved hiking. After bagging three peaks in a grueling hike, Ari and I mused about how our hiking trips were really just limited to us and anyone else who could hitch a ride with me. Ari opined that at least only a few souls had to put up with my terrible music playlist, which consisted of whatever Boston stations that could still be salvaged as we went North on I-93, a rock station that kept playing old Green Day and The Offspring, or any other frequencies of garbled, static-y mix of bluegrass, sports radio, and Bible recitations. He made a good point. Ari then posed a curious question: how does someone like his students, who are internationals without American driver’s licenses and awareness of the area’s outdoor offerings but who enjoy activities like hiking, able to easily get to the Whites for a hike? I pondered for a bit but couldn’t provide an answer and neither could he, which is rare because both of us have a lot to say about everything. I then thought about my grad student friends who enjoyed hiking, and it turns out that they relied on me, both for access and awareness. So, if I were to not go hiking, nor could they. I also reflected on various meetups, social and outing clubs, and college organizations - the traditional gatekeepers to these types of activities true, these groups do enable organized hiking events, but everything  is on the group leadership’s terms, the events for many of these groups are relatively infrequent, membership can be pricey, and there’s no reliable and consistent transit available apart from hoping someone would offer a ride or on the off chance that one of the groups booked a bus or van. We learned later that these groups are often steeped in unwelcoming social cliques and layered in unnecessary top-down bureaucracy, making accessibility to the outdoors even more untenable for folks like Ari’s students and my friends. But it wasn’t just internationals and grad students with large barriers to entry a lack of reliable and consistent transport from an urban core like Boston to various popular destinations in far-flung places like a trailhead in the Whites would also impact a large percentage of urban dwellers, which includes those who have eschewed car ownership as a necessity of city living, people of color who have been systematically deprived from accessing and enjoying outdoor recreation, and young, transient professionals who find owning a car to be unnecessary and costly. Through various conversations with each other, we asked ourselves the following: What if we could provide both a direct link and a bypass via an online platform that fosters a reliable and consistent (and affordable) transport program to hard-to-reach outdoor destinations and a network to folks that share similar hobbies, that doesn’t require engaging the tribal ingroup/outgroup politics of the gatekeepers? We agreed to bring this concept to fruition over burgers and milkshakes at our post-hike go-to diner in New Hampshire. Two years later, after research, experimentation, and refinement of our concept, Ridj-it has a fully functioning website with an active and growing user base, a great deal due to Alex Nikitin, who joins Ridj-it as a co-founder and lead developer, and to Liz, Nick, and John for their help in marketing, product development, and graphic design. Ridj-it was named after Franconia Ridge, the trail that we hiked that day. While working on growing Ridj-it and ensuring that it fulfills its mission, I also work full time as a data analyst in the healthcare space, Ari is a public school teacher, and Alex is a software developer at a local university.   Prior to our work with Ridj-it, Ari and I also embarked on an idea for an on-demand tutoring platform called KnowNet. The idea, which came to us about four years ago, was to enable those who needed tutoring to quickly find a tutor to offer guidance for an issue that the former encountered during the course of study. KnowNet never took off because a simple SWOT analysis revealed that there were too many competitors with advanced products and VC backing. We failed before we could even begin. ‍",0,0

Fast forward to today and my day to day business has become my own mobile personal training business where I primarily service athletes and software entrepreneurs. For the last 8 months, I have been working on a side hustle that I was hoping one day would become my future full-time job, Kopely. Kopely was a mobile-based stress relief app designed for the consumer market.  Our mission was to provide practical and tactical stress management tools to our consumers leveraging an array of proven psychological methods like relaxation therapy, cognitive psychology, and acceptance, and commitment therapy. How were we different? Our app was focusing on how to actually help people manage their stress by using prompting them actionable coping strategies when they were in the moment of experiencing a stressor and by educating the consumer with perspective-shifting psychology to shift their mindset toward optimism to prevent the ill effects of future stressors.  As the Founder of Kopely, I was juggling several hats - managing the vision with our small team of developers, finding strategic partners like stress relief experts, and executing on our marketing strategy to onboard early adopters prior to our BETA launch The business model was based on our competitors' like Headspace and Calm freemium pricing options. We were going to release a two-week free trial with tools to assess your stress pre and post-trial than a premium full version for a monthly fee.  ‍",0,0

124," Hello! I’m Deepak. I grew up in Ecuador, my parents are Indian, and I was born in Kenya! I came to the US 7 years ago for college. Up until a year ago, most of my experience was in finance, but was always inclined to start my own business. I quit my last job at BofAML to take a few months off and try to start my own thing. About a year ago, I started Legaats(social platform where baby boomers share & document nuggets of wisdom to pass on to future generations). After 7 months full time, I decided to evolve the business to what now is The Lobby. The Lobby is a marketplace where job candidates buy 1-on-1 calls with employees at top investment banks to get personalized recruiting advice and the chance to earn an employee referral.  ",0,0
125," Hi! My name is Sol Broady, and I’m a 21-year-old senior at Columbia University in NYC. For the past three years, I have worked as the founder and CEO of Leilo, the world’s first dedicated relaxation CPG. Simply put, we are on a mission to de-stress a stressed-out world. Everyone knows where to go when it comes to energy or caffeine--soda, coffee, tea, energy drinks...the list goes on and on. But what products can you turn to when you need the opposite effect? What are you doing to relax, take the edge off after a long day, or balance out your caffeine fixation?  That’s where Leilo comes in. Using all-natural ingredients known for their anxiolytic properties, we provide “calm in a can” whenever you need it most. Our star ingredient is kava, a root native to the South Pacific that has been enjoyed for millennia for the euphoric and relaxing sensation it produces.  Crucially, our proprietary formula gives consumers a tangible effect without using any alcohol or marijuana derivatives. When you consider this alongside the fact that Leilo is vegan, kosher, halal, non-GMO, and as low as 10 calories, you could say we’ve made relaxation responsible. We’re proud to have created a product that not only makes people feel good but one that they can feel good about drinking in the first place.  Since our first flavor launch in March 2020, we’ve enjoyed pretty rapid success on both the e-commerce and retail fronts. Though the pandemic presented some obstacles in getting off the ground, we pushed through and are happy to report that we’re currently sold across 200+ retailers in 20 states, and are adding more by the day! With some awesome new flavors and function-specific variants coming out soon, we can’t wait to continue spreading relaxation across the nation, now and for years to come. ",1,0
126," My name is Guillaume, I’m 28 years old living in Paris and I’m the CEO and Co-Founder of lemlist, a cold email platform that allows sales teams to book more meetings thanks to the power of personalization. As a CEO, I’m taking care of management, strategy and sales, while my two technical co-founders handle the tech side. Before starting lemlist, I actually had a lead generation agency called LeadGuru, where I was essentially helping B2B startups scale and acquire more customers using cold emailing. Essentially, we were doing all the sales prospecting for our customers and we were asking them to pay per lead we brought them. After using various tools on the market, I felt pretty frustrated with the lack of personalization they were offering. That’s when I started building lemlist. We launched two and a half years ago, in 2018, after I sold my LeadGuru shares and stopped working on it. We currently have 8000+ customers worldwide, including well-known companies like Zendesk. It’s been quite the journey and we’ve put a lot of work into it. ‍  lemtalk ($60,000 ARR) is basically a live chat that allows you to connect all your messaging channels directly into Slack. For example, if someone sends an email to support, you can see it and reply all within Slack. This product was actually built before lemlist by my two co-founders. However, we decided to move it to what we now call the “lempire”, which is our series of products. Regarding lempod ($220,000 ARR), it allows you to get more views and more reach on LinkedIn. It was part of a problem we were facing, as every time I was posting on LinkedIn, I was copying my post URL and then asking the people I work with to engage.  So I once thought: “Damn, this is so stupid to do every time I publish a post. I’m wasting like so much time”. In 3-5 days we had the first version and we found many people had the same issue. We shared it in some groups and after two months, we had 1,000 users. That’s when we started charging for it and growing the price 25%/month. Since then, we have hired someone to work specifically on the product. We have processes documented on Notion in terms of growth, SEO, partnerships, communities, making everything much easier. Anyway, I had to hire someone, as well, to train this new employee. Right now, we're a team of ten. There are three co-founders, two people handling lemlist support, one person focused on growth, two more developers and one growth marketer for both lempod and lemtalk.",1,0

135," Hi there, I have sort of a strange and varied background. I started off studying video game design at college and messed around with everything from animation to cognitive science. But my game development career didn’t really go as planned. I joined Lockpick Entertainment in my sophomore year and stayed with them a year after graduating. It was not to last, however. After college, I instead ended up working on the design of software tools because I kept getting bogged down in poorly designed fundamentals. Back in those days, game development tools were woefully underdeveloped, and when I switched over to the Web industry I realized the same was true for all software tools.  Currently, I’m working on BlankPage, a motivational service that helps writers finish their first drafts, and Kod.app which is a full Javascript IDE for the iPad Pro. ‍",0,0
136," Hi! I’m the founder, engineer, designer, customer support, and all-in-all one-woman team at Lunch Money, a subscription-based personal finance & budgeting web app. I started learning basic web programming (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript) at the tender age of 13 after my older sister suggested that I try my hand at making websites instead of wasting my time playing online games (Neopets!). I was instantly hooked and I remember spending my mornings, evenings, and entire summers in front of the computer with Paint Shop Pro and Notepad crafting all sorts of different websites. My love for computers only grew fonder over the years. Eventually, I attended the University of Waterloo in Canada and I graduated with a degree in computer engineering. I’m based in Toronto as a digital snowmad, meaning I aim to spend the harsh Canadian winters abroad in Asia. Last year, my husband and I spent 4 months in Fukuoka, Japan, where the first iteration of Lunch Money was built. This year, my husband and I are in Taipei, Taiwan. ‍  I spent the first 4.5 years of my career in Silicon Valley where I worked as a software engineer at Twitter for almost 4 years, experiencing both its startup heydeys and post-IPO growing pains. Eventually, I quit and co-founded a start-up with my roommate in the pet health space. We worked on the company together for a year, during which we went through the first batch of YC Fellowship and 500 Startups (both are seed accelerators). Shortly into 500 Startups, I came into a general realization that this wasn’t where I wanted to be, especially not as a 26-year-old with so many aspirations beyond the Silicon Valley dream. They say the average age of a start-up is 7 years before it dies or gets acquired, and it spooked me to think the rest of my 20s could be spent chasing this singular dream and “maybe” or “maybe not” succeeding. Eventually, I made the difficult decision of leaving the start-up. My co-founder was more than capable of running the company on her own and we parted ways on good terms. Burn-out is a very real feeling and can catalyze some pretty crazy changes. I ended up diving really deep into minimalism, no longer wanting to bear the responsibility of anything aside from the minimum necessities. I gave away or sold almost all my stuff. I said goodbye to my friends and the city I called home for the last 5 years with no regrets and I was ready to finally start living life on my own schedule. After spending 2 months at home reconnecting with my parents with a newly-refreshed mind, I ended up on an 8-month adventure abroad where I deliberately sought out experiences that would take me far away from anything computer or tech-related. Here’s a sample of what I ended up doing: I stayed at a farm in rural northeastern Thailand where I helped herd sheep at sunrise,I went through a medical emergency in Thailand and experienced first-class medical care,I was the first tourist in a small Thai village known for its monkey forest and went Thai-style camping nearbyI lived with a family in the middle of the mountains and experienced rural French culture,I worked as a bartender/waitress at a restaurant in rural Burgundy in exchange for lodging I also did some good ol’ fashioned traveling through amazing cities such as Lyon, Tallin, Stockholm, and Copenhagen. At the end of it all, my parents met me in France and I wrapped up my sabbatical by showing them around my new favorite country for 2.5 weeks. I flew back to Toronto and started the next phase of my life in the city I grew up in and was joined by my now-husband who was also on his own sabbatical during this time. We spent the first few months back in Toronto enjoying each other’s company and re-discovering Toronto as residents. By this point, I hadn’t done any programming in almost 1.5 years and as is expected in the world of software development, a lot had changed.  For the next two months, I went to a coffee shop every day to catch up. I decided to learn React and I eventually released a fully-functioning app to the App Store– a Chinese phrasebook app inspired by my own travels. It has almost no downloads aside from my mom. While I didn’t gain any riches from this app, I did gain the skills necessary to pick up some freelancing jobs. Through my network, I worked as a freelance software engineer for three different companies over the span of the next 2 years, each having different roles and responsibilities ranging from web development to full-stack engineering.  My husband and I were having a great time in Toronto but we realized we didn’t love it so much during the winter. We were both fully remote in our jobs, so why not take the opportunity to scratch our itch to travel and go abroad during that time?  In 2019, we kicked off our “digital snowmad” lifestyle by spending a winter abroad in Fukuoka, Japan. During my time there, I was able to work on a few personal goals (learn Japanese cuisine, learn elementary Japanese). I was also continuing to freelance for 2 different companies while starting to work on what is today known as Lunch Money!",1,1
137," Hi Failory, thanks so much for this interview. I’m Fabrizio, an Italian maker, designer, and filmmaker, currently working on Mailbrew full-time. I’m from the South of Italy, and I’ve always been passionate about creativity and art. I studied filmmaking in Bologna, I have a background in 3D graphics, I’ve briefly worked in VFX and I’ve directed a short film. I also love photography and, in short, I’m obsessed with anything visual. I’ve co-founded my startup Superlinear with Francesco in late 2018 when we decided to quit our job in a fast-growing tech startup based in Milan to go all-in on our side-projects. Me and Francesco originally met on Twitter a few years ago and started working together on Boxy, an Inbox by Gmail client for Mac, without ever meeting in person. Boxy was a huge success and the beginning of a lasting friendship for me and Francesco. In the company we joined (and left) together, we worked on apps used by millions of people, and an app I’ve designed was chosen by Apple to be installed and showcased in iPhone in Apple Stores worldwide. It was a crazy and beautiful experience, so quitting was a tough decision.  Before deciding to quit that company, we actually launched a new side-project, Boxy Suite, a premium Gmail client for Mac. The launch was really successful, so after a few months, we finally decided to quit the job and co-found Superlinear. Quitting a nice tech job in the business center of Milan was the scariest choice of my life, and the first few months after that were pretty confusing. My whole 2019 was a rollercoaster, and me and Francesco didn’t just work a lot, but also traveled more, and embraced more personal endeavours as well. Luckily between our personal savings and the revenues from the Boxy Suite launch (~40k USD in the first 3 months), we had some leeway to get things started on our own. Currently, our main focus is on Mailbrew. We launched it on March 3 after around 6 months in private beta, which felt like an eternity. Mailbrew is our most ambitious project to date: it’s an app that saves you hours of time by sending email digests about your favorite topics, on your schedule.  Users can pick their favorite sources (Twitter accounts, Subreddits, Blogs, anything), select a schedule, and receive beautiful emails with the best content from these sources — this way they can unplug from feeds and stop checking multiple websites every day. I reached out to DHH asking him to try it during the beta, and he’s been really supportive since then. He even tweeted:  “I've been using Mailbrew to keep up with Twitter peeps who don't post often, but whom I'd really hate to miss what they have to say. It's pretty awesome. In many ways, Twitter-over-email is the healthier Twitter!” Having DHH as a user and testimonial was incredibly motivating while working on the beta, and in these few months we’ve found other engaged users which fell in love with Mailbrew, and that gave us confidence that we were on the right path. Our very first paying user was Pat Walls. We’ve always been inspired by his projects and work ethic, so it was great to have that kind of validation early on. ",1,0

Our HQ is in Bratislava, Slovakia but I was born and raised in the marvelous city of Banska Stiavnica. Seriously, you should visit it someday :) I started programming when I was about twelve. I dreamed of developing a product that would attract thousands of people. The D-day came when I launched the very first version of KWFinder in 2014.

Our mission is to make SEO easy for everyone so the data, UX and user interface are all about that.

142," I am Ali and I advise companies on product development and building data-focused services. I also have a podcast focused on groundbreaking graduate research called For Inquisitive Minds and another on building businesses called Serial Entrepreneurship with Ali & Upile. I am currently building an accessibility and advance care-related startup called Eberus. I also advise an emerging market fintech called Oraan. I started MealSurfers when I was 23 years old and ran it for about 2 years before selling it to a private fund. While selling the business sounds like a success story, deep down I know I could have done more. Ultimately the model, environment, team and timing were all factors in the sale. We were fortunate that we were one of the only companies executing this model that managed to sell our assets and earn an above average return on investment. Before I tell you my story, I’ll explain what MealSurfers was and why I started it. MealSurfers started as a way to connect home cooks with people who wanted to buy their food. I thought places with high population density like downtown Toronto, could use this model to meet their neighbours and find healthy food at a reasonable price. Some would say it’s like Uber for food, but it’s a little different, as I argued for TechVibes. The initial business model was to take a cut of the transactions but there were a number of pivots that changed this. As the business grew, we experimented with catering (charging businesses of all sizes for meals), food delivery for smaller food shops, charging for small food shops to set up their businesses (similar to cloud kitchens in a way) and running events. I’d argue we never focused on any of these revenue models long enough to see success - mostly because we started to bleed money. ‍ ‍ While I was the founder, I acknowledge I couldn’t have done this on my own, and I want to give my gratitude to my day ones - Justin, Etan, Halima, Neil and Ankit. While this was not the entire team, they all played a huge role in shaping and moving the vision to where it ended up. As I write this, I end each question with a ‘TlDR’. If you want the full answer you can read it, but if you’re in a rush, just check out the end. ‍",1,0
143," Hi, I'm Kevin Wang! I've been based in Atlanta for the past 6 years after starting my undergrad at Georgia Tech. I was the founder and CEO of Melon, a food delivery startup aimed at being more efficient and cost effective for users and restaurants alike. Our model was focused on streamlining the process by offering the most popular items and most popular times, allowing us to pool many orders at once, reducing time taken during trips to drop off items. Here's how it worked. Each week, we would create a unique, curated menu of the best local restaurants and their popular items that would last well for delivery. Our lunch drop off was between 12-12:30, dinner between 6:30-7. Users would pre-order before 11am, and 5pm for lunch and dinner, respectively, and all orders would be picked up and dropped off in the shortest trip possible. This enabled us to pool many more orders than would be possible compared to on demand. Our business model was dependent on restaurant commissions. We could charge zero delivery fees because pooling 10+ items at once with one driver would pay for the driving time with just 10% of the total order cost.. Food delivery uniquely has three segments to balance: the customer, restaurant, and driver. Here are their respective benefits under this model. As we expanded, we had to get creative to effectively deliver many items within a short time frame. We adopted a sort of miniature warehouse distribution style, where a car (like a truck on the highway) would pick up 50-60 items from the restaurant further out, and meet with other cars at a common point (the warehouse) to pass off 10-15 items each for them to make short stops downtown and around campus. This allowed us to achieve a high capacity of items delivered in a short timeframe with fewer miles driven, benefitting consumer price-point as well as environmental impact. My vision for the company expanded far beyond this concept, into a service that would involve collaboration between users and local businesses to further improve efficiency, reduce costs, and allow small businesses to thrive using a delivery supply chain that truly worked for them. To users, we would be the one-stop-shop marketplace for your local favorites (food, crafts, groceries), with the best prices. Our team was small, but close, with my brother Jeff, and a good friend Jack Olinde, and we were all technical founders. I led our business development, customer discovery, as well as technical aspects like design and software development. We all wore many hats. My day-to-day varied widely from fixing bugs and implementing new features to onboarding restaurants and collaborating with other entrepreneurs, but I tried to keep a main focus each day to reduce time lost from context switching. Now that Melon is shut down and school is closed, I am actively looking for roles related with software engineering, data science, and machine learning. ‍",0,0
144," Hey, thanks for having me! I’m the Founder of MentorCruise.com, a mentorship service for people in tech. I’m 23 years old, living in Zurich, Switzerland. I launched MentorCruise when I was only 20 years old, working on it during an incredibly long commute that I had. The idea behind MentorCruise is simple: To reach their goals, people need support and accountability. Both can be provided by a mentor. However, good mentors are sparse, and getting someone to formally engage with you in a mentor-mentee relationship almost always only happens in schools and organized work relationships. So that’s where we swoop in – we have around 500 mentors on file with what they are happy to provide for mentees, and how much it’s going to cost them. Other than other services, we don’t rely on sessions, paid calls, or by-the-minute billing to do so – you sign up with a flat monthly fee and have access to your mentor when you need it. We take a cut. As a solo founder, I have my hands full with all areas of the business. Today, I have two part-time helpers in customer support and development, but there is still a lot to do when it comes to product, growth, marketing, and community support. ‍",1,0

I’ve worked my way through a number of startups, the majority successful with one notable failure, to a point where I now find myself at EmailOctopus, an email marketing platform, as COO. That notable failure was Mongoose, a sports equipment manufacturer, which was most widely known for its introduction of a radical new cricket bat in 2009. At Mongoose I managed the production and distribution of those bats, sourcing the bats from contracted manufacturers in Sussex, Huntingdon and a place called Meerut in India. The business model was relatively simple, initially launching as a direct-to-consumer brand in 2009 selling via our website, before moving into retailers in 2010.

Whilst I’m now back in the city (and able to get a tan again), the enthusiasm for trying something new, and a little crazy, hasn’t disappeared. I’m an ‘off the chart’ extrovert who loves meeting and working with new people. I’ve just tipped over the hill to 30, and live back in Auckland, trying to get out as much as possible on the weekends whether that is exploring our country’s beautiful backyard, or catching a surf on the West Coast.  I’ve since branched out to start my own technology marketplace business, My Auto Shop. We’re reimagining how car maintenance is done in NZ by partnering with fully vetted, MTA approved garages and we make it easy to find, compare, and book the best mechanic for customers around New Zealand. We’ve essentially become the ‘Airbnb for car maintenance and repairs’ and a really easy way for Kiwi’s to sort out the hassles of getting their car repaired or serviced.  Through My Auto Shop, you can schedule what maintenance you’re needing, pick a workshop that suits you based on reviews, receive the price upfront, and then schedule a pick up for your car by an independent, E-Scooter wielding, driver from wherever suits you. ‍",1,0

The idea was to provide local authorities with a tool to build relationships with their residents: ask for opinions, gather feedback and have a conversation.  We wanted to build a SaaS platform that cities could access using a subscription model. I was one of the three co-founders and didn’t have a title since I thought calling myself the CEO in a five-person company (our peak at some point) is such a brag.

156," Hey! I’m Jake Lang, born and raised in New Hampshire. I’m 28 years old, I now live in Massachusetts with my fiancée Brooke (we’re getting married in June 2020) and our two Great Danes Miley and Charlie. I build online businesses, it’s what I love doing. I love looking for a niche, finding an opportunity, and delivering a solution to an underserved market. I’ve started six online businesses ranging from online courses to membership sites, and I have a top-selling book on Amazon for my niche.  My big project now is to continue building businesses. I will be starting two new businesses this year and sharing my journey at The Entrepreneur Ride Along where I’ll share the ups, downs, wins, and mistakes of building each business. But that’s not what I’m here to talk about… Today I’m here to talk about my biggest failure as an entrepreneur. I like to call it my $16,000 learning lesson (AKA a $16,000 loss). That failure came in 2017 when I was launching my Amazon FBA business. The business that I called “NE Lounge”. It was supposed to have a dual meaning standing for “New England” lounger or lounge “Anywhere”. Get it, the letters “N-E” pronounced sounds like “Any”? Yeah, a stupid name that no one else understood either. But that doesn’t matter! Don’t let the name of your business hold you back from moving forward, you can always re-brand later. Anyways. I was launching an Amazon FBA product. I was the founder and sole proprietor of NE Lounge, which was intended to be an Amazon FBA store selling inflatable products. My first product was an inflatable lounger, the NE Lounge Inflatable Lounger. You can see inflatable loungers on Amazon. It’s a bit of a fad product. It’s essentially an inflatable couch. You hold the lounger and run to fill it up with air, then tie it closed and you have a big inflatable pouch to lounge on great for camping or hanging at the beach. I had big goals for this product. I did lots of market research, I saw what was wrong with the competition. My plan was to come in and sell a premium inflatable lounger, one that was bigger, more durable, and stayed inflated longer. I would price myself on the high end of the competition, I would charge $50 per lounger when most of the competition charged $20 to $40 per lounger. At about $20 cost per item, and charging $50 per sale, I would profit $30 per each inflatable lounger that I sold. If I could sell just 100 per month (around 3 units per day) I would net $3,000 profit per month. Combined with the revenue I was generating from my other online businesses, which was around $7,000 per month, with this new Amazon FBA business I’d be able to hit my income goal of $10,000 per month. I told myself, if I generated $10,000 per month from my online businesses, I could comfortably leave my day job and pursue my dream of full-time entrepreneurship. Well, that was the goal at least… ‍",0,0
157," Hey there! My name is Kevin Pereira and I am the founder of NerdPilots. But my entrepreneurial journey didn’t start with NerdPilots. During the last few years, I have built multiple businesses on different industries. One of the first ones was a house cleaning company based in San Jose, California, which turned to be pretty big and I sold it. It is called InstaMaids (it’s still up right now) and they about a million dollars per year. After this, I decided to go on vacation for a little bit until my business partner, Rohan, and I started a company called Wet Shave Club, a pretty big wet shaving goodies subscription box company. We had around two thousand members paying us like $30 a month. The most that we did with that company was $100,000 in December of 2014 or 2015. Then, I started a SAS company called GrooveJar, which I successfully sold. Lately, I've been involved in a company called Innclusive and another one called TripLaunch, which is a software for people who run their own group trips. Another of my businesses that is great to mention is Convert27, a powerful marketing software for local businesses that is mostly used by Launch27’s users right now. And we have the objective of including some more products into Launch27 software. Launch27 and TripLaunch are making thirty thousand dollars per month and Convert27 is doing over three thousand dollars a month right now (but that's going to be growing in a small period of time). And finally, I run NerdPilots, which generates somewhere between 15 to 25 thousand dollars a month right now, but our goal by the end of 2019 is to get it into a $100,000/month. So that's where I am at and that's pretty much what I'm working on. I have a couple of other projects, such as a website that I'm going to be starting up soon for where I will sell aviation-related things and maybe one or two other SaaS. I run all these businesses living in Big Bear Lake, California, a little mountain community about two hours from Los Angeles. But let’s move into NerdPilots. As I've built so many different products and websites, people have been always asking me to use my designers and developers. So, I thought: “let's create a little agency where people can get a website built or if they have any website issues, they can come to us and we'll fix it.” ‍",1,0

I was in charge of deploying marketing campaigns from ideation to execution. Mistakes were made and lessons were learned. After about a year, we decided to pivot the business in an attempt to save it — We made use of our connections in the alcohol industry and turned NOX into an e-commerce platform (NOX Express) focusing on alcoholic beverages. We even managed to turn the company around and at its peak made over S$250,000 in yearly revenue. ",0,0

When my 27th birthday hit, and my 30’s began quickly approaching, the lack of success and fulfillment in my career created an overwhelming sense of desperation. This was when I spent 10 months of my life on a Kickstarter project that would never launch.  While I’ll get to the details later, the pitch was this — an ultra-compact 72-hour disaster survival kit.

165," For those that don't know me, my name is Ron and I can be found over at OneHourProfessor. In terms of my background, prior to getting involved in this online business stuff, I spent about eight years in corporate America. Things were going well there, I had a six-figure job and a pretty good gig as a digital marketing manager, but I always felt a calling to be more entrepreneurial and the OneHourProfessor website was my first real introduction to this lifestyle. Originally, I intended on making the One Hour Professor website into a hub of online courses that I could then sell to my audience. At first, I was blogging on this website two to three times per week in an effort to gain an audience and I would say that I was mildly successful, but the courses never seemed to sell no matter what I tried. The original idea of the website, and why it got its name, was that I was going to make one-hour long courses that will cover a very specific concept related to digital marketing and help my audience. That isn’t at all how things turned out though. Although I still have the One Hour Professor website, that's just my home base to tell people about the number of different projects I have and what I learn as I go. At this point, my core business is that I run a portfolio of successful websites which I’ve created from scratch that generates hundreds of thousands of page views every single month. Here’s an image of my most successful website’s analytics from January: My portfolio consists of six different websites that all vary in their level of success. About 80% of my income comes from one website, but I'm working to diversify this even further with my other websites so that my income comes from more revenue streams.  As of now, I make right around $10,000 of revenue each month and of that, the profit is right around $8,500. Most of the expenses that I have are centered around writers and editors of my content, which allows me to focus on bigger picture things. At this point, I have a team of five people working for me and although they are just part-time contractors, without them my businesses wouldn't succeed. Here’s a quick snapshot of my Adsense earnings in January as that is the bulk of my earnings each month.  I think it’s important to note that my journey wasn’t easy and there were so many trials and difficulties since I’ve started. Because of this, one of the things that I've been very good about since the beginning was to make sure that I always publish a monthly income report.  It's been really cool to look back in the history of everything to see how far I've come. Here’s a snapshot of my last six months of income reports: I think that my main motivation for becoming an entrepreneur wasn't so much financial as it was controlling my own schedule.  Something about having to deal with traffic every day, sit in a cubicle, and answer to a boss just never sat well with me and although it took me awhile to make the transition, it ate me away on the inside every single day.  ",1,0

Our customers consist of startup founders, small business owners, bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers, and social media managers - basically any kind of business, or even people who are just building their personal brand. Here are a few examples of how some of our customers use OneUp: We have an e-commerce store owner that has a whole bunch of posts, each highlighting a different product he sells. He has them scheduled out to post one per day. However, once it gets through all the posts, those posts will automatically repeat. Before, he was taking the time to do all of this manually. Now, he has an automated way of consistently driving traffic back to his site and those products.We have a radio station that used to manually copy and paste the same social media posts about certain programs starting at various times of the day, every Monday through Friday. Now with OneUp, they just set those post to repeat, freeing hours of tedious labor every week. ",1,0

The concept of Phez was to reward content submitters in Bitcoin and had an emphasis on free speech. I was the sole creator of Phez, and honestly, this isn’t an utterly remarkable story where we blew through $17 million in VC funding and ended up crashing and burning or anything exciting like that. It’s just an honest take on what happened when a side project fails. The business model was going to be very similar to Reddit, with the exception that we would also reward the top contributors in Bitcoin payments. So, the idea was that we would eventually build a big enough audience to run ads, sell in-house ads, offer premium subscriptions (e.g. phez gold, etc.). ‍",0,0

181," Hey there, my name’s Logan. I’m 28 and I’m an engineer in San Francisco. My majors were in applied math and behavioral economics, beginning my career in finance in 2014 and transitioning into software engineering in 2015. I’ve successfully failed 3 companies so far, and I’m most passionate about making life happier and better for others. I’m currently one of the founding engineers at a small startup called Retain.ai, helping companies understand how they spend their time. If you are a designer or full-stack or frontend engineer looking for a fun startup environment with no politics and tons of learning and mentorship, email me at logan@retain.ai! As far as side projects go, I’m currently working on a mobile trivia game app for the TV show Friends called Bamboozled, which is in development. I’m hoping to deploy to the App Store and Play Store by the end of 2019. My most recent entrepreneurial pursuit was being CEO and CTO of Playdate for 2 years. I alone grew our user base to 300+ users and social media accounts to over 300+ hundred followers over a month, before growing the team to 7 at its peak and about 5k MAU (monthly active users). Playdate was an on-demand social networking app. Our users could pick an activity and at a tap of a button be instantly matched with another person. The idea was that we could use science to minimize “time to meeting” for people looking for short term or long term friendship. The app was free with no premium features or ads, and we aimed to make money by offering coupons from nearby venues that were only revealed upon physically meeting for a playdate. ‍",0,0
182," My name is Arkadiy Baltser. I’m 23 and based in the USA.  My startup journey started pretty early. I’ve been building in the remote collaboration space for the past six years, starting with MyWebRoom, then moving onto Newshunch, and I’m currently the Founder and CEO of Plutoview. Plutoview is revolutionizing remote collaboration by virtualizing applications and moving them to the cloud. By virtualizing them, there’s potential for an unlimited number of people to collaborate in those applications.  With Plutoview, we’re envisioning a world where everyone has equal access to the tools they need to achieve success in their lives and careers. Making that vision a reality will entail users moving applications from their devices to the cloud. We believe that this is the first step to bridging the digital divide.   I worked as a product developer on MyWebRoom, an Internet personalization startup that included VR Rooms. I also worked on Newshunch, a news gamification platform. We were working on gamifying some of the interactions and user experiences in the news media space. I was a Philosophy of Science Major at Boston University. I’ve always been intrigued by big questions, especially those that have to do with the progress of humanity.  During my senior year, I decided to leave Boston University to work full-time on Plutoview. My older brother was a massive inspiration for me. He founded MyWebRoom and then went on to found the renowned startup Grabr.io. I gained loads of experience watching my brother navigate his startup journey. I learned what goes into building a successful startup and was enamored by developing something from scratch that was all my own.",1,0
183," Hi, my name is Shirley Tan and I’m based in San Francisco, CA. I believe that I invented a product that is going to improve people lives in the workplace. The device I created is called Posture Keeper (PK). ‍ Explain Posture Keeper at a high level. What is it? PK is a lumbar support system that doubles as a posture corrector/trainer.  The big problem I am trying to solve is to help prevent people from leaning forward into their computer screen, as well as make them aware when they slouch so they can self-correct right away.  ‍ What's your title? What's your job duties right now in at Posture Keeper? I am the inventor, but also the founder of my new company. It's a small startup. It's just me and my cousin, and help from 3rd party contractors and consultants, mostly friends in the business.  Between me and my cousin, we do everything. Everything has my fingerprint on it. ‍ What's your business model? We’re launching the product on Kickstarter to start out with. Once we fulfill our campaign promise, we intend to sell the product in our Shopify Store, as well as on Amazon. Currently, our model is direct to consumer, by which we can get direct feedback from the Posture Keeper community to help understand what is important to them and what we can do to continuously improve, not just the product, but also the customer experience.  ‍",1,1
184," Hey, I’m Misha! I’m 48 and I’m living in Belgrade, Serbia, where I’m married with 2 kids. 23 years ago, I started my first website. 15 years ago, I founded WEBCentric, as a roof company for many of the projects I was involved in. 9 years ago, I founded Price2Spy, an online price monitoring service (SaaS), that’s currently employing 104 FTEs. In essence, I’m the company’s CEO, but I often also act as a product owner, business analyst (all due to my technical background) and coordinator of our major sales efforts. Price2Spy is currently serving over 650 clients who use it either to monitor their competitor prices (retail) or their retailers’ prices (manufacturers).

I come from a background of building several bootstrapped businesses and I become more known for building productized services or taking client service businesses and turning them into productized businesses where teams just have to execute a package of services very efficiently, following defined processes that continue to work as the company scales. That's sort of what led to ProcessKit. The other thing I run today is a productized service company called AudienceOps. We're a team of 25 people, as of today, where we do a done-for-you blog content service. We basically power the blogs of many other software and service companies. The business largely runs without me, nowadays, as I've got people running sales, the client service, etc, so that I can spend my whole time (and part of profits) building and rolling out ProcessKit. I come originally from a background as a designer and front-end web developer, doing a lot of work with WordPress. However, in recent years, I learned more about building the back-end side of things, becoming sort of a full-stack product designer. But I do come from a background more on the design side of things.

Previously, I worked on Profitabilly, a job cost tracking software. It’s a tool to track transactions in your projects so users can know how much and where are they expensing and profiting. It is similar to project management softwares, but instead of monitoring tasks, Profitabilly tracks your costs.  I ran Profitabilly as a single operation, and I didn’t have a co-founder or any employees. It was generating about $290/month when I shut it down, after six months. Profitabilly was a typical SaaS company, operating via monthly payments from customers. It was targeting services-based businesses, like agencies, construction companies, and consultants. ‍",0,0

A disgruntled buyer even taught me about customer support by telling on me to my parents when his shipment was delayed. I fell in love with web design when I was in high school and have spent the past 10 years working full-time jobs while building projects on the side. I’ve always dreamed of working for myself so when I left my last job in December I decided to take some time off to try and launch a couple product ideas I had. I launched the first version of Pull Reminders in January and have been bootstrapping it for the past several months. Pull Reminders helps development teams stay on top of pull requests and improve their code review process. You can set up reminders in Slack channels and have everyone receive direct messages about their assigned code reviews. Pull Reminders also provides metrics like pull request size, code review turnaround time, and the number of reviews completed — these help you recognize contributors and improve your team’s processes. Pull Reminders is used by over 400 companies like Pivotal, Instacart, WeWork, and Trivago. ‍",1,0

At Puppet Pelts, we manufacture and sell hand dyed fabric used for puppet skins to professional puppet builders around the world.  Our Pelts are made from a textile that is really only used for puppets. It is a wonderfully stretchy nylon fleece fabric that is milled in the United States. We buy the fabric in white and dye it a bunch of colors to sell to our customers. I was building puppets for fun. I discovered that the fabric you could buy online was only available in white, forcing any puppet builder to have to dye it on their own to change the color. Dyeing the fabric is really difficult in small spaces like apartments where I was living at the time. So, once I got a studio space, I offered dyeing services catered to puppet builders.  ",1,1
189," I’m currently an emeritus professor here at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont. After a long career as an academic trauma surgeon, I spent a decade as a research epidemiologist. But for the last 5 years, I’ve been engaged in trying to understand the cause of low back pain to solve this nearly universal complaint. Oddly, this required that I create a startup to build and sell an entirely new kind of chair. So, unexpectedly at the age of 71, I find myself running a company, QOR360.com. It’s clear that people are going to continue to sit, and sit a lot, no matter how often they are told that “sitting is the new smoking”. So, to deal with the public health crisis caused by sitting in badly designed “ergonomic” office chairs we had to be able to offer folks an entirely different way to sit, one that would allow them to move while sitting. Although there were a few such “active” chairs on the market, they were poorly designed, or too expensive to be a real solution. So, to change the way people sit, I became a reluctant entrepreneur and the CEO of a startup. Our business model is simply to help people sit better by introducing the idea of sitting actively to as wide an audience as possible. This required that we create a solid chair that could be sold at a price everyone could afford and yet was not so ugly that no one would want one.   ",1,0

Exactly one month ago, I launched my newest service called the Rankd SEO backlink database.  Rankd SEO is a unique approach to link-building. I don’t sell links and I don’t offer link-building services. What I do is that I offer step-by-step guides with images on how to create backlinks on hundreds of high-authority websites.  I’ve always liked the idea of a recurring revenue model and that’s why I made Rankd SEO in such a way. You must subscribe to our website to be able to access the database.  Even with our backlink guides, it would take days of non-stop work to build all backlinks in our database. And that’s only if you got one website. That’s why I think the model fits this website. I’m working on regularly expanding the database in order to have it so large that it wouldn’t be possible to build the links in a month. ‍",1,0

It was self-funded and I worked alone on the project. I was 20 years old at the time and thought I knew everything. I had such a vision for it. The software would allow you to cycle your calories, plan macronutrients, workouts, and also give access to your coach. At the time, the market was full of tools that were doing this, but they were all quite awful, and I was going after a specific niche.  We would make money by charging for the service and off of affiliate revenue.

215," Hi there, I’m Nick Sawinyh, one of the two founders of Seomator. I started my career as a network administrator in a local ISP company, where I met my business partner Eugene. Honestly, we just had three drinks together and found out we both were snowboarders and crazy chillers :) Then, we both worked for several years in the field of engineering and web products. Since we were very young, smart, and active, we started a couple of online businesses at the same time, which were successfully sold. Alongside this, we came up with an idea to serve the brand-new online service and worked on that for one and a half years until beta Seomator was launched. Whether you’re a freelance marketer or a marketing agency, Seomator will do the job for you and make your life easier. Right now we make about $4k MRR, and we are slowly growing.

219," My name is Hunt Burdick and I live in El Paso, Texas. My first introduction to programming was at the age of 12 with the Visual Basic language on DOS. My dad was building a piece of software for his business and showed me a few things along the way. Throughout the years I experimented and tinkered, never taking myself too seriously until one day it clicked I could do this for money! This led to a profitable software engineering career that eventually landed me at a Silicon Valley company called Arista Networks. Ever since those first days of watching my dad program a system for his business I’ve had a dream of building a comprehensive business management solution. Even though I had a great job, I wanted to start a business around this idea. During my last few months at Arista, I started working on my new company after hours. I called it Singulution and we were going to build a full-duplex real-time point of sale and business management solution for multi-location vendors. ‍",0,0

This new project is me bouncing back from a disaster. It’s been moving fast because I’m using lessons learned from my previous business, Sisu Academy. While it has the same heart - I still work to support marginalized entrepreneurs to grow, execute, build systems, and scale through the SaaS solution I am building - the way in which I am approaching it is completely different. Mostly thanks to my lessons learned through failure.  Sisu Academy was a tuition-free non profit boarding school for at-risk youth in San Diego. Our students were not fitting in well at the normal school environments and typically had trouble at home or at school. Our business model initially was based on donations from both large and small donors. We were working toward sustainability by building in revenue streams, mainly through an on campus incubator. We closed down operations before we could see that phase through.  ‍",0,1

In 2019, I went over to my manicurist, who also happened to be one of my closest friends. There, I saw some glaring issues she was experiencing, that could be easily fixed with a simple app. Customers were always late (a scheduling issue) and she was paying a high rent because that salon owner couldn’t optimize their space (a successful business model for that already existed: Airbnb). I took the glaring market issues and put them into three main buckets - stylist, salon owner, and customer. Sofetch was an all in one platform, connecting customers, technicians, and space providers with the sole aim of becoming the most convenient and cost-effective way of hosting, providing, and receiving beauty services. Me, my sister and my best friend were co-founders. I was the CEO. We had an all-girls team!  Our business model was a flat transaction fee rate when customers booked stylists. This was our competitive advantage, as other apps would charge %, which would result in high commission rates. For stylists to book space providers, there was a payment tier depending on the type of space, location, and rented time.  ‍",0,1

If you’re not familiar with DFS, you basically pick a new team each week, for each league you want to participate in. Most leagues would cover 1 week of fixtures (Friday-Monday, or Tues/Wed for the Champions League), but a few would just be the 3 pm games on a Saturday, or we’d have Sunday only if there were enough fixtures on. Your points get added up when players score goals, claim assists, make successful crosses, passes, tackles etc.  The site was monetized by charging an entry fee to a league (e.g. You pay £5 per team you want to select and enter into leagues), we then took 15% of the entry fees, and the rest is paid out as winnings. My role at Sport Draftr was marketing.

It was initially focused on Philadelphia, but as things evolved, particularly during 2020, we have grown far beyond just Philadelphia. Our community is mostly formed by independents, freelancers, solo entrepreneurs, and a growing population of remote workers. Indy Hall’s main focus is on helping people meet other people they have things in common with.

232," Hey! I’m Mike Doehla. I grew up in Newburgh, New York, and went to school for business. 4 years ago, at 33, I founded Stronger U, a nutrition coaching company of which I’m currently the CEO. Prior to this, I worked in banking for many years and then I transitioned to human resources. I wasn't very happy in that world I wanted to do something more creative. I didn't necessarily see myself as an entrepreneur, but I wanted to work in the fitness industry in some way. That’s how I converted my garage into a gym and began training people. But in the early days, I didn't have a clue about what I was doing. My website was terrible. My gym was cold. Nobody really cared much about it except me. I did that for 13 months working a few hours a night. Then I went completely online and stopped training people to focus on helping them with nutrition (coaching). I then became full-time and hired three other coaches to help me. I decided to make that transition because the training thing was not working it was more of a hobby. In order to grow and to quit my full-time job, I would have had to quadruple the number of people I was training. That’s when I figured if I focused on something I was better at and more passionate about, I could make the transition. In the beginning, the business model was a subscription with a minimum of 12 weeks, though we also sold 6 and 12 months. Today’s model is still a subscription though pricing has changed a little bit from the early days. ‍",1,0

I’m currently co-founder of Upscope (a screen sharing software).  I started Tailor a couple of years ago because I wanted a simple solution to A/B test and optimize websites. It allowed you to define different versions of a page and show the most relevant to a user based on various attributes.  At that time, this sounded like an amazing idea to me, but the truth is that I hadn’t done any previous research. On the typical A/B testing platform, you have to start a test, create some variants, test each on them on your site, evaluate the results and implement the winning variant. I simply wanted to test a variant on 10% of the traffic and then show the winning variant to other 90% of the traffic. So basically people would be able to skip all the evaluation process. Also, I was planning to create some statistical analysis to find patterns on the experiments, but I didn’t have any sort of Statistics expertise apart from High School AP Stats. So this kind of worked, but only for large websites. If you had a small website, it was really unlikely to see any major difference in terms of conversion. The business model was a simple SaaS, based on the traffic of the websites. There was a free plan for websites with under a certain traffic per month, and then, prices varied from $29 to $99. ‍",0,0

It’s my passion to do so, and have been shipping things since I was 10. I’ve shipped a variety of things, but my biggest products so far have been Taleship and Makerlog. Taleship was a social writing application that encouraged people to take the time to write every day, writing stories with friends. It initially began as a small side project, and when selected to attend the Microsoft Imagine Cup world finals, evolved into a full-fledged startup. Although it never reached this stage, it was planned to reach sustainability by offering an education SaaS, as this industry was showing much interest in the project. This never materialized. My current project is Makerlog, a dead-simple task log that helps you stay productive and ship projects faster. It works by allowing you to build in public, and receive positive reinforcement from others. It really keeps you productive! It recently launched on Product Hunt, where it met great success (#4 Product of The Day, peak #3). People really enjoy the project, and I enjoy making it, so it’s a win-win. I also learned quite a bit from my past product, so applying those lessons learned to a new one has been an interesting experience. ‍",0,0

I remember setting up my “booth” I made from a couple of cardboard boxes and standing next to a few dozens of elders who were selling handmade socks, old electronics, and some other scrap. Business was going well, but because it was still USSR with communism values, when somebody told my class teacher about my enterprise, I was publicly shamed in front of the whole class and forced to shut it down. I still remember that day as if it was yesterday, and I couldn’t understand what I had done wrong. Thankfully, my parents supported me. Since then I’ve had many attempts to earn money myself. On the professional side, I learned computer science and business management in university, web-design started as a hobby and turned into a side hustle, when I was designing and hand-coding websites for friends of the friends and small businesses.

251," I’m a hard-core sales professional and, although I have never worked in the food & beverage sector, I was able to utilize my skills from healthcare in building a new F&B brand.  At the back of my mind was the assumption that if the fundamentals were correct, then the industry didn’t make a difference. The main idea came into place mainly because my wife is a fantastic cooker, and she was constantly receiving numerous feedbacks from family and friends who had tasted her cooking, telling her she should try to commercialize her passion. We started brainstorming a few ideas. But we could easily identify a gap in the regular homemade food market, which most of the migrants living in our city (Gurgaon) were missing the most. It is perhaps impertinent to inform you that North Indians usually consume homemade meals including bread, lentils, vegetables, chicken, and meat. So, after a few weeks, we started The Punjab Kitchen. As the name says, we were specializing in the cuisine from the state of Punjab, which the majority of the people in Delhi NCR are familiar with. The business model initially was B2C with the intention of pitching to corporates (B2B) in the later stage. We wanted to cater to direct consumers who wanted to buy homemade measl, so our tagline was: “homemade food that fits your lifestyle”. ‍",0,0

258," Tzelon: Hey, I’m Tzelon, a 30-years-old, frontend developer and maker from Israel. Though at the moment I’m doing research on the question “How to launch a product as a Maker?” I’m learning about the process one should go through before launching a product. From building an audience to what to do after the launch. With that knowledge, I’m creating a tool for Makers, to guide them through the process. You can check it out at CreateCamp.co.   Ron: Hi, I’m Ron, 30-year-old software developer, studied computer science at the IDC Israel, an addicted podcast listener and an amateur poker player. Tzelon and I are friends since we were 6-year-old, we share the same passion for creating our own things, over the years we have started many projects and abandoned them soon after. We always waited for the “right time” to take a leap of faith and work on something full time, until Twitch Highlights. ‍ What was Twitch Highlights? Twitch.tv is a live streaming platform focused on video game live streaming, the streams are interactive as the streamer talk to the viewers and they can chat with him. The average length of a stream is ~8 Hours. That's very long… most of the viewers don’t watch the entire stream. But what if the most interesting\entertaining part of the stream happens when you are not watching?  This is where Twitch Highlights kicks in, we analyzed the stream and created a short video with only the most interesting and entertaining parts of it. ‍",0,0

We launched in February 2019, and within a couple of months, we reached $1,000 MRR. Right now, fast forward to 2021, we’re at $20,000 MRR, and we’re growing with over $1,000s a month. Since I’m not a developer myself, I have outsourced almost all of the tasks regarding Upvoty.

262," Hey there! My name is Chris Schwartze and I’m a 25-year-old entrepreneur and music producer from Enschede, The Netherlands. Like many others, in my early days, the internet struck a chord with me. In 2009 I stumbled upon music production because of this video from Ryan Leslie. The ability to create music from nothing to something in your bedroom fuelled my creativity. I co-founded Urban Masterclass with my best friend and cousin Robin. Since 2011, Robin sells his beats online to singers and rappers on his website Robin Wesley Instrumentals. Earlier in 2017, when we conducted research on his email list, we found out that 400+ of his artists repeatedly struggled with songwriting, mixing and recording. We both thought there was an opportunity because we couldn't find anything online that solved these problems—without tying together all the pieces yourself. Instead of coaching artists one by one, we decided to pack all our knowledge and expertise into an online masterclass. Depending on the masterclass, we offer one-off payments and payment plans. Once a student enrolls, he or she can log in and access the masterclass. ‍",1,0

I’ve spent most of my life living in the United States on the West Coast in California, but I currently reside in Japan with my wife and kids. The bulk of my time is spent on consulting while I build out my info products on the side and explore various SaaS ideas. Currently, I sell two products that are closely related to my consulting - a SaaS swipe file and an e-commerce file. All of my products are focused on helping founders grow their sales and contain strategies to do so. I also started a paid community called Founder Circle that focuses on weekly self-accountability to get founders closer to their goals.  Vacation Bird was my very first attempt at a startup back in late 2011, early 2012.  The name Vacation Bird is a play on the word “Snowbird”. A snowbird is a person who migrates from cold weather to warmer weather typically during the winter months so they don’t have to deal with the cold and snow. The website was a marketplace for finding your vacation rental. Think VRBO or an early version of Airbnb (back before there was an Airbnb).  Our business model, or at least the plan, was to charge for listings once the website became viable and to charge a booking fee for people who book through our website. ‍",0,0

I now run a Search Marketing agency in Bolton called Tao Digital Marketing and a start-up called quotonga which helps generate leads and opportunities for businesses.  The significant failure was VO2 Sportswear which provided custom performance sports clothing, such as Triathlon kit, Cycling kit and running kit, to clubs and teams mostly in the UK, but throughout the world.  As well as being the founder of the brand, my role within the team was that of Managing Director and therefore covered the majority of areas.  The main areas of focus for me were in the sales and marketing side of the business. We would generate an inquiry through the website then design a completely bespoke kit range that was always very unique. The kit would then be manufactured to a very high standard in Lithuania (if you have never been, get there it’s a beautiful country).  All of this would be done through our website and enabled us to grow into countries that we didn’t even realize had big Triathlon scenes.  ‍",0,0

I was the CEO and founder of Copimaj, a digital eCommerce full-service agency, through which we launched several other projects and services for brands.

A few years later, I founded StoreBeez, a marketplace platform that led to a 3-months experience at the Birmingham Oxygen Accelerator – an intensive bootcamp for tech startups.

Upon returning from the UK, I went on and launched an email marketing platform called Lupsale at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2013 San Francisco conference.

While I’ve enjoyed my fair share of failures, the most notable is probably the one at Wedmap, a startup that aimed to digitize the wedding planning process. I’ve found it together with 2 other guys and we ran it for almost 3 years before deciding to pull the plug.  Whoever had to play a role in planning a wedding, knows that it is full of inefficiencies and it lures entrepreneurs in every market to come up with the solutions. Our thinking was simple - in the age of Airbnb, gig-economy, and sharing-economy, people are so used to finding and booking the services online, that it's only a matter of time until you can find and book ALL of the services needed for your wedding - completely online. Thus ultimately, we aimed to be an online marketplace for wedding locations and service providers, using a usual marketplace business model - taking a % of the booking amount. ",0,0

280," I’m Mike, 28 years old based in Atlanta GA. I was born and raised in Lagos Nigeria, moved to the US when I was 12 years old and I fell in love with the computer from an early age. I started simple coding in High school and that would later lead to my career now as a web developer/ internet entrepreneur. WURA started as a pet project, and for 2 years it really was that. My family and I loved to watch our native African/Nollywood movies and we generally had access to those movies on YouTube, except they were all over the place. You had to search and dig through the dirt to find a good quality movie. WURA was a way for me to curate a playlist of titles so to speak. It was an on-demand video platform we one came and built their own playlist of high-quality titles that were readily available. It wasn’t until I had some cash in the bank though that I started thinking about the project more like a business. My other businesses took off and I had the capital to turn it into a legitimate business. And that I did, hired a team of 10 with myself included. And we put together a nice platform to watch movies on your pc and mobile devices. For a monthly fee of $3.99, a user had access to hundreds of new titles (movies and TV shows) both in English and other local dialects. My main task was to oversee everything.

282," My name is Jon Lawrence, I’m 46 years old and live in the Seattle metro area. I like to say that I haven’t failed enough to quit, but haven’t succeeded enough to make it worth my while, but that’s only half true.  The part that is true, is that I haven’t failed enough to quit, and that’s saying something. The part that isn’t true is that it hasn’t been worth my while.  It is fair to say I’ve never managed to get to a cushy exit from a venture, despite having a $20m term sheet on the table once. But along the way I’ve managed to learn enough from my mistakes that I found my way to leading teams whose work is challenging, sometimes inspiring, always teaching me new things and making a good living while I’m at it. Even better, I continue to learn and grow in ways that should I decide to take another swing at entrepreneurship, I’ll be sure to make new and original mistakes next time! I incorporated my first ‘business’ in 1995 while at college when I created a 501(c)(3) non-profit because some friends of mine and I felt like we could better serve ourselves and our interests in theater with some structure that would help us raise funds and pick productions that we wanted to make. No one really guided me through any of it, I’d just picked up a couple of books, and an “incorporate yourself” software kit that came on a set of 3.5” disks (!).  Little did I know it that would lead to incorporating almost a dozen entities involved in different types of businesses over the years to follow including production companies for media development and production, event production, underground wine storage (yes, really), and technology.  My first tech startup was in 2010 when a couple of friends and I figured that Twitch.tv was on to something, and we knew video production pretty well, so we tried to pair that with the nascent eSports movement. I raised close to $200k from friends and family, spent about 8 months building a beta product, got a few folks into the beta, and then depressingly ran out of runway (it was rather expensive to run hosted video streaming in the cloud 10 years ago). My second tech startup, a few years later in 2013, came on the heels of leading a fairly high-profile mobile game launch for an NBC show called “The Million Second Quiz.” As part of that project, I learned a lot of synchronous/real-time technologies that were really just emerging at a cost-benefit point that made them worth trying to use for media projects (open-source tech like Cassandra and RabbitMQ) and that lead me straight into Yottio.

I was always building useless products like Hardcore Prawn Lawn, a website that has no purpose, receives on average 230,000 unique visitors, and was eventually sold for thousands of dollars.
