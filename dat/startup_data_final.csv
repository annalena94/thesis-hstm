0,101-studios," Hi, I’m Matt “GundayMonday” Sever. I’m a data science professional in their early 30s out of Detroit, MI. First entered the data science field from a grad school DARPA grant to successfully predict when soldiers were going to get sick with the flu before they started sneezing. Fell into the fintech space working for Quicken Loans on everything from speech analytics to nationwide automated marketing engines. And have dabbled in video game-related startups for the past decade. Most famous is Instaburst (200+ virtual team that made League of Fighters), but we’ll be talking about my first startup 101 Studios today! 101 Studios was an edutainment producer. That’s a cringe-worthy word for “video games that teach you things while you play them”. Our flagship (and only game) was called Antibody. You played as a soldier for hire who would shrink down to microscopic size and fight germs inside of sick patients. We made a pokemon clone to do this where the random monsters you’d fight were actual bacteria, viruses, and fungi. You’d use real treatments to take them down. Each random encounter was a flashcard, each type of attack a different answer you could potentially give on a med school exam. Thought was to gamify what med students usually brute force memorized to make it easier to remember! The business model was to develop the game(s) and then sell access to play with a monthly subscription fee. "," Every professor we talked to liked the idea, but wanted something hyper customized for their specific class. This was hard to build and plan for. Many of them like the concept, but not for their class (probably a polite “no”). This was the start of the end. We built a product that was difficult to scale, and hard to customize for the specific needs of our consumers. People liked the concept of “a video game that is fun to play and will help you ace the big exam” but it was very hard to build that in a scalable way that actually delivered. Huge time sink to build something people were at best lukewarm to using. --- How did you realize you were going to fail? We started talking to users and potential customers. We kept getting feedback along the lines of, “Wow what a great idea! But I would not use this unless it had X, Y, and Z!” Was tough to get the product to a point where it satisfied the different needs and wants of everyone. It definitely would have been smarter to listen to significant amounts of user feedback first before building something complicated. --- What did finally provoke the shutdown of 101 studios? After it became apparent that no one wanted to buy the things we were building (failed sales pitch after sales pitch), we pivoted to my cofounder’s idea to build a League of Legends inspired fighting game called League of Fighters. We could leverage a lot of the work and network we had built for 101 Studios, so felt like a good pivot. That one failed for completely different reasons but was dramatically more successful! Didn’t feel like we ever shut down 101 Studios, it just changed into something better with superior consumer targeting. It was fun and exciting to work on something a large number of people wanted! ",,,,," We started super lean. Our first “game” was four screens, with two fightable enemies. We worked with a friend of the family (Paul Slusser who worked on AAA games like Orcs Must Die) to make some rad art assets for us, and pieced together a prototype level. My co-founder, Dave, ended up building his own game engine from scratch to run it. I produced all of the music/SFX and worked with Paul to get the art assets ready. After a few months, we had a demo level where you shrunk down to fight foot fungus under a toenail. Our demo took ~15mins to play through. --- Did you run into any obstacles in this process? What did you do to overcome them? And how did you approach the pricing strategy? The demo only worked on PC, had a ton of bugs, and took WAY too much time to produce. We were able to show the concept, but also found that producing a larger game was going to be significantly more work than we anticipated. This was the main issue that killed the project. --- Did you enjoy the process of getting started / building it? Did you launch/publicize it in any way? If so, how did that go? Yeah! This was a ton of fun to figure out and build from scratch. Sad it didn’t turn into anything, but the concept of video game random encounters as more engaging flashcards worked when we tested it, so might return to it in the future when I’m bored on a rainy day using a newer tool like RPGmaker to simplify a lot of the pain points we had. ",," During college, I thought I wanted to be a doctor. But oh man, the pre-med weeder classes were horribly boring and structured in a way where it wasn’t easy to study or learn. I noticed that my fellow classmates felt the same pain, and started looking for a better way. Inspiration hit when my roommates were talking about how they could remember every pokemon from 10 years ago, but couldn’t remember what they studied yesterday. That was the big ‘Aha!’ moment. Growing up I was always a gamer. My family would play hours of Dr. Mario (trash-talking the entire time) every week, and I always had the newest Nintendo game to dump hours into after sports practice. I continued playing games during college and made friends with some kindred spirits. My freshman roommate and co-founder was the best Meta Knight player in NA, so I was constantly surrounded by hardcore gamers and the new hot games. This kind of environment made it easy to tie game mechanics to a better way to learn. The University of Michigan (Go Blue!) has an amazing library. Every book you could ever want. I started devouring everything about games and learning and found that every book I tried to check out was on the syllabus for this EDU 222 class called “Games and Learning” led by Barry Fishman. Ended up enrolling in this class alongside my graduate work (studying Hospital and Molecular Epidemiology). The knowledge gained here helped us build the foundation for a working product and learn exactly why I remember everything about the Pokemon game from my middle school years. During college, I thought I wanted to own and operate my own music venue (being a doctor was my back up plan). To vet the field, I formed, led, and wrote music for a ska band called “Gunday Monday”, named after a joke about arm day at the gym. Ska was perfect music for understanding the music industry. Enough people liked it around Ann Arbor that you could get shows at every venue, but not enough liked it enough to form bands to compete with you for those shows. I ended up opening for every one of my favorite acts and getting to see them for free. I also saw how different types and scales of music venues worked from the inside. This taught me enough to know that I did not want to own my own music venue, although it was a lot of fun. That ska band taught me all about music production which generated all the sound effects and music assets for our game with 101 studios. Still have a few on Bandcamp here if you want a taste. I also learned a ton about management. Trying to get a team of 8 musicians to show up on time, let alone play music somewhat passably, was another good challenge that grew some serious new leadership muscles. This gave me the foundation I needed to build out the art assets while my co-founder coded up the actual game engine. ", Build the easiest MVP possible and get user feedback early. Keep talking to users as you grow the product. This would have saved us MONTHS of time and allowed for an earlier pivot to something that would actually work! ," Our thought was to go B2P (Business to Professor). If we could get classes to use our tool, then we’d have new customers buying our game every semester. Thought was to partner and grow our relationships with professors and help build customized games for their classes. In practice, it was tough to get anyone interested and even tougher to customize class by class. --- How did you employ/approach these tactics? Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous? This whole endeavor taught me that you should talk to as many potential users as possible during the building process. It would have saved younger me a lot of time and headache knowing that the monetization funnel was going to fail before spending time building out assets and a custom game engine from scratch. Getting warm intros makes these users/potential sales meetings easier to get on friendlier terms. You get better feedback too. Leverage your immediate social network to help you out and learn as fast as possible!", I’m pretty active on Twitter. Currently working on an automated video game coach called TryHarder.," The Lean Startup by Eric Ries - Fantastic book about the lean mindset that changed how i think about things.The Art of Game Design by Jesse Schell - Teaches you how to think from different perspectives as you build a product.Startup School - Tons of resources from industry professionals teaching everything from product design to marketing. It’s a great way to connect with people solving the same problems. Also, a chance to get funding if your idea’s interesting enough. "," Mostly time was lost here. Spent a good 3 months building out the product and another 3 months of networking before networking with potential users. $800 worth of art assets, but the rest we built ourselves. Not too bad, but we could have learned to build a different product if we flipped the order and talked with users first.

1,10er," Hi! I am currently working at Elastic making sure our APM solution is as good as possible for people with Ruby apps. Elastic is a great company and a lovely place to work (and we’re hiring!). On the side, I’ve built and run a few side projects. Creating things is a very meditative thing for my brain, so I have to make a conscious effort to keep the number of projects down. The most successful of the side projects have been 10er.co, a Patreon-ish service for (mostly) Danish creators. 10er is the perfect side project: It solved one of my own problems, it’s making a nice bit of recurring revenue and it takes very little work to maintain. Like many others in our industry, I’m self-taught. I started a university education some 10 years ago but dropped out to try my luck at stand-up comedy. Did that full-time for a few years with the occasional programming contract on the side. Then, at some point it became tiresome to keep fighting to get by from comedy when I loved programming just as much and programming is way easier to make a living from. ‍",," Finding time is the biggest obstacle in expanding 10er and the other side projects I have. With a full-time job and 2 kids (son 4 years, daughter 10 months 🤯) free time can be hard to come by. This reality has forced me to make 10er as autonomous and small as possible. I still don’t have a custom admin interface and still do some things manually in the terminal. Project sign ups still go through me personally for instance. It’s almost like forced non-growth. I tell myself that this is both a curse and a blessing. I’ve personally connected with and spoken to every project using the service and have never had any problems with abuse or the like.  I’ve made lots! Handling people’s money and credit cards make everything a lot more serious so mistakes feel like your entire world is breaking up. I’ve had made a few stomach-turning mistakes: The first time I ran the charge script, it wasn’t idempotent. That is, when a charge failed (for some reason. They do a lot, I know now) the entire script would start from the beginning charging everyone again. When I realized what it was doing, it felt like sweat sprung from my entire body like one of those garden sprinklers. The fix was to make the script look for existing charges before charging. That way it never charges twice for the same donation. At one point I consolidated two kinds of user accounts (project owners and donators. It was very confusing) I jumbled almost everyone’s subscriptions. When I ran the charge script a few weeks later, people were charged for other people’s subscriptions. I almost felt the earth shake when I realized. Rebuilding everyone’s subscriptions ended up taking a few weeks and I was very embarrassed. Still, both times only a few people didn’t accept my apology. I think I had 2 or 3 users leave from those accidents. Everybody else was very forgiving and appreciated my swift response and openness. Always be humble and honest. ‍",,," My biggest disadvantage is being alone. When I don’t have the time or motivation to work on 10er things stand completely still. I always do support of course but development grinds to a halt in periods. I’ve recently found a freelance junior coder to help me on the lower-risk tasks. She has already made a few pull requests that are in production. I suffer from having an opinion on most things and therefore want to do most things myself. Outsourcing marketing or support or that sort of thing has always seemed like a risk to me. Wanting to do everything myself is definitely a disadvantage. But it’s still manageable, at least for now. ‍"," I built 10er as a Ruby on Rails app. Ruby and Rails are amazing things. I strongly believe that if I’d built it in anything else it might’ve never been done. I think it took about a month of work on the side and consisted of as little as possible. A signup form with a credit card and email fields, an account page listing subscription and a script to charge people once a month for the previous month’s released episodes. Doing as little as possible was on purpose. Podcast audiences (at least ours) are a very loyal and engaged lot and I think it helped a lot that they knew the service was built by me for us. So when my charge script went rogue on the very first run and charged some people multiple times when it should’ve just charged once, people were barely anything but amused that I’d made such a stupid mistake. I’ve found this to be the case every time I’ve messed up (lost count!): Respond quickly and honestly. Don’t get defensive or shovel it under the rug. Most people will forgive you if they can sense that you are genuinely trying to do good. ‍",," Doing stand-up comedy was what led me to create 10er. 7 years ago, I asked my friend and fellow comedian if he wanted to do a podcast with me. Few people listened to podcasts back then, let alone knew what they were. Since then we’ve recorded 262 episodes and have recently ended the project. Along the way, we took donations from our listeners. One-time donations were fine – we were of course stoked that anyone would give us money for something they already got for free. But one-time donations were hard to plan anything around. And we didn’t want to keep pleading for donations. Then Patreon popped up and the model seemed like the perfect solution. Instead of sitting around waiting for donations, the donators subscribed to donate, giving an amount they decided themselves per episode we released. I never created a Patreon account for us though. Everytime I began I never finished signing up. The whole thing just seemed like a hassle. Too many input fields and things to consider and graphics to provide. Patreon expects creators to create more content for patrons. We felt we were already giving away lots with our already free content. So, being a programmer (and perhaps naive), building my own service as a side project seemed like the easier solution. I’d recently made another side project using Stripe for the first time (Motherload.dk – a webshop selling Danish comedy shows as digital downloads) and the experience of using Stripe was such a joy that I kind of felt like I could build anything. I still feel like that. What a wonderful service and company. Highly recommended! I built 10er only for my own podcast but in such a way  that if somebody came along and wanted to use it for their own project then it wouldn’t take too much of an effort. The first month 10er charged money was December 2014 and about half a year later the first other project joined."," I’m not sure I could’ve done things differently. That’s not really how I think. I’ve been lucky along the way. I’d of course have avoided some mistakes but what are mistakes but really intensive learning. I’m lucky to have a pretty forgiving conscience. That means I’ve always been late on school papers or deadlines. But it has also allowed me to forget my failures or at least laugh at them pretty quickly. That’s one of the things you learn doing stand-up comedy. Everybody experiences bombing and when you do, you’ve never felt as terrible before. But then you get over it. Repeat until you have no fear of looking dumb left. I recommend everyone try sucking at stand-up at least once! I’m often telling my current self that I should try and work some more on 10er instead of spreading the few spare hours I have on multiple projects. Maybe I should start listening more to him. ‍"," As 10er was launched through and for my own podcast I already had a platform and target audience. Since then I’ve taken in other projects (136+ as of writing this). As my biggest obstacle is finding the time to work on 10er, I’ve kept my marketing efforts to only target projects, letting the projects themselves attract donors. I’ve tried some content marketing-ish blogging. Even hired a friend to interview projects, but in the end I think most (if not all) projects found 10er through some other project using the service. Podcasters usually listen to a lot of podcasts themselves. Lucky for me. I’ve recently opened up a lot more about the project, sharing my income and expenses on the site and saw a nice bit of interest from that. At this point, it seems to me that my most impactful way of marketing will be sharing as much as possible. Creative people are attracted to other people’s experiences and creative people are my target audience. ‍"," For more on 10er, go to 10er.co. To see the numbers, there’s 10er.co/open (inspired heavily by @levels’ nomadlist.com/open) I have a portfolio-ish website at brnbw.com and a personal website here.

I like helping out so if you think I can help you with any technical, career or product questions don’t hesitate to ask ✌️ Thanks for reading all of this and thank you Rich for the opportunity."," I’d suggest trying a lot of ideas. Doesn’t matter if it’s been done before. Even better if it’s obvious how you can earn money on the idea. Stripe is so, so good. Use their platform(s). Rails is so, so good. Use it. Or just use the thing that you know already. Don’t listen to all the “X doesn’t scale” or “real developers use X” bullshit. Use boring tech. Or exciting tech. In the end the language or framework hardly matter to you users. Keep being curious and experiment. Build things just because. Look up people who are successful in ways that speak to you. You don’t have to agree with everything they say but inspiration can come from anywhere. ‍",,Software & Hardware,,Denmark,"February 21, 2019",Mikkel Malmberg,https://www.failory.com/interview/10er,"['http://10er.co/open', 'https://twitter.com/levelsio', 'https://nomadlist.com/open', 'http://brnbw.com/', 'https://mikkelmalmberg.com/', 'https://twitter.com/mikker']",success,1,$0-$10k/mo,"Mikkel created 10er, a Patreon-similar service for Danish creators.

2,140-canvas,," So we got 17k people to the landing page from our YouTube promotions and we’d thought we’d hit the big time. Amazingly, only converted 20 or so converted to actual sales. So it doesn’t take a genius to work out that there was a problem with the landing page.  It wasn’t badly designed either but I just think the product was too complicated. If you on onto the landing page to try and purchase a tweet, you’ll see that you have to actually write the tweet yourself. There was no template’s you could buy.   From our analytics, we saw a lot of people click on the box but and never make purchases. I think the actual act of coming up with an original tweet was too much effort.  I confirmed my suspicions here when I saw Framed Tweets pop up. It’s a similar concept, but they allow you to just purchase default tweets. For example a funny Kanye West tweet. According to a Starter Story article they’re making> 300k / year. ‍",,,,," Well, funnily enough, I’d just done Learn Node by Wes Bos so I built the whole thing in Node and Pug which was the stack Wes used. This took me about one and a half months.  But unfortunately, that stack fell down at the final hurdle. I couldn’t get the text on the editable tweet to go blue when someone used a # or @ key. So I started from scratch. Did another Wes Bos course, React for Beginners course and built the whole thing in that which took me another month.  At the time I thought this made sense. And that the site had to be perfect. Wow, how wrong I was. Looking back now converting the whole site from Pug to React purely for this blue text effect was a really really awful idea. I just naively had it in my head that things had to be perfect.  At that time I didn’t have anyone there to say to me, “Oh, by the way, you definitely shouldn’t change the whole codebase over because of some inconsequential highlighting problem. Look at the bigger picture.”  And when it’s just yourself making decisions in a vacuum your mind can play tricks on you. I just wanted it to be perfect.  Whilst I was building the site my co-founder Giles was sorting out suppliers. I think he just called up about twenty printers in the UK and American and claimed he was starting some venture capital canvas company so he persuaded one or two to offer discounts.",," Hi, I’m Harry Dry, 23 years old. Well, I’d just left university. I “studied” Economics and to be honest though the whole thing was a complete waste of time. I had no interest in sitting in a suit and bullshitting about Macroeconomics for my next 50 years. So I started learning to code. Began with Code Academy, then I found the Net Ninja, Wes Bos, Level Up Tuts who taught me pretty much everything I know. I’ve always been a big believer in real-world experience. There’s “blog post knowledge” and then there’s “DIY” knowledge. One thing is watching a Wes Bos copying some code and another is getting out there in the real world and doing it yourself.  So that was the reason I started my first business. Real coding. Real experience. Real money. I just needed an idea...   Well, I’d got back from university, arrived back at my parent's house and there were these huge canvases hanging on my bedroom wall. My friend Giles bought them for me as a gift for finishing my degree.  On the canvases were tweets from Roger Federer and David Luiz. Originally it was pretty surreal, “What, has Roger Federer tweeted me!” I realized they were fake when I noticed that Jeremy Corbyn, Theresa May and Donald Trump had liked them. But I still, it was a really thoughtful gift.  I just got really excited by these canvases. So I thought this is it. I’m going to try and build a website which allows you to write up one of these custom tweets and purchase them as canvas prints online. "," I wouldn’t have done anything upfront. Instead, I’d have gone out into the market and checked there was actually demand. I spent two months designing and redesigning the website, Giles had spent time negotiating print discounts with suppliers in America and the UK, We had a nice logo, we printed stickers, we ticked every box, but none of that really mattered…  Because we never took the time to validate the product. And that’s why despite getting all that traffic we had nothing to show for it. There’s a cool story about Patrick McKenzie (@patio11) where he talks about going directly into hair salons, paying for appointments, just to talk to the hairdressers and try and figure out if there’s demand for a barbershop booking service. We basically should have done the equivalent of this. Perhaps, went back to our old school with a couple of demo canvases, talked to the kids, see if they understood the product, see if they were willing to pay £30 for it, whether they even used twitter, or understood the concept."," So about two months later I’d finished the website and we were ready to go. I posted in on Product Hunt and it got an initial burst of traffic. But slowly and surely the traffic was drying up and we realized we needed to do something a bit different.  Thankfully my co-founder Giles had come up with an idea. He said we should post our canvases to YouTubers around the world who do this thing called “Mail Time”. Now, “Mail Time” is a type of video where YouTubers open fan mail and show it off to the camera. So we thought, this could be a wild way to get our startup some exposure. We found ten YouTubers who did regular Mail Time videos, wrote ten funny tweets, printed them off as A1 Canvases, and shipped them to their PO boxes around the world. A couple of weeks passed and a YouTuber called Chilly did a MailTime video and opened our canvas on camera. She was so impressed by our gift that she gave a free shoutout to our website in the description and even pinned my comment. This video ended up getting 3.3 million views. Next up, this Youtuber called Sodapoppin does a MailTime and opens our canvas. That video got 400k views. In terms of why it worked, I think it was all the little details we went to.  Whilst most companies sending products included formal letters and sleek packaging we did the complete opposite. We bought glitter, fancy cards, bubblewrap, Christmas wrapping paper, and hand wrote personal letters.  This certainly bought us goodwill with the YouTubers who were more than up for shouting out our product. In total, we spent £250 spent, 2 out of 10 hit rate, 3.7 million views. and 17k Uniques our site. "," I’m currently working on Marketing Examples. A gallery of real world marketing examples for all the marketers out there.  There’s some great advice Naval Ravikant once gave: “Build the product only you can build.” And that was the driving force behind Marketing Examples. “What are my unique talents, what can I make that no-one else in the world can. Even if they tried. Even if they had money.” And this is what I came up with.  The Marketing Examples Twitter account is also worth checking out. I distill each example into a simple easy to digest thread. And I tweet a more freely about how to unprogram yourself on my personal twitter. Remember you can find 140 Canvas' landing page here."," In terms of communities, I feel I like the Indie Hackers. I also like another group called Work In Progress. ‍Pieter Levels has a very no bullshit attitude to startups which I like. I’m also inspired by the lifestyle of Vincent and Marie who are building Threader. They left Paris and just started traveling around doing their own thing at their own pace. They kinda said “fuck you” to what society said that they should be doing so that definitely fuels me.  I also think people could learn a lot from Tyson Fury and Kanye West. Not only are they both superb self-promoters but they’re also out there, two unshackled minds, playing in the sandpit, living their best life.  And I think we’d all benefit from a dose of that.  And as far as tools go, I use Sketch for Design and VSCode to code. Funnily enough, I’d say the most inspiring bootstrapper tales you can read is one I wrote myself haha!  It’s called The Kanye Story. It’s the story of how I went from lying in bed with zero ideas to negotiating with the biggest superstar on planet Earth!  Failory's Recommendation: Check out this talk from Harry on how to validate startup ideas, where he talks a little bit about 140 Canvas' story and what he did different in his next startup, The Kanye Story. "," The YouTube promotion must have cost about £250. That was pretty much our only cost. Well web and domain hosting might have been another £20.  We must have sold about 25 canvases in total. Profit on each canvas was about £5. So £270 - £125 = £145  So we probably lost about £145 in total. But I like to look at it like this. 2 months time and £145 loss is really not much for the lessons it taught me. Some people spend a couple of years and hundreds of thousands for the same lesson, This failure taught me all the fundamental lessons: Validating an idea, Ship earlyAudience before product Unless I can validate a project upfront, build the MVP in a month, and know how I’m going to get my first 100 users, I’m not going to start a new project now. ‍",e-Commerce,No Market Need,United Kingdom,"July 18, 2019",Harry Dry,https://www.failory.com/interview/140-canvas,"['https://marketingexamples.com', 'https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ', 'https://twitter.com/harrydry', 'https://cryptic-tundra-74488.herokuapp.com/']",failure,0,,"After dropping out of university, Harry went back home and found a gift: a fake big tweet from Federer.

3,40-aprons," My name is Cheryl Malik, and I’m a law school dropout, cupcake bakery deserter, burlesque troupe leaver-behind, and general quitter. My true background is in publishing: I worked as the editor-in-chief at the literary magazines at my high school and in college, and that was what I always, always wanted to do. You know, when I “grew up.” But I was told that industry was going away (And it kind of did), so I went to law school instead. Obviously. I knew almost instantly law school wasn’t for me, so, armed with a useful philosophy degree, I worked through strange potential career path after strange potential career path, working as an employee in music and audio sales, then starting a burlesque troupe, cupcake catering business, vintage clothing sales, vintage clothing TV producer, then settled in as a digital marketing and web design freelancer. The one constant the entire time was the food blog I’d started right before law school: 40 Aprons. I’d started the blog as a creative outlet as I entered a notoriously dry, uncreative, and challenging process, and it grew slowly along with my writing, marketing, and photography skills. In the last year, I discovered my true niche and voice, and in 12 months, my blog income grew nearly 4000%. My traffic increased 1300%, skyrocketing from 71,279 page views in January 2017 (The tipping point at which my blog’s traffic was already increasing, having found my niche and started giving it my all) to 1,059,834 page views in January 2018. That means my blog has grown my income double or triple what I was making at my last agency job, depending on the month. We’re working on a food blogging & photography coaching program to help other food bloggers find success. In addition to that, my long-time dream of starting a design and marketing agency focused on food bloggers, restaurants, and food brands has finally come to fruition: my agency Layer Cake is active and taking clients! Our passion is creating digital experiences that are worthy of the food they feature, and we’re anything but a churn-and-burn conveyor belt-style agency. We become a part of each client and take on the business as our own this, in conjunction with my experience in the food and food blogging world, is what makes us special. I’m also a mother to a toddler with one on the way, so there’s a lot of teetering and waddling going on in our studio right now. ‍",," The biggest challenge for me has always been, and still is, giving 40 Aprons my absolute focus. Because it’s enjoyable and has always been my passion, it always was pushed to the back burner for me. And today, client work and deadlines always come first, but I have to remind myself: all of this is a reality because of the blog. That should be my #1 focus always!  In terms of challenges within the industry, there is so much content now, and it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd. It took time for me to do this, and I’m still working on it! But given the sheer volume of food blogs these days, it’s challenging for almost everyone to separate themselves, develop a recognizable style, and drum up a loyal followership of people who really relate to what you’re doing and how you’re doing it. It wasn’t until I really narrowed down my niche, and then narrowed it further by analyzing the content that performed best with my audience, that I was able to feel successful on this spectrum. Now that I’m established in the niche and know very well what works and doesn’t work with my audience, I’m working hard to pump out the content that my readers want, whilst integrating a voice that resonates with them (Thankfully, that’s my regular voice, but I include my more family-oriented perspective these days) to continue to grow a presence. I want my site and content to be more than a random recipe found on Pinterest I want it to be a collective, a voice, more of a destination than a chance stop along the way. ‍  40 Aprons is so old, you can witness every mistake or total lack of skill or knowledge like layers of fossils. For a long time, my photography was absolutely atrocious, and in the beginning, it didn’t really matter! Today, food bloggers consistently produce magazine-quality photography, but a decade ago, cell phone shots were a-OK. That, of course, changed, and I tried to adapt to it.  And then, of course, there was the creative titling, naming things “So Nice They Named It Twice” rather than what the dish actually was. Again, back then, people weren’t searching on Pinterest for recipes (Because Pinterest didn’t exist!), and priority was always, always given to mega food sites, so on top of it being less visible, there were simply no real resources to learn best practices.  The biggest mistake, though, would have to be my tendency to keep 40 Aprons always idling in the driveway, burning fuel and resources but not really going anywhere. I saw quick growth after I gave it my all, but, to be fair, I spent many years learning the skills that allowed me to do so.",,," Not to sound too much like a cheesy interview, but I’m a bit too ambitious. I pursue too many ideas. I come up with ideas for new businesses or projects regularly and want to do them all! This, combined with my inability, or perhaps refusal, to say no to anything, can frequently lead to my being worked beyond my bandwidth. The reality is I have the opportunity to have a balanced life focused on family, experiences, and my passion. I apparently work very hard to sabotage that! Thankfully, within my niche, the things that might be considered disadvantages in other niches are irrelevant. Almost all of us have kids, for example, so we’re all starting from the same baseline, developing recipes with toddlers hanging off our legs, furiously editing at naptime. I’m grateful for the community in so many ways, but this is definitely one of them: we all share a perspective and a goal. While this could be viewed as a disadvantage, I find it incredibly inspirational and community-building. In that sense, too, it’s important to share that I don’t view my peers as competitors. The Internet is abundant in every sense, and I relate more to the (very loose, in this application) concept of the Blue Ocean Strategy here. In other words, a new recipe doesn’t detract from an existing recipe, it simply creates continually new space for consumers to explore.  That said, because my niche is very defined, it can feel very “whoever gets to it first” when it comes to products, especially cookbooks. As soon as one person writes a specific cookbook, like paleo Indian food or the paleo Air Fryer, it feels to me off-limits to cover, or at least less effective. How many of each cookbook do we really need? ‍"," 40 Aprons grew slowly my focus was not on my blog as a business for many years but was more of a hobby. After something like 7 or 8 years, teetering on the edge of total burnout from agency life, I realized that it was time to take all the energy and skill I was applying to my clients at work and give my blog my all. We moved into a new house, and I quit my job, half-jokingly worried that we’d quickly default on our mortgage. Instead, this new focus on my blog as a business paid off in spades, and my traffic, and, consequently, revenue grew rapidly. My business model is pretty simple: I make most of my income off of display ads shown to my visitors, so the more traffic I have, the more revenue I make, typically. It gets a bit more complicated than that with seasonal RPMs (revenue per mille - the money I make per thousand impressions of an ad), but that’s ultimately what it comes down to. I also freelance as a food photographer and digital marketer, sell products related to my blog, make affiliate income off of products I recommend, and work on sponsored posts with various companies. In December 2017, all of these elements added up to over $11,000 in income. January 2018’s income is closer to $18,000, thanks to seasonally high traffic and product sales. My ad revenue in January, despite year-long RPM lows, was over $13,000, a number I simply couldn’t have fathomed a year prior.  ",,," I would have learned food photography early! Not only is it just loads of fun, visually advertising your work has always been important. I wish I’d been confident early on that I could learn it and simply gone for it. ‍"," My number one and most important marketing strategy to grow my traffic is my focus on consistent, high-quality content. I pay very close attention to the content I produce that performs the best and prompts the greatest engagement, and I identify what links these recipes, what makes them similar. I boil those qualities down to their simplest and use those traits to inspire me for future posts. Aside from my focus on content, I make sure to learn best practices for each of the platforms used for promotion. We focus heavily on Pinterest, as well as high-quality lead magnets to consistently increase our list, and I try to be quite active on Instagram, always following what the platforms publish as the best practices. Facebook… I just can’t with Facebook. I do, however, run a couple related groups, one of which is growing quickly and is very active. I also make sure there’s a solid SEO foundation for every post I write, focusing on logical searching rather than exactly what SEMrush.com or Google’s keyword planner says. I use Pinterest’s search population frequently for realistic searching and find that works very well for me."," Check out my blog, 40Aprons! I promise my recipes are pretty great.

4,abby," Hi! I’m a data scientist for four years now, and I’m currently working at AdTriba, a marketing attribution tool. I’m somewhere between a data scientist and a programmer, so I’m constantly trying to combine both skills and create something useful. Unfortunately, no project has come to fruition yet. My biggest side project so far was ABBY, a documentation and evaluation service for A/B tests.  "," I think the main problem was that most people didn’t realize the potential a documentation service for A/B tests has. To make such a service successful, I would have needed to educate the users, and that’s not something you can do before you offer any value to them. A service must provide value right after signing up for it. If it doesn’t, users will abandon it in a blink of an eye.  "," I was unaware of how difficult it is to grow a B2B business, even more, if it is a niche product. Also, I was not well prepared for launch there was no strategy. Promoting a product is hard. Doing so without a plan is virtually impossible. ‍",,," I think the biggest problem was the competition and the tool landscape in general. You can run A/B tests in Google Analytics which is integrated into nearly every website. If you want to do more serious testing, Optimizely is the standard tool, and they offer end-to-end A/B testing from design to implementation to evaluation of a test. You can also implement A/B tests completely on your own and use one of the countless free tools to evaluate them.",," First of all, I posted ABBY to the usual social platforms. Twitter, Hacker News and relevant subreddits, but traffic was modest. Additionally, I had some free credits for Google AdWords, so I used them for a test campaign. The keywords for A/B testing are really expensive, so the campaign didn’t result in many clicks. But the traffic was more targeted than social traffic, so I was able to convert some visitors (ABBY was free-to-use, that helped a lot). The biggest growth occurred when someone hunted ABBY on ProductHunt. That resulted in about 20k visitors and about 100 sign-ups. ProductHunt has a diverse audience, and ABBY was a niche site, so conversion rate was pretty low. But I was satisfied, as 100 sign-ups were more than I needed to validate the idea of the service."," My first job was at Jimdo, a website builder company. I did lots of A/B tests there. Even though the concept of an A/B test is simple, it’s not that easy to do it right. And the more tests I evaluated, the more I realized that people neglected documentation of results. In my experience, the results were so valuable because they allowed me to have a knowledge of what worked and what didn’t. For this reason, I built an internal tool to solve this problem and to evaluate tests automatically. My teammates liked this tool, as they stopped needing to evaluate their tests manually. Instead, they just needed to fire a SQL query, and the tool did the rest. Documentation of A/B test resulted in great benefits, too. It was so much easier to argue on what we did, how it worked and what the next steps were. Also, many co-workers found this documentation useful as a source of inspiration for what they could do next. Seeing how successful this tool was at Jimdo, I decided (with the permission of my CEO) to turn it into a stand-alone service, called ABBY.io. It took me almost nine months to launch it. Someday after an exhausting coding session, I decided to pull the trigger in a “f*ck it, ship it” moment. ‍"," I would start smaller and gather feedback before building anything. A B2B service is incredibly hard to grow as a side-project or for solopreneurs in general.  “Build it, and they will come” is a big fallacy. Finding customers can be incredibly hard. And even more, if your customers are businesses, not individuals.  Also, I tried to do too much with few resources. I only had a handful of hours per week to invest in the project. Combine that with web design, the backend part, promotion, etc. and it’s overwhelming. I considered outsourcing some of this stuff to freelancers. That way I could have focused more on my strengths and avoided getting frustrated.    I learned a lot of things from this project. The most important one was that I need better and faster ways to validate ideas. I worked for months in my little echo chamber without any real outside feedback. It’s hard to stay motivated throughout this phase, and it’s heart-crushing once you hit the outside world and nobody cares about your product. Also, you don’t just need a product, but a detailed plan on how to promote and grow your business. I didn’t know much about marketing before starting ABBY, and I think a lot of other wannapreneurs have the same issue, but it is necessary to achieve success with your startup.    Start small and find people from your network (or online) who might be good customers. Tell them about your idea and ask them if they would be willing to pay for a service like that. It’s really important to validate your idea quickly and build as little as possible before you know there is a market. In my case, I spent months building a software no one used in the end. That is a depressing experience that you should avoid.  ",," I usually blog here, or you can follow me on Twitter: @datenheini."," It’s not a business or marketing book, but I’m a huge fan of “Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman.

I guess this is the usual mistake for a technical solo founder: I made a thing that nobody really needed.

I tried the free tool route a couple of other times, but that's the only one that people were actually searching for."," Addressbin actually still exists, so I guess it's still in the process of failing. It started as an easy way to collect email addresses, mostly (as is my habit) as a way to provide myself a facility to do so for free and then expanded to allow other people. Having collected all those email addresses, it was a short step to allow people to send emails to them, which I implemented by making a special address for each list that would forward your message to each address, and just like that, I invented the Mailing List. I added a few more features (Drip messages, opt-in forms) but ultimately at this point, I was competing with Mailchimp and everyone else and decided to stop working on it. It's still up and running fine and requires very little input on my part. ‍"," Nothing really, except to spend my time on something else. At least I learned from the experience.

6,adleaf-technologies," I am a 32-years-old software engineer I’ve been working in software development for the past 12 years. My first job was in my own startup, which I started along with some college friends in a college incubator. I quit that once I got a permanent job and my parents didn’t allow me to work at a startup any further. I then served the Govt, started and failed multiple startups, and then joined my friends in their businesses. Nowadays, I’m working in an MNC Software company on AI and blockchain technology. Today we are discussing my first startup, Adleaf Technologies, which I started in 2013. Adleaf was a blend of programming bootcamps and software solutions. We admitted a few fresh engineers and trained them on web and mobile app development. We then gave them our client’s work to complete, being able to deliver dev work at a low cost. We then hired a few engineers from our bootcamp to work full-time with our upcoming batches and the rest were hired by our partner companies and job consultants.  Adleaft had three revenue streams: Money from bootcamps.Money from customers to whom we were delivering mobile apps and websites.Money from companies our trained engineers were joining. It was a perfect business model for a bootstrapped company like ours. ‍"," We started in September which is the time most students start looking for job opportunities after they have failed during campus placements, so timing was on our side. December & January is examination time for engineering students. Our running batches finished in December and then the exam started followed by a 15 days semester break.  We didn’t have running batches at that time because we had put our focus on the wrong things we were completely dependent on college students and weren’t hadn’t tried to get students who had just passed out from engineering. We completely ignored the sales pipeline for development projects and now we are also lacking on that front. We only did a small website jobin a complete 2 months period All this made my partner uneasy because he had seen huge money in the first 3-4 months and now all the money was draining into day-to-day operations. We were eyeing on college opening in March 2014 and my partner was looking to get all his money back (as much as he could, if not all). Things started derailing from there. Had no money to give advertising push and also didn’t get internal approval to hire a business development team.  We failed due to very obvious reasons lack of experience was among the main ones.  This is how events proceeded: We got revenue in the first 2 weeks and we thought of running the company with those revenues, not with the money we promised to invest in the beginning.We hadn’t hired a full time sales person to sell our bootcamp, bring business customers and supply trained workforce to consultancy and companies. I was overconfident of my past relationships and thought we wouldn’t have any issues with that.I wasn’t paying myself a salary and that was the biggest mistake that I'm never going to repeat. I was doing multiple jobs by preparing the study material for our bootcamps, managing marketing channels and talking to customers. I was also taking two classes a day. Those all tasks, without getting a single penny in return, drained me very soon. My partner wasn’t interested in hiring more staff because that would increase costs and also denied any money because the company account already had money. He upfront accused me of wanting his money and told me that he was not a fool. I started freelancing to bear my fuel expenses and that was the start of fall.We had fewer students for the next batch and we also didn’t get any development work requested. I got a few mobile apps from personal connections and I delivered them by myself because I needed money at that time. Company was falling apart and I asked my partner to leave but he asked his money back with 24% interest. Our reserves started to end before July 2014 and we were in a financial crunch. My partner said that he would not leave the company without taking money. I wasn’t able to raise any more funds. That was the end."," Here are the main mistakes: Working without salary: You have a family so, sooner or later, you are going to get exhausted and frustrated.Picking a wrong business partner: I now have a thumb rule that consists of never ever picking a co-founder from your family or friends and never picking a co-founder who doesn’t add value (besides money)Planning: Plan for 5 years and backtrack that. Iterate until you reach a level where you have visibility of the goals in the next 15 days.Realistic goals: Your goals should be realistic and also should be objective enough to get traced in a metric. Not hiring people: Not hiring sales/marketing staff is one of the most common mistakes and we’ve also committed it. Some challenges we faced were: Creating a regular sales funnel and pipeline.Lack of focus and doing a lot of things simultaneously.Building a portfolio and pitching customers. It was a chicken and egg challenge. ‍",,,," It was late-2011 when I got a call from one of my founder friends offering me to join his telecom company. Telecom was doing it great in those days and all the businesses in the industry were making good money. We met that same weekend and I was convinced to leave my Govt job and started working with him. I told him up front that I wanted to start my own stuff very soon and he said that his company would be my first customer. I joined his telecom company in the first quarter of 2012 and started working on a mobile app that could help site engineers to capture a few network parameters and create a site survey report. We came up with the first prototype quickly and got a great response from the market. 2012 was a roller coaster and we made some good money for all of us. During the off-seasons of telecom (we were working on passive infrastructure work so our work was a lot seasonal during those days), I quit the company after one and a half years and started Adleaf Technologies. That same week, a close family friend visited me and asked about what I was doing. I told him about my recent work experience with the latest company and also told him about my upcoming plans. He became really interested in Adleaf that day. The following week, I received a call from him telling me he was interested in investing in the startup. He asked me how much money I was planning to invest in it, to which I answered that half a million Indian Rupee (+$6600 USD). He offered another 500k and asked for a 50-50 partnership. This man came from the real estate business. He had a lot of money so I decided to accept it. At the same time, he offered us loans with really low-interest rates which were really helpful. That same day, I called my CA and requested him to prepare the papers for our new company. We came up with the name: Ad(vance)Leaf Technologies Pvt Ltd. The company got registered and we did our religious rituals in our newly designed office which we had made with an INR 100K investment - that was the first mistake, but I was convinced by my co-founder that old furniture would give a cheap look to our office. We bought computers, printers, and Macs. We were spending a lot on infrastructure. I invested INR 150K till then and my partner had given INR 300K. We were down with INR 450K before getting a single penny in revenue. The next day, we went to a printing shop to get our marketing material designed. We got our pamphlets, identity cards, visiting cards, office stationery, and marketing flex hangings.",," Being honest, these were the three main reasons why I started. I was born in an Indian middle-class family in a tier-three city (between 20k and 50k habitants). During my childhood, we continuously faced challenges, mostly related to money and resources. I wanted to remove this tag anyhow and wanted access to ample money for my family. So I had two options: joining the civil services or starting a business. My family and relatives still regret that I haven’t tried for civil services.Our college incubator was the second reason. They showed us the way to begin a startup we did it without any pressure, working on Govt subsidy and only paying INR 500 a month ($6.62 USD) for a full office, machines, and broadband. This was an amazing experience for two young boys.The third and the long-term reason is that I love working on solutions. I always feel a sense of responsibility when I observe my thinking patterns. I don’t find a problem as a problem but I think it as an opportunity to build a new solution. Initially, it was money that motivated me. However, to be able to drive a startup in the long term, the motivation behind it must be something else. For me, it was that continuous kick from inside that would make me be high without using any weed. I can talk about startup ideas, plans, world-changing businesses and projects, and all similar stuff, for days. ‍", The only advice to my previous self is to hold on and learn money management. I would stop myself from working without pay and would ask myself to be blunt whenever it requires. I’d tell myself that the company is above all kinds of interests and all personal relationships I was the CEO and running this company was my only job. I wish to have spent more time with my customers at the beginning. I would also like to have done my favourite exercise of planning five years ahead and then backtracking till the next coming month. ‍," First of all, we needed to bring students to our bootcamp. To do so, we started with pamphlets in newspapers and did some flex hanging at the most crowded roads. The morning after we hanged them, there were no banners. The municipal corporation’s van had picked them all. We again went to the same printing shop and ordered more material. This time luck was with us and we came to know that it was a monthly drill from Municipal corporation at least we had learned, We started getting calls from students and many parents. We got our first admission in the very first week. Our first batch started with the strength of 7. Soon, we hired our first employee: an intern that had worked with me at the telecom company. After getting a little money in revenue we thought about spending more on advertising. We went with a Facebook advert and the response was great. We almost rocked it and got 43 new admissions in the following week. At that point, we were running 5 batches a day and had got all the money that we had invested back in just two week’s time. A brilliant start by any means. We stopped marketing efforts, because we had a pipeline for the next 3 months. ‍"," You can check my Twitter, LinkedIn and Youtube channel.",," The biggest expense was in machines and office infrastructure, which we purchased upfront. Second huge expense was office maintenance on a month to month basis. We did some good revenue in the first 6 months, but I lost more. INR 3 lakh (+$4000) from my reserves and one year salary that was between INR 6-7 lakh (+$9000) at that time. In total, I think I lost INR 1 million (+$13k USD). ‍",Education,Mismanagement of Funds,India,"September 1, 2020",Chetan Vashistth,https://www.failory.com/interview/adleaf-technologies,"['https://twitter.com/chetanhere', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/chetanvashistth/', 'https://youtube.com/codepathshala']",failure,0,,"Back in 2013, Chetan Vashistth founded his first startup business called “Adleaf Technologies”, a blend of programming bootcamps and software solutions.

7,adproval,"  My name is Matthew Anderson and I’m 31 years old. Originally from Indiana (USA), I have been based in Mexico City for the last 3 years. My time is currently split between professional projects and art projects.  Professionally - I’m working with a partner to create a Shopify App meant to be the engine that powers “Subscription-First” e-commerce businesses. I am also working pretty closely with a few DTC Subscription businesses (who are using our app) as a startup strategy and growth consultant.  Personally - I love making music and painting. My first full-length album is set to release this August, I just wrapped up creating what will be my second album, and I paint regularly with my work scheduled to appear in various upcoming art shows.  Adproval was a marketplace to connect blogging and social media influencers with brands (though the “Influencer” title didn’t really exist when we started). We really wanted to provide enough choice for influencers on our platform to only collaborate with brands that they felt aligned with their values and the values of their audiences.   As it was 2011 when we first started, our primary focus was bloggers with their own sites. We started with a widget for them to easily customize embedded Display Ad slots that they could price as they wanted and receive offers from brands to purchase directly, from which we took a commission. We then expanded to broader social media promotion (i.e., “In addition to a display ad on my blog, I will tweet about your product X times throughout the month”).  I was a non-technical sole founder and CEO, so I pretty much carried all the non-technical job duties (which were handled by various contractors and ultimately a design and development agency partner). Fundraising, marketing, customer support, etc… you know how it goes :). ‍"," I don’t think we were focused enough on marketing to the Advertiser/Brand side of the marketplace. Our thought was that the bloggers in our network were already working with brands, so by providing a tool for them to make that collaboration easier, brands would be coming through our platform and we could convert them into repeat advertisers.  We didn’t really focus on that funnel, though, and found that a lot of the advertisers were often very small or just other bloggers making $5 purchases to promote themselves. Our revenue model was not right to optimize the high volume of low dollar (or even $0.00) transactions. My own hubris was a huge thing. I was building this business in a city dominated by managed services and enterprise technology… and I kind of hated it when I looked at the tech landscape where I was. It just seemed like an excuse to me to build really shitty software than charging a ton for services to make the bad software actually usable. So… I kind of refused to go down that road, and it was largely from arrogance and this fascination with the “purity of fully self-service software.” This was costly and didn’t lead us to revenue-generating activity early enough. I was also inexperienced. I was a sole, first-time, non-technical founder. My primary competitor was, at first, a technical founder who was able to more effectively bootstrap (given that he was a developer). And, later, more competition appeared in the shape of PR and Marketing Agencies that started offering what we were doing as a service without their own tech platform (an angle I wish I would have pursued more intently and earlier on). I eventually found technology partners who I liked a lot, but I was always paying for dev and design work and didn’t always have a clear vision for the necessity of certain features.   I think definitely my inexperience and some of the refusal to pursue managed services at the start of the process already mentioned. Our revenue model was also not great. I really got away from doing the things I was doing at the start of the process - building the business with just spreadsheets and static pages. I wish I would have kept doing that until we had regular revenue. For example, this whole business really could have stayed as an email list for a lot longer than it did, and I could have charged brands (advertisers) for exposure to this list with the different influencer sponsorship opportunities they had. There was an opportunity to either provide that curated experience myself (for a fee) or to partner with more PR agencies that wanted to start getting into the “Influencer” world but that didn’t have their own technology or existing network of bloggers.  I was so fixated on providing this flexible, self-service experience for each independent blogger because giving them control over their ads and advertisers was a core value from the start… but, I let that get in the way of the long term service of the market but not focusing on sustainable revenue creation. We tried pivoting at the very end, and probably pivoted into a better positioning… we shifted to build a B2B platform that brands could use to manage and track their own existing influencer or “ambassador” teams. As digital Influencers/Ambassadors became more ubiquitous, we saw an opportunity in providing the other side of the market their tool to manage their digital ambassador teams and to charge brands for our platform. I also finally found a good groove offering managed services. We helped a few brands with significant (to me at the time) budgets build out a strategy around their influencer/ambassador programs and then manually executed for them while we were pivoting the platform. This is what I wish we would have done from the start. Really - it came down to severe burnout. I didn’t know it, but I was battling clinical depression and anxiety and the stress was impacting my physical body. Some body parts had become constantly numb, and I remember driving down the highway one time when my face and hands went completely numb. I had also developed a substance dependence on alcohol to help me fall asleep at night - otherwise, I would lay there for hours and hours with a very active (and depressed) mind. So… I think I really just had to shut things down and move on. I probably could have done that earlier and saved my mental and emotional body a lot of anguish. After almost 6 years of largely bootstrapping by myself, I simply do not think I would have survived much longer. I started by telling a few advisors who were not investors. They were super encouraging and gracious. I then started telling investors one by one. I felt a lot of anxiety to tell them and had convinced myself that I was a failure… I will never forget how graciously my investors received the news, though. They were so understanding and supportive and expressed genuine concern for me for the next steps in my life and career. I quickly felt like a massive weight had been lifted off of my shoulders and remain incredibly grateful to them. ",,,,," Thankfully, the same professor who set me on the software path had been through startups before and encouraged me to start with the “fake it til you make it” spreadsheet business model. So - I used a simple landing page builder to “fake out” a two-sided marketplace with a static listing of Bloggers who were looking for sponsors (brands to partner with), and then a listing of brands with opportunities to collaborate with Bloggers. I had a Google Form on that page for more bloggers to sign up, and if they signed up, I sent them a survey form to collect more information as market research (How do you currently monetize? How many hours a month does managing your brand partnerships take? etc.). I also asked them if they had any friends who were bloggers that they thought would be interested. That helped grow that side of things at least in the static market research stage and I found out that most bloggers ran in pretty close online circles, so breaking into one or two influential bloggers in a digital community could lead to the rest hopping onboard. On the brand side, when I had a good enough listing of bloggers (just like 15 or 20) on the site, I printed out little flyers and went to a local Handmade / Vintage Goods convention (like if Etsy sellers were in a convention center). I introduced the idea to them and collected feedback and email addresses. This market validation stage probably lasted 3-4 months and was basically me having conversations with one side of the marketplace, taking tons of notes and making adjustments to a static landing page, then going to the other side of the marketplace, and back and forth. It was just me running the process with Google Forms, Google Sheets, and a landing page builder. I used Photoshop to make a little animated explainer video, made my own landing page as a fundraising business, compiled all that market research, scraped together my own cash and some friends/family investment, and then did a first small fundraising round/equity partnership with an accelerator of sorts from there. After building the MVP of the actual software marketplace, we sponsored a blogging conference with 300 attendees. It honestly went well! It helped us build a core base of bloggers using our tool. The strategy was to first launch with a one-sided approach, focused on creating a tool for bloggers that they would embed on their own blogs to create a public listing page they could point advertisers to and then manage their own queue of advertiser submissions. The idea was that this would also introduce us to brands who were coming through the widget we had embedded across the network of blogs and then we could build out the brand marketplace offering. With blogs, we charged no flat fee, just a 10% commission of display ad sales… and we covered payment processing. I pretty adamantly wanted this to be a really accessible tool for bloggers and wanted it to be a completely open self-service marketplace (as in bloggers had complete control of their own setups). We didn’t charge brands at first, either, hoping we could get enough volume to scale transactions and turn a profit. ‍"," We started with maybe 20 bloggers from the network we tapped into from our market research phase. That number grew through sponsoring the in-person conference as our first big paid marketing initiative. As every blogger using the first version of our platform (pre-marketplace) was embedding a widget on their sites, we were able to effectively generate leads through that. Probably the most impactful marketing strategy for us, though, was one that most people don’t consider as a marketing tool. Our live customer support chat was really the main driver of growth. We focused on going above and beyond with empathy and immediate responses to any support requests. When issues were resolved, we would more often than not see users tweet about how great our service and support were, which drove quite a bit of organic word of mouth. One other idea was allowing bloggers to run free “ad swaps” through our platform. Bloggers would often cross-promote each other by showing ads for each other's sites. While we knew this wouldn’t be a revenue driver for us (as no money was exchanged to pull a commission from), it did help win favor and grow our blogger network. I borrowed a customer support mantra from a friend who runs a clothing business (United State of Indiana). He operated their support with a three-word mantra: “Spoil, Reward, Enlighten.” I don’t exactly remember what each of those words meant to him, but as I adapted them to our business, “Spoil” meant replying immediately and leading by seeking an empathic connection. When a customer reports an issue with their onboarding/installation, reply with “I’m so sorry - I know it’s really frustrating for me when I spend time on a platform and something goes wrong.” whether or not it was a user error. “Reward” for us meant that, after going above and beyond to help resolve the issue for the customer, we would default to refunding. So if there was a bug (or user error) that caused it to not display properly, even if it was a user error and we were able to resolve the issue quickly, we would voluntarily refund the commission from that transaction. “Enlighten”, then, was about education and/or a clear ask at the end of an exchange. “Also - just so you know - you can now run free ad swaps through Adproval. Are there any bloggers you’d like to link up with through our system?” -or- “We have a new brand getting onboarded next week in the _____ space, would you be interested in more information about their sponsorship opportunities?” Presenting a single, clear piece of information or ask with the chance for mutual value after Spoiling and Rewarding not only helped us with whatever business metric we were wanting to push but also tied together with the whole experience for the user."," I was still in college at Indiana University when I started Adproval. Thankfully, one of my majors was Entrepreneurship and I had saved all those courses for my final year so I was able to use my own idea for all the business planning exercises in school.  I became personally interested in “how websites make money” which led to learning about digital advertising / Google Display Ads. Around the same time, a family friend’s lifestyle blog was starting to grow really quickly. I asked her how she was monetizing her site and discovered that given the relative niche of her site and the lack of control of display ad networks, she didn’t have a good system. She was working directly with advertisers from brands she was comfortable endorsing which required a lot of manual work with back and forth negotiating, ad image uploading, analytics tracking, lining up her next advertisers, etc…  From that initial point, my original idea was to be a “Blog Coach” of sorts to help set up monetization streams for bloggers as a consultant. I thankfully had a professor teach me about the limitations of a time-services company and suggested how the scalability of software could help!  Apart from this, I also ran my brother's lawn and landscape company in High School when he left for college. My family history is very entrepreneurial, though, from my great grandfather (who was one of the first inventors of the Travel Trailer / RV) to my dad (who always was tinkering with his own businesses)."," I would have told myself that you are innocent and forgiven and are worthy of love and acceptance from yourself! But I probably wouldn’t have believed me :).  Would have spent more time on the “fake it til you make it” version of the business that, in hindsight, actually could have been (and still could be) a nice revenue-generating services company. I would have tried to then build software from that revenue and would have used the credibility of that business model to find a true technical co-founder as committed with equity, not an hourly payment or cash/equity split. I was so worried about making a beautiful self-service piece of software that I spent more time on that than I did on revenue creation. I mean to be fair to myself, I would still have had no idea how to convince a brand to pay me to run their blog sponsorship programs for them at the start, either… but had I spent time doing that for free (or cheap), it could have turned into real consistent revenue streams without obsessing over the “purity of SaaS + Commission”. ‍",," Professionally: https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewroberta/ Personally, if interested in checking out my Art / Music: https://www.instagram.com/matthewroberta/ And anyone can shoot me an email if they want!"," At that time, I used to watch all the Foundation.kr stuff from Kevin Rose. He had a site dedicated to publishing all new interviews which seems to no longer exist, but they live on through YouTube and really was super helpful and provoking content. I read all the “Classics” back at the time… The Lean Startup, Art of the Start, etc. Now, I am plugged into a few Product Management groups (Product School and TopTal), will check out Indie Hackers periodically, and will binge listen to Shopify-specific podcasts. ‍"," I committed myself to live off of a small fixed salary that started at $1,500 / month and increased to $2,000 / month over 5 years. I had a lot of privileged support from my family, but I was certainly trying to live on a budget well below that of most of my peers. Our word-of-mouth marketing engines did work quite well, so beyond a couple of conference sponsorships, we didn’t spend there. Design and development were the primary expenses. With high-quality contractors, we were spending between $85 to $150 / hour for design and development. That reduced some when we locked in a cash/equity split partner but was still a massive expense that could certainly have been delayed until the “manual version” of the business model was generating revenue. I put in my own savings at the start of the business, raised a small amount from friends and family, and then did a few tranches of angel investment convertible notes over the $300k in funds raised and about 6 years of my life invested on the project. Our revenue varied a ton. While we were just commission-focused on ad sales, we’d make at most $200 / month from that fully “self-service” side of things.

8,akko," We are Jared Brier and Eric Schneider, and we’re the co-founders and co-CEOs of AKKO, the Spotify for protection plans. Just as Spotify bundled together all the songs people wanted to hear in one convenient package, we’re bundling together protection for all your most valuable personal possessions – starting with your phone, but including up to 25 other items, including laptops, TVs, audio equipment, sports gear, and much more.  Before AKKO, as folks currently know it, we were making a physical product in the vein of a smart lock. In researching warranties for that product, we realized there had to be something better out there – and since there wasn’t, we decided to make it. Once we came up with this idea, we knew we had to pivot and throw ourselves into this fully, which is exactly what we’ve done. We’ve scaled up from humble beginnings and now have thousands of customers nationwide, plus some major partnerships and new seed capital enabling us to continue growing steadily and developing the AKKO platform to be even better at suiting the needs of our partners and customers. ‍",," Jared: As we mentioned earlier, we’d started explicitly as a student plan. We had a partnership with the University of Central Florida, and we were marketing it to the students directly. That ended up being a pilot program that taught us what was working and what wasn’t. Selling to students directly was challenging because they didn’t know a lot about warranties, so we started integrating transparency and education about how insurance works in our product. And, of course, working more with students’ parents and school administrators helped us achieve better results. Eric: Once we decided to expand and go national, we had to learn how to find our customers. You might think that our base of potential customers is everyone, but it’s tough to appeal to everyone at once, so we tried to hit a number of highly specific demographics. It was like, “Okay, musicians will want this, and extreme-sports enthusiasts will want this,” and so on. So we tried appealing to these somewhat niche groups, but it didn’t work. But we learned a lot about our customers, and we learned not to make assumptions about consumer behavior and purchasing decisions without the data to back them up.  ",," Eric: We’re now in all 50 states and Canada. As mentioned, we’ve partnered with over 500 repair shops around the country through Repairs First. We’re ramping up hiring and partnerships with businesses and schools. We have 20+ people on our team right now, spread from New York to Hawaii. As far as goals, our growth has been inbound requests, and we want to get more outbound sales going. Jared: We already have a great platform that’s seamless and easy to use, but we’re almost ready to deploy a new partner portal that further streamlines our partners’ ability to sell plans and track claims, making the experience on all sides even smoother. We also recently completed a seed funding round with Fika Ventures and Pear VC, which has enabled us to continue scaling up and keep up with our growth. Eric: What we’ve done, despite not necessarily embarking on the journey with that goal in mind, is build an ecosystem. All of our repair-shop partners, our underwriters, our customers, and our other partners (universities, businesses, etc.) all live in the AKKO ecosystem with us now, and that enables everything we’re doing. The product sounds simple on the surface, but that’s exactly what the technology and the platform have allowed us to do – decomplicate what had been an overly complicated process for everyone involved.",," Eric: We first tested the concept by partnering with an established insurance company in the student property protection space. Once we saw the initial response to the product and the areas where we needed more flexibility, we switched to a new underwriting partner that allowed us to take over full control of the program and create completely customized protection and a far better customer and claim experience. Jared: The biggest question was, how do you scale an amazing customer experience using tech? From Day 1, our focus was on the design and user experience of a tech platform that would make it easy for users to inventory and protect their items, all in one place. The goal was for our users never to worry or wonder about what was protected and what wasn’t and to give them a single destination for all their support questions, repairs, and replacements. Eric: Since launching, we’ve gotten picked up organically by several news outlets that recognized the uniqueness of our approach and how much more customer-friendly it is. That resulted in a massive rise in customer and brand awareness, signups, partnerships, etc. Our collaboration with the Repairs First Association has been particularly beneficial because we can sell plans through hundreds of local repair shops and send customers to them when they make repair claims. The focus on the claims experience that they’ve enabled has been enormous for us.",," Jared: I come from a background in branding and digital marketing, but I’ve always had a passion for making music. Strangely, that’s why this all happened – I was sick of all the confusing, expensive, and unnecessarily complicated warranty plans for all my music gear, plus my phone, my laptop, and so on. I knew there had to be a way to make this better for me as the customer, and when I found out that the product I wanted didn’t exist, I decided to build it. Eric: Out of college, I was originally a jet engine engineer with GE Aviation, but I ended up moving into management consulting and venture capital while attending Harvard Business School. When Jared told me about his concept of bundling device protection this way, I knew immediately that this was the kind of big idea that I was looking to execute and help reach its fullest potential. That’s what we’ve been doing ever since.  Jared: We initially launched direct to consumer, which wasn’t necessarily the best approach for us, but because the product is so compelling, we ended up getting a lot of inbound interest and business partners. That made us realize that organizations all across the country wanted the same thing we did – a single, seamless way to protect the devices of their customers, members, students, or teams.  Eric: That led us to build an entire platform to service B2B and B2B2C opportunities, and at this point, we’re truly a universal platform that sits at the center of our repair-shop partners, underwriting options, customers, and business partners. ‍"," Jared: Our team is entirely remote right now, which is only partly a function of the pandemic. We’ve found that it’s essential to focus on building culture and community, and it’s also crucial to give our employees flexibility in terms of their location and their hours and roles.  We’re genuinely interested in their well-being because we care about them and think it makes us better as a company. The customer experience isn’t just about our direct interactions with the customer. It’s holistic. How we work with employees and teammates, how we work with partners and providers – all that goes into forming the customer experience, and none of it can be ignored.  Eric: We’ve learned not only that we have to be flexible but also that we have to be open to being wrong. In any business, but especially ours, you’ve got to listen to the customers’ needs and adjust accordingly. Always put yourself in the place of the customer. Since Jared and I come from non-insurance backgrounds, we always come at everything from the customer’s perspective. Would I use this product? Do I get what it is and how it benefits me? What’s the cleanest, quickest way that I would want to see things handled if my phone broke or was stolen?  And in doing that, we’ve discovered that a great customer experience not only helps you attract and retain customers but it also makes you an attractive partner for other businesses. Everyone wants to work with you when you’re doing things the right way. ‍"," Eric: All the inbound interest we were receiving made us quickly see that we needed to form partnerships with businesses and influencers who recognize the value of AKKO and want to offer it to their users, viewers, etc. We have these differentiators and a unique product, but it’s been about spreading the word and building a customer base that’s allowed us to achieve a sort of critical mass.  Jared: We initially focused on students and marketing directly through and at their schools, but we found that wasn’t the best avenue for us. We started to see more adoption when we appealed instead directly to parents and administrators, who are more inclined to see the value in the protection that AKKO offers.  Eric: That was also when we added the adult and family AKKO plans, which expanded our customer base far beyond our initial implementation. It turned out that once we’d built the product, all we had to do to succeed was find our audience – which turned out to be just about everyone. Jared: We’ve been working on marketing via social media and just generally trying to grow our presence as well. We’re in an interesting position as a young company that’s seen a big jump in revenue because we’ve grown our customer base pretty rapidly. Now we’re being mentioned among the industry giants. So we always feel we have to go that extra mile to demonstrate to prospective customers that even though we’re a new face in a space dominated by the old guard, we’re legit and reliable, and we keep our promises. ‍"," You can check out our website and find us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram."," Eric: I’m a poker enthusiast, and I always come back to one particular lesson from the book Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke, who’s a very famous professional poker player. In poker, you don’t often have the luxury of a sure thing you have to play the odds, and if you do that efficiently over a long period, you come out on top. So what Annie Duke advises, and this is a great life lesson in general, is to think about things in terms of the process rather than the outcome. If you make a tough call and it’s the right one, it doesn’t stop being the right one because of extenuating circumstances or luck. In the same way, if you make the wrong call and luck out anyway, you still made the wrong call, and if you keep doing that, your luck will run out eventually. Keep making the right calls, and even if they don’t all generate the results you wanted, the general effect is that you’re going to move in the right direction.  Jared: I know this might sound a little banal, but sometimes, the correct answer is right in front of you: the internet. I can’t tell you how useful it was simply to use Google to learn about our competition, their offerings, their marketing strategies, and so on. I didn’t come from within the insurance or warranty industry, so I had to learn how it works from scratch, and I was able to do that right from my home office. Similarly, I didn’t go to school for web design – I learned how to build an effective, enterprise-grade website all on my own. The tools are out there for anyone to learn an industry and start a business. Eric: I’ll add that building relationships is always positive, even if they might not seem like they can directly boost your business at the moment. So many interesting people are working on building revolutionary products so many people have compelling skill sets and life stories. You can learn a lot from people when you come at them with a curious mindset rather than a transactional one, and you’ll be surprised how those lessons and those relationships can end up benefiting you down the line. ‍",,Services,,United States,"September 14, 2021",Jared Brier and Eric Schneider,https://www.failory.com/interview/akko,"['http://www.getakko.com', 'https://www.facebook.com/getAKKO/', 'https://twitter.com/getakko', 'https://www.instagram.com/get_akko/']",success,1,No Data,"Jared and Eric co-founded AKKO, the Spotify for protection plans.

9,ansaro," I was one of the co-founders of Ansaro. Our mission at Ansaro was to use data science to improve hiring. Specifically, we focused on better interviewing.  At Ansaro, I was responsible for product design and sales and marketing. In our early days, I did a bit of data science too. We started Ansaro in late 2016 and shut down 2 years later, at the end of 2018. After 2 pivots (while staying within the scope of data science to improve hiring), we had failed to achieve product-market fit, and we shut down the business and returned our remaining capital to investors.  We were based in San Francisco, grew to a team of 6, and raised $3M in VC funding. We had a number of large enterprise customers, but never got beyond pilot contracts. We were aiming for a SaaS model, but our actual revenue was nearly entirely from services-based pilots.  Before Ansaro, I worked in consulting (Bain), tech investing (TPG), and software development (SolveBio, then a Series A startup). I studied math as an undergrad at Stanford and did an MBA at Harvard at both universities, I was interested in applying statistics/math/data science to messy human problems (like hiring!) Today, I’m a product manager at Opendoor, where I work on machine-learning products for the real estate industry.  ‍"," First, we were too slow to pivot. I attribute that mainly to building a team/culture where people weren’t comfortable disagreeing with the fundamentals of our product plan. We all got along well, and we carved out different areas of responsibility. The downside of this was that my area of responsibility was our core product roadmap, and when our initial idea turned out to be bad, it took too many months for others to question it and for me to abandon it. Second, we conflated our buyers and our users. CHROs spend a lot of time talking about how they want to hire better, but when the rubber meets the road, recruiters care more about hiring efficiency than new hire quality. We were pitching new hire quality improvement to our buyers (CHROs), but this wasn’t an acute pain point for our users (recruiters).  Third, we were tackling a problem where improvement takes a long time to measure. It requires months, and sometimes years, to see how a cohort of new hires turns out, and thus conclude that Ansaro is ROI positive. That’s way too long for a small startup. We tried to make the case for ROI based on backtesting, but that never resonated with HR buyers. I now believe that problems that require years to measure results are fundamentally better suited to large companies with deep pockets, as opposed to startups.",,,,," For our first handful of enterprise customers, we built a customized predictive hiring model for each. The advantage of this was that we weren’t beholden to any assumptions and were free to tailor to the customer’s data and business questions. This was great for exploratory models that resulted in presentations and discussions. The disadvantage was that these models were not ready to be put into production. With each new customer, we essentially started over.  After doing this a handful of times, we moved on to build a scalable platform that could do the following across customers: ingest data, fit a model, and return suggestions about live applicants. However, we failed on data ingestion, because none of our customers provided us live access to their HR systems. For some, their systems simply lacked APIs, for others it was security concerns, for others it was simply bureaucracy.  We also realized another fundamental problem: many companies don’t trust their own recruiting data - they know that applicant’s can game the system, or just straight-up lie.  So we pivoted to focusing on interviews, which most of our customers believed (a) can provide more signal than an application or resume when done well, but (b) are often done poorly today. We built a platform that allowed companies to plan structured interviews, assign an interviewer panel, and record structured feedback.  ‍ The (hopefully) headline-grabbing feature was an AI notetaker: for phone interviews, Ansaro provided a conference line, recorded the call (automatically notifying all participants beforehand), and sent the recruiter an AI-generated transcript and summary.  Problems with the 2nd version of included: Companies that prioritized improving their interviews were generally already using new applicant tracking systems like Lever and Greenhouse, which had all the functionality we had and more (the only thing they lacked was the AI notetaker.)Companies that did not prioritize improving their interviews didn’t have Ansaro functionality - but they weren’t interested in buying Ansaro!The AI notetaker didn’t solve a huge pain point. Notetaking in interviews is annoying, but not a billion-dollar problem. Moreover, the AI transcription quality wasn’t great, so recruiters preferred to spend the time taking their own notes, rather than editing a mediocre transcript, to share with a hiring manager.  ‍",," In my first job out of college (Bain), I was frustrated by how subjective hiring was. Along with a number of other recent Stanford grads, I was assigned to review Stanford student applications for the entry-level consulting position. I was struck by how differently my peers and I assessed candidates. We were aligned on the outcomes that defined a good hire (high-performance ratings, retention), but we disagreed on the inputs that generated those outcomes. For example, some of us thought a STEM background was critical others thought humanities majors did better. Some thought club leadership was a key input, others thought a high GPA was critical. It occurred to me that we could answer these questions analytically, by mapping our performance/retention records back to job applications and looking for correlations.  I started to dig into this problem in my free time in 2011-2012, and I quickly stumbled on 3 challenges. First, the data wasn’t readily available - it was spread out across homegrown systems that lacked APIs or basic file export capabilities. Second, HR leaders weren’t thinking about data science and their eyes tended to glaze over when I started talking about analytics. Third, I realized that the outcomes data (the “ground truth” represented by performance ratings and retention) could themselves be biased if the organization was biased in the way it treated some hires. So I paused. But I kept watching the HR space and by 2016, I thought the first 2 barriers were eroding. It seemed to me that most enterprises had moved to cloud-based HR systems with API/export capabilities and HR leaders were starting to get excited about data science. In late 2016, I started asking companies if they would share anonymized employee data with us and a few did so. While I was still at Harvard, we confirmed that there really was predictive power in these companies’ job application data that predicted who would perform well and remain in the job. This was a signal these companies weren’t yet using or aware of. With some proof-of-concept in hand, I went full-time on Ansaro as soon as I graduated from Harvard."," Focus on a product that can be easily tested. That means products that an SMB can try, or an individual within an enterprise can test - but that does not require the entire enterprise to test. Focus on a product that can be quickly tested. That means user benefit is measurable within hours or days, not weeks (and certainly not months or years). Ideally, the first time a user tries the product he or she can say “I see this benefiting me X amount in Y way, so I would pay Z for this.”Don’t raise money from VCs customers are using a product and that product is ready for some level of scaling. “Working product” does NOT include services/consulting projects.Don’t rely on personal charisma for initial sales/marketing it doesn’t scale, it’s hard to improve via experimentation, and it’s exhausting. Focus on more scalable approaches like online/offline paid marketing, SEO, and partnerships. ‍"," Our sales strategy relied entirely on personalized, outbound pitches from me to prospects.  Prospects were generally CHROs or Heads of Recruiting from medium or large enterprises (>1000 employees)I primarily sourced prospects via LinkedIn, then used tools like Hunter.io to infer their email addresses, and then put them onto email drip campaigns that I run using Hubspot. The cold emails had a fair amount of personalization. We had a ~3% positive response rate (willing to take a meeting or call) from these cold emails. Whenever possible, I would meet prospects in person. I would travel if the prospect was large enough or sufficiently engaged. Secondary sources of prospects were conference attendance and personal networks (Stanford/Harvard alumni network, intros from investors, intros from customers), but we fairly quickly exhausted these personal network connections. We did a little bit of marketing: Writing blog posts about HR + Data Science, better interviewing, etc.Sponsoring “HR + Data Science  Discussion and Dinner” events, where we would have ~3 guest speakers, and then invite 2-3 customers and ~10 prospects. We did not do any paid marketing ", You can check out this blog post I wrote about Ansaro’s failure.," I've really enjoyed these books: ""Drive"", by Daniel Pink, is about how to motivate people by giving them autonomy and spurring creativity.""Introduction To Statistical Learning"" goes over a terrific primer on the practical basics of machine learning.""The Design of Everyday Things"", by Don Norman, is about the key principles of design that can be applied to any system, including systems that go far beyond software UI/UX.""Venture Deals"", by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson, has great advice from years of experience on both sides of startup fundraising and structuring. For random questions I use Quora and for sourcing engineering hires, we found Hired and A-List (AngelList) to be very useful. "," Immediately before we shut down, we were spending $60-70K per month to support a team of 6, with some minimal marketing and hosting/compute costs. We brought in about $100K in total revenue, almost entirely from non-recurring, customization-heavy pilot projects. We raised a $3.0M seed round, which included $2.25M from institutional investors (Silicon Valley Data Capital was the lead investor), and $750K from friends and family. We pitched ~30 investors before we got a term sheet from SVDC.

10,aplano," My name is Tadeus Gregorian, I am 32 years old and currently based in Hamburg, Germany. Aplano is an employee scheduling tool. It covers all the necessary features needed for workforce management in businesses with up to 500 employees such as time-tracking with a punch clock, absence & vacation management, reports, availabilities, communication, and more. Currently, I am adding new features requested by our customers, working on the usability of the application, and increasing the overall performance of the application. Our business model is simple, Aplano is a subscription-based Software as a Service. For each registered employee in the application, you pay a certain amount depending on the features you need. We mainly focus on customers coming in through google and therefore set a strong focus on SEO. ",," It took us a while to find the right backend system for Aplano. Before using Firebase we struggled with slow processes in deploying the application and fixing bugs. With Firebase that problem vanished.  We were competing in a market with well-funded companies and lots of manpower. What we were lacking in experience we had to make up for with hard work and long nights. So all of us started to specialize in different areas to be able to compete. We went through a difficult period but I have to admit, it was well worth it since all of us ended up learning new skills, gaining experience, and broadening our knowledge in the saas market.  Ranking in Google was also quite the hassle. We didn’t have much experience at first and therefore faced the issue with a typical “try and error” approach. It cost us some time, but we started to understand how to deal with SEO in the end.  ",,"  The business is doing good, it’s continuously growing. We don’t have many employees. We work mainly with freelancers and get some help in for our support chat and sometimes speak to experts regarding certain topics we aren’t too familiar with. Our main expenses are the ads. Our numbers I'd rather not share yet, I fear that would cause too much attention right now, and we enjoy growing under the radar. All I can say is we have surpassed the five-figure revenue per month.  We are growing and building a solid team with a healthy work environment and ambitious employees. ",," I realized that I would need helping hands if I did this, so I brought in my two brothers and a school friend. We mocked the UI with Sketch and developed the application with the latest web technologies. Sure there were obstacles, unforeseen bugs are not uncommon, but we fought our way through. It took us about 2 years until we could go live. First, we launched the software for free, at no cost. People would use software that nearly offered the same amount of features as our competitors, but completely free of cost, with better performance and a clean UI/UX. They helped us boost our ranking on google and at the same time, they tested our tool in a way we could’ve never done by ourselves. So after all bugs were fixed and our software was running smoothly we created 3 pricing models. As a token of gratitude, our first customers will remain in the premium plan for free forever.",," I was working in a pharmacy, where I realized how even a small store needed scheduling software for its employees. The way we managed employees and their working hours was very outdated. We used excel sheets and simple pen and paper to manage staff and their shifts. This caused lots of confusion and conflict among the employees.  Before studying pharmacy I already had a passion for software development and was involved in a few projects. So after looking at the current solutions, I saw great potential. They were outdated, had bad UI, were overloaded with complicated functionality. And the barely usable ones were far too expensive. I previously had written a scheduling software just to use it in the pharmacy where I was working. The idea wasn’t to make money off it. So I wrote the scheduling software and a task management tool which they are still using, and some other pharmacies as well. But then I decided to rewrite the application (the scheduling software) for all kinds of businesses. ","  I realized that you shouldn’t waste too much time making the software perfect. Launch as soon as possible, get in some valuable feedback from customers and users. I learned that there are tons of things you can’t expect, and the fastest way to face them is to go live and put your product out there.  Staying ambitious, focusing on your goals, and spending as much time as possible on the project is what got us where we are now. There is no low-effort way leading to major success unless you are insanely lucky.","  We created a basic backlink profile for our Google presence, started a blog, and used Google Ads. So while optimizing our Google ranking we tried to target the right audience with Google Ads and later on used Facebook as well for more specific customer profiles.  We also tried cold calling for a while but realized that’s kind of a waste of time in this business. People don’t pay monthly for something they never really thought about. Well, they might, but we didn’t have any Wall Street sharks in our ranks and weren’t planning on catching uninterested fish.  After half a year we started to get in the paying customers, some big companies that would pay lots of money each month. That was a big morale boost for all of us, so we continued working on our UI, on our features, and so on. We were worried that during COVID we wouldn’t get many subscribers in, but luckily we weren’t that affected. Some major corona-testing stations signed up, with lots of registered employees.  "," So this our website.

12,aura," I grew up in Florida without much exposure to entrepreneurship or business until I met my step-father who owned a wedding company. I also saw the value of owning a company but never cared to learn about the mechanics until I became obsessed with reading business books and understanding the systems that made them possible. It also helps push you forward when you realize you’ve accomplished nothing for 5+ years “playing” business, rather than doing it.  Fast forward a few more years and I’m finishing my degree in Finance full-time and running a SaaS tool that helps Amazon sellers reprice their inventory to increase sales using AI. I can finally say that I’ve found a business that I’m passionate about driving forward.  My background is being an Amazon seller myself and growing a rather large wholesale operation where I purchased goods directly from brands and sold on Amazon. Having this deep knowledge helped my co-founder and me to build an amazing product that we would want for ourselves. Even if we failed, we would still use the product.  ",," I find you only have one of two problems: time or money. In our case, it’s time. Although we’re bootstrapped, we’re two very resourceful guys but college can get in the way when you’re trying to get it done as quickly as possible.  As an example, James is in his last semester for his Master’s in Engineering and spending this semester researching ways to regenerate neural networks if they become corrupted. Oddly, that correlates with what we’re doing at Aura but that also requires deep work sessions.  Luckily, he graduates in the coming weeks and our little obstacle won’t be a problem anymore.  I think it also helps to put problems within context. I like asking the question if something is physically possible. If something is physically possible, then you just have a knowledge or information problem. Problems are easy to solve once you understand that something is possible. Then, you just need to learn how to make it possible for you.   I’m incredibly happy that we’re bootstrapped. It made us focus on revenues from day 0. I find that’s very understated. In the early days, bootstrapping makes sense but at some point, you may need to raise money when the ROI is clearly positive.  As an example, if our paid ads are well below 1:3, CAC:LTV, we would be giving up a positive investment in our company. Being bootstrapped can mean that you capture only a percentage of that opportunity.  At some point, raising money may make sense. Not now, but maybe at some point.  Outside of that, this is our first tech company as entrepreneurs. We both run successful small businesses but this is a whole new level that we’re excited to learn about. It’s the Dunning-Kruger Effect, where your confidence is too high when you know little and becomes more realistic when you realize how little you actually know.  Now, it’s learning and applying everything that we’re learning to build the company we’ve always wanted to build.  ",," Our goal is to have a positive impact on our industry. It’s an industry flooded with “guru’s” and tools that charge incredible monthly fees for simple tech. Instead of following best practices as you would in the tech or SaaS world, they follow the “Marketing”-hype train of massive launches and little outcomes for their users.  Instead, we put more resources into engineering/development over sales. The way we see it, if a user is not better because of us, we shouldn't exist.  Where we are now: We’re trying to climb Mt. Everest, but we just started unpacking at basecamp.  Where we’re going: The only choice for repricing your Amazon inventory and a truly innovative company.  ",," The process took a little over a year of development, just to get our MVP launched. Typically, this isn’t recommended but what we’re trying to accomplish is very data heavy so we spent the extra time focusing on optimizing our architecture and building a data warehouse. We still launched with a few features not available. We started asking if we needed any of the remaining features for a user to successfully get the outcome they wanted from the tool. If the answer was no, it was left on our backlog and we geared up for launch! Here’s a “launch” video we made that you can include if you would like. Only one of us is technical as well. My co-founder built our entire platform by himself while I focused on revenue growth for our first tool and building our audience.  To launch Aura we had built a very large Facebook group by providing daily value to 5,000+ people. This gave us a direct line to a targeted audience that already knew and trusted us. To “launch” the product, we teased the launch for about a week and then hosted a Facebook Live event with an exclusive offer to the first 100 users, which were claimed very quickly. ",," I met my co-founder on Instagram oddly enough. We were both Amazon sellers but he was a bit further along than I was. We would meet once a week to hold each other accountable to our goals and talk strategy. He had already started developing our first product, which is a CRM tool for wholesale Amazon sellers called Vendrive CRM.  We started working together on the project but quickly realized we had the skillsets to do something larger. That’s when we had the idea of building an intelligent repricing tool that put engineering and data over sales and started working on Aura. We were fortunate enough that our monthly expenses were so low that Vendrive actually provided enough cash flow for us to fund our time developing Aura and getting to our launch day. It was painful but focusing on delayed gratification is a founders secret weapon!  "," As cliche as it may sound, I would not change a single thing we’ve done so far. We’ve learned a ton from our “limitations”. Answering support tickets while in class or having a lack of time more generally has allowed us to ask better questions and focus on staying lean.  It’s easy to decide to hire another person but that’s how you easily build a bloated company. Instead, we ask how could we get it done with what we do have.  Better questions, better answers.  "," Before we started working on Aura, we built a very large Facebook group/community (7,000+) with our target audience. Because we’re bootstrapped, we used time, instead of money, to acquire users. I shared everything I knew and was learning about selling on Amazon on our blog and sharing with our group. Eventually, other sources began picking up the content and sharing in other communities.  From there, we saw an opportunity to launch a weekly podcast specific to wholesale selling on Amazon, which is a specific business model that Vendrive CRM serves.  The combination of great content, a valuable podcast, our own community and a fantastic product allowed us to quickly launch Aura with greater ease.  The biggest strategy that I believe we deployed was getting people to know who we are as people. It’s hard trusting a brand new tool that hasn’t been tested yet. We made sure that was a non-issue for our users.  Now, a lot of our growth comes from our users sharing their success with our tool - by increasing their Amazon sales - in other Facebook groups, on Instagram and having influencers testing our products and sharing their reviews on Youtube.  When you build a great tool, influencers tend to come to you, rather than you tracking them down (hats off to James for that!).  "," Our podcast is called Wholesale Made Easy, you can find our CRM tool at Vendrive, and our AI-based repricing tool at goaura.com."," It’s easy to over-indulge in knowledge these days. With listicles sharing 50+ books you should read this week, it’s easy to feel like you’re falling behind. There are a few great resources like groups of entrepreneurs who actually run companies or highly recommended books from people that you respect like Tim Ferriss or Ryan Holiday.  I read at least 30 minutes every single day but the majority of my time is spent growing and running the business over fantasizing about doing so. You’ll learn far more from your own failures than you will by learning from other’s failures. Some things you just need to feel yourself to understand.

13,autto-in," Hey Failory! My name is Deepak Murthy and I am a mechanical engineering who has worked in various roles in the automotive industry for 12 years, ranging from design engineer to software developer, and currently residing in Bangalore, India. I am currently working at a media company in India, managing the engineering group as Program Manager. But before this, I failed to build Autto.in. ‍"," The shutdown was primarily due to two reasons: Our burn rate was high & the retention lifecycle of a customer was very long (10-12 months).In 2017, the Indian government made an announcement on the possibility of phasing out gasoline vehicles and going all electric by 2030. As we were part of the YC Startup School in 2017, and we were fortunate to connect with mentors and successful businessmen, we were asked to watch for long-term signs of the shrinking gasoline market. In a matter of a few days, I decided to shut down Autto.in. I came to the conclusion not work on building a company that may not last more than 15 years.  "," Our biggest challenge was hiring. Hiring full-time mechanics meant paying them even when we had no work. But we believed that hiring meant that mechanics were always ready to go and that they were of higher quality. We learned that we needed to have a continual hiring process and that a high attrition was the norm in the industry. Unfortunately, we were never able to completely solve this problem. Another mistake we made was trying to expand so quickly. After meeting many investors, we were always told that our numbers were too low. This got us into a bad cycle of trying to acquire as many customers as possible, using the fastest methods. This ended up causing the resignation of many mechanics, due to too the big work demand.",,,," I began the business, by first figuring out how to procure genuine auto parts. In India, retail availability of genuine car parts is a big challenge, given that many spurious parts are sold, making it hard to differentiate them from the original ones. Luckily, a few phone calls to Bosch, got me into meeting their local sales head who helped me to get in touch with genuine distributors. In parallel to this, I started searching reliable mechanics. My idea was to start with just one mechanic, full-time hired and based on traction & demand expand. I was lucky again, as, after screening 8 candidates, I got a really good one. I initially called the company GeniusMechanic and bought the domain on GoDaddy. The idea was to make it SEO friendly and get customers by ranking for different keywords. I built the website really simple, using Tilda. However, after receiving some feedback from friends and customers, I decided to rename GeniusMechanic to Autto.in. After getting some customer traction, I decided it was time to build a website with a booking feature. Again, without coding, I was able to do it really quickly, using Bubble, which is a UI based app builder, and Chatra, which allowed me to embed on the site a chat application to receive customer bookings.",," Autto.in was an on-demand doorstep car service provider, which operated in the city of Hyderabad, India. Our service consisted of sending mechanics to the doorstep of car owners who required general maintenance services, such as oil change, spark plug change, battery change, among others. As a car owner, I used to find going to the automotive dealer garages very expensive, as my car was out of warranty. And, apart from the big costs, I had some bad experiences with an authorized garage. This motivated me to solve this problem by myself, by asking mechanics to visit me and fix the car in front of me. ‍"," In the beginning, I focused on growing slowly with a great focus on quality. As funds were running out, I started meeting with investors and startup founders and thereby, shifting to fundraising too soon. As a result, we started to focus on growing at a faster rate, partially responsible for the mechanics burning out and leaving. Partnering with a carpool startup also was a mistake because that it the workload tremendously. In the end, I would focus on growing much slower and burning much less money by hyper-focusing in a very small community for an extended period of time. ‍  I learned a few things along this journey. Some of them are: Never try to spend too much money on customer acquisition. Instead, look for organic and innovative methods to acquire clients.Focus on retention and not on speed.Customers were very happy with our service and I realized that the India customer experience needs to be improved tremendously, which also means a lot of opportunities to make a big difference from competitors. ‍"," The first strategy we used, was really simple. It consisted of distributing leaflets across a small community of 2000 houses. Given that we converted only 1 customer, we decided to try other strategies. The next strategy was guerrilla marketing, which consisted of setting up car service camps in large apartment communities, with more than 2000 flats. This method proved to be very successful in attracting new customers, but it was really expensive. On our very first stall, we provided services to 25 cars in only two days, which was a much higher conversion rate than the leaflets. But at the same time, the cost per customer acquisition was at $12. Moreover, we also conducted some service camps on weekends, when most people were at home instead of working, which gave us better results. To reduce the acquisition cost of customers, we introduced a free eco-wash with every service bought. Surprisingly, many customers wanted just the eco-wash as a paid service. So, we introduced it with a great success. But we then realized we were losing money per wash. In India, most cars in apartments are washed and cleaned by washing facilities located within the apartment communities. Therefore, to compete against them we had to underprice massively. ‍"," You can visit Autto.in website, which is still LIVE.

14,awesomic," Hi there! We're Roman and Stacy - founders of Awesomic, an app that automatically matches design tasks with the best-fit designer. I run the company as a CEO, and Stacy operates as a COO and CMO. To launch Awesomic, we applied the shared economy principle to creative high-end design. This helped us bring together businesses and professional designers to save the time of busy founders and cover all their design needs in one app. And we've got some great feedback from our clients! ‍",," What we understood was that you always need to be ready to overcome challenges.  In our case, there was a big chance of failure due to our relationships - it's always hard to run a company with your life partner. When you launch a business with equal partnership, conflicts are almost inevitable as there are two leaders and two opinions.  Sometimes, this can cause a deadlock, but luckily, we've found a solution. From the start, we decided to divide our spheres of influence. Besides, as a CEO, Roman has veto power, makes the final decision, and takes responsibility for it.  We've learned to plan everything from the very beginning, analyze our progress, and count risks. Because success won't happen if you back away when facing challenges. ‍",," We're doing just fine. Getting new clients, hiring designers, growing steadily. At this very moment, we have 20 designers and 7 other specialists aboard - overall, 27 inspired professionals :)  Last year alone, we closed over 2,000 design tasks for 250+ companies worldwide. These include Reface, Outtalent, People.ai, SilviaTerra, Redtrack, Snov.io, MN2S. We are happy to work with such inspiring startups and agencies that grow fast and bring real value. In 2020, we also raised a round of investments from several angels that support us in different ways. All of them have extensive experience in launching and managing businesses, so it's been a beneficial collaboration. By the end of 2021, we want to expand our team and add up to 100 designers working daily through our app. We are also planning to launch a dedicated design community for European specialists, but let's keep it low key for now :) As for long-term goals, our global mission is to transform the design freelance and outsourcing industry into a new lifestyle beneficial for creatives and businesses around the world.",," We've been working non-stop. After 10 days of hard work, we had a business model and two designers ready to start as soon as we find customers. Unexpectedly, our acquaintance Tilek asked us for help with startup branding. He became our first client.  After getting the initial proof that our concept makes sense, we decided to test it in a coworking space we were renting at that time.  We had no website at first because we wanted to validate the idea with at least 5-10 successful cases before any development. That was exactly what Roman said: ""I won't write a single line of code before we understand that it's worth it."" For 2 months, we were working with clients via email. Eventually, it became unbearable to handle the whole process without a platform, so we were on to it. Roman went into a hackathon mode with energy drinks and food delivery, and the web app was ready in 3 days. So this will be our second insight - always test your ideas, observe them, and don't be afraid to make amends or even abandon some concepts if they don't work out. ‍",," Before we met, Roman had been working as a software engineer for global startups for over 8 years.  Stacy worked in marketing and communications. She's built her career from a PR manager of an Olympic champion to a CMO of an E-commerce company selling goods in 100+ countries worldwide.  It might sound funny, but we owe Tinder for our meeting - 5 years ago, its algorithms matched us together. That’s how the Awesomic story began.  After two years of relationships, we started thinking of a common business - we were simply cut out for this. We still laugh, saying that it was a perfect match not only for us but for many people eventually. Our first project was creating different apps for Shopify. We didn't have enough experience and any step-by-step plan, which we quickly realized and quit after releasing two plug-ins.  At that time, we also graduated from the Y-Combinator startup school, which was one of the key milestones in our development. It helped us understand where we'd like to move next and how to work on our mistakes. While carrying out our first project, we found out that a good developer was a rare bird on the Ukrainian market. Using Romans' experience, we decided to launch an online school for developers - Doge Codes. It was going pretty well. In 2 years, we had 200+ graduates and became the first Github representatives in СIS countries. Our concept was ""learning by doing"" - the students were mastering development while creating a real app. Yet, there was one big disadvantage - Doge Codes was a local project. And however happy we were to see our student's progress, we still wanted to work for the international market.  So here is our first insight - if you want to create something global, think on a large scale from day one because later, it might be impossible to make a big chair out of a small piece of wood. One day, we found out that we were almost out of budget, and Roman was even going to find a ""proper"" job if we didn't come up with a new business idea.  At the last moment, it hit us: design subscription - that's what everyone needs.  You know, small businesses and startups like Doge Codes often face the same problem when it comes to design. They don't have enough tasks to hire a full-time designer but still need marketing visuals and website-related graphics. Mostly, they choose to work with freelancers who are sometimes unreliable and don’t live up to the expectations.  We did quick research, didn't find any existing models, and decided to give it a try. And that turned out to be an Awesomic idea."," The greatest lesson we learned along the way was essentialism - staying focused and working as a team towards one primary goal.  What you need to do is focus on the main task until it's completed. Then switch to another one. Don't try to focus on multiple goals at once, or nothing will work properly.  Other lessons we've already mentioned before are testing different hypotheses and scaling from day one. Think big but don't be afraid of failures!  And last but not least, find the right community that will contribute to your growth and development. ‍"," Speaking of testing ideas. This rule works perfectly well when it comes to marketing, too. We started off by validating the Awesomic business concept in our local community close to our target audience. That's why, probably, the word of mouth and referrals worked pretty well for us since the beginning. Our favorite and most effective advertisement, though, was a simple napkin. There was a big conference in our coworking space one day, and many projects pinned their well-designed business cards to the board in the elevator. So what could get more attention than a usual napkin with a poorly written website address and the words ""design from $399""? This simple move helped us attract first clients, and no other marketing activity could beat it in the amount of feedback we got. To be honest, we had a great advantage over other projects. Our initial name was Pizdata, which is ""f**king awesome"" in Ukrainian. This helped us get media coverage, hype, and go viral in CIS countries. People became interested in what we did, and it gave us extra motivation. To increase brand awareness, we also worked with different media, attended TV shows, and gave interviews. But our breakout point was getting on Product Hunt since we finally reached the global market. It was unforgettable!  Recently, we've merged our Marketing and Sales department into one Growth team. This helps us see the whole funnel at once and complement each other's activities.  So here is our third insight - run a list of hypotheses and keep testing them regularly. This way, you will find your product-market fit and never miss a chance to improve your project. ‍", You can visit our website to find out more about Awesomic. We'll be happy to help you cover all your design needs at a fixed monthly fee.," We've tried so many things so far! Some of them worked, some - didn't.

15,basetemplates," Hi! I am 29, based in Berlin, and I have been building web projects and companies since I was 13 years old. Back then, I started selling graphics, websites, and scripts online and always thought: “Wow, that's amazing. I can get money for something I would do for free.” After some entrepreneurial experiments, back in university, I created my first big company, called StudyHelp, with the idea of bridging the gap between offline and online tutoring. The company scaled quite quickly to over 200 cities and a million website visits per month we also raised several rounds of funding. But, feeling stuck on the things I was working on, at some point, I decided to leave the company on an operational level. And I found something that I couldn’t stop thinking about - the relationship between founders and investors and how everything about fundraising works. Since then, I have been spending my time on two fronts. On the one hand, I decided to become an investor myself and since then have been investing in companies all over the world, from India to Brazil. On the other hand, I have been growing my company BaseTemplates and some other projects. BaseTemplates is your go-to place for fundraising material. We are selling different templates, such as pitch decks or financial model templates, and offering custom pitch deck designs. In addition to that, we are also sharing knowledge, lessons & best practices around fundraising and entrepreneurship. ‍",," For me, the biggest challenge has always been maintaining a strong focus. I am the type of person that comes up with more ideas than I could ever bring to life and gets excited about them quickly.  But having only minimal resources in my startup phase, I had to learn the hard way that I couldn’t do it all at once. And if I nevertheless tried realizing many ideas at once, I often ended up with a bunch of half-done tasks. That’s why I always create three months OKRs for myself and the company to know exactly what I will be working on - and even more importantly, what I will not be working on over the following weeks.  That helps a lot, but staying on my plan remains a huge struggle to this day.   The whole startup fundraising market is very crowded. On one side, you have all these providers of cheap templates that are bringing out new designs weekly. And on the other side, you have very focused software providers that came to the market with a lot of funding. For an independent company like ours, it's always hard to find a place in the middle and especially have visibility. That is ultimately what we are fighting for with all of the competitors. Luckily, the market in total is huge and every founder needs something different. So there are still enough people who see BaseTemplates as the best solution for them and we try to be as outspoken about it as possible.  Another huge mistake that I made repeatedly was not being consistent with content creation on our blog. I hate writing, so this is something that I always pushed to the bottom of my to-do list and ended up dropping quite often. But especially with SEO, it is important to stay consistent with your content creation. And we could have been twice our size if we had just continued to create blog content regularly. ‍",," I think that most people who are fundraising still have never heard of BaseTemplates. And I definitely have to change that. Every startup founder who thinks about raising money should be aware of us, our products, and our resources. I believe that to accomplish that, we have to work on two things. First is obviously the product itself. We have to expand the product range to help founders in every stage of their founder lifecycle. And the second is distribution. We need to be everywhere, which means more content, tools, and networking. In my vision, we will be creating a whole ecosystem for the founder & VC space. And BaseTemplates will only be one building block of that. We have already started adding additional products like FounderResources, VCStack, or Startup&VC, and we have some more big ones coming up soon. Make sure to follow me on Twitter to be the first to see it. In the end, it all comes down to the topics that I am interested in. And I believe if I just keep going in that direction, the business will succeed for sure.  ‍",," Because I had been in the shoes of my customers and made all the mistakes myself (building a bad pitch deck, talking to only a few investors, etc.), the whole process of building the company was quite natural for me. I started with my own experiences and shared them as content pieces. These were not just simple blog articles but little helper tools that I wished I had when fundraising. For example, you can have a look at our collection of pitch decks or our investor pitch training tool.  I always kept thinking about which products should be added. I started with pitch deck templates but knew that for successful fundraising, founders would also need a solid financial model and a way to track their investor relations. So I came up with products for that as well.  Luckily, I would describe myself as a swiss-army-knife, meaning I can build and design most of the stuff myself. That has saved me a lot of time and money. Another very useful thing in building BaseTemplates was no-code tools like Webflow or Airtable. Nevertheless, during the first months of running the business, I had the feeling that we were not growing and that only very few people knew about BaseTemplates. That changed when we first launched on Product Hunt. It was a quick start of what became a steady growth to the point we are now.",," When I was first raising money for my education company, I had no clue what I was doing. I neither had the network of investors nor knew how to fundraise or build a pitch deck. So, I ended up making many mistakes. Back then, I bought a pitch deck template from a small website. I liked it because of its perfect structure. Later on, I met the website’s founder, and he told me that he wanted to sell the business. After checking some of the numbers, it became evident that I had to buy the company and use my experience to bring it to the next level. And that's what I did. In 2019, I acquired BaseTemplates and grew it from one product to five. Over the years, I  have helped thousands of founders raise money for their idea. ‍"," When I was taking over BaseTemplates, my biggest fear was losing my initial investment because we would drop on the Google rankings, or no one would see the products anymore. But looking back, that was total nonsense. I would now tell my former self to have trust and just do the things that feel right, and the business success will come no matter what. For me, the biggest lever in our company history was getting our strategy right and really finding out what works and what doesn't. I wish I had spent more time on that at earlier stages.  ‍"," I am a big believer in giving before taking. And that's why I decided to build a content engine around BaseTemplates. I create valuable content like blog articles, free tools, interviews like this, and more that I use to bring people to our website. If they like the content, they will convert at some point into paying customers. Using this strategy, we have not spent a single $ on marketing for our product. One thing that was particularly helpful for us was working with partners. There are plenty of sites that are targeting early-stage founders. Many of them are happy to include BaseTemplates as an additional service for their customers. Over the last years, this strategy helped us to go from hundreds of $ per month in revenues to over 5-digits per month. ‍"," The easiest way to learn more about the stuff that I am working on is to follow me on Twitter (@MaxFleit), LinkedIn, or take a look at my personal website. For everyone who is thinking about raising money for their startup, I highly recommend taking a look at our content section at BaseTemplates. We have a ton of content and tools that will help you on your startup journey."," I think there is so much amazing content on the web that can keep you from making the same mistakes that hundreds of founders did before you. I believe one of the best sources on earth is Product Hunt, where you can find amazing products & resources every day. Also, a good idea would be to use the search to find older products that might be helpful for you. I have found some of the best resources for myself there. Besides that, I would always encourage you to join a community or find a tribe of fellow entrepreneurs. Talking about your current challenges and learning from the experiences of others is a real game-changer.

16,beardbrand," I’ve got a fairly diverse background before starting my current business, Beardbrand. My career started off in sales and I worked for a few companies doing inside and outside sales. The one that helped me the most with my career was my job as an outside salesman for a small commercial printing company. This is where I was able to hone my knowledge and experience in the creative field. During the economic crash of 2008, I lost my job and started my journey as an entrepreneur. My first business was less of a business and more of self-employment. I joined my dad’s company and tried my hand at being an executive recruiter. Placing jobs during a recession wasn’t an easy thing to accomplish, and I hung up my cleats with no success. As I faced challenges as a recruiter I started another business on the side called Wakomo. Wakomo was my first attempt into the e-commerce space and I designed and produced vinyl wall graphics (my inspiration was Blik). I built the website, produced the graphics, and had one or two sales, but I lost confidence in myself and eventually gave that up. After a string of failures, I decided it was time to start making money again and worked as a financial advisor for about 18 months. I had success here, but I found the job unfulfilling. I had the taste of freedom and working for the ‘man’ wasn’t for me. So I quit that job to start up another business, Sovrnty. Sovrnty was to be a marketing consulting business but ended up essentially being a freelance graphic design company. I gained a few clients who helped sustain me, but I never felt like it was a proper business - I was essentially self-employed and I didn’t want to be a professional graphic designer. During this time (2010 - 2011) I started growing my beard out while still being integrated into the business community. I would get lots of comments about my beard looking like Grizzly Adams, ZZ Top, or Duck Dynasty. While these guys are cool in their own way, I didn’t feel connected to those stereotypes.  I attended a beard-related event and realized there were a lot of other guys like me, guys who I called Urban Beardsmen. I wanted to unite these groups of guys and show the world that you can be stylish, professional, be a normal dude, and have a beard. At the time that was a very foreign concept, so I established Beardbrand as a way to unite Urban Beardsmen and give them the tools they needed to feel confident about their beards. Beardbrand started off through content - we had a YouTube channel, Tumblr page, and a blog. We built a small community and then leveraged some lucky press with the NY Times to launch an e-commerce business selling grooming products. The rest, as they say, is history. Currently, Beardbrand is a 7 figure business with just under 20 employees in Austin, TX. We formulate and manufacture men’s grooming products that focus on beard care, hair care, and body care. We ship out of both USA & UK to serve our customers across the world. ‍",," I’ve been passionate about our business, our products, and the community from day #1, however when building the business I never anticipated what it meant to be a leader of an organization. For the longest time, I put off managing duties with the hope that our hires would just get it. Of course, they didn’t (no fault to them), and it lead to several headaches. After about 3 years we finally understood that for the business to grow we needed to become better managers. We implemented the techniques from Traction which helped us set KPIs, improve our hiring process, and maintain our vision.    In the early days, we gave our team a lot of freedom without many guidelines, accountability, or metrics. Subsequently, it was challenging for them to know if they were being successful in their role and they didn’t have all the information they needed to make appropriate decisions. One season we made investments into inventory that would take 24 months to clear through. Fortunately for us, the product isn’t perishable and we’re able to work through it, but it’s not fun having that much capital in inventory that won’t move for a long time. Other challenges came in the form of our proofing process (or lack of one). We’ve had several products that needed to be destroyed, recalled, or re-produced because labels were wrong. After about 5 years and tens of thousands of dollars of loss, we’ve finally made it a top priority to resolve and mistakes have dropped dramatically. ‍",,," I’m an entrepreneur in the purest sense. A lot of people will always joke about the “ideas guy” and that person is me. It’s very valuable in the sense that it allows us to overcome challenges creatively, but it’s also a pretty big hindrance.  I frequently get bored and move on to the next idea. This has led to (and will probably continue to) confuse the team with the direction. Having quarterly strategy sessions has helped take away my shiny ball syndrome, but it’s still something I struggle with every single day."," Beardbrand is a bootstrapped business so keeping our costs down has always been a top priority. To do that, we started off as a retailer and tested the market with other brand’s products. If they were successful we’d develop our own and phase out the other brands. Our initial product was beard oil and I found a lot of the products on the market were a little heavy, shiny, and too fragrant. Since the product goes right under your nose, we wanted the fragrance to be subtler and from a performance standpoint it needed to be lightweight and absorb quickly into the beard. A healthy satin shine is the finish that we desired. After many formulations and versions, we settled on a formula that we believed to be class leading. The market agreed and saw great success with our beard oils. All the profits we made went directly back into the business. In the early days, we tried many different things and I always wanted for Beardbrand to be a lifestyle company, so we tried shirts, suspenders, leather products, and accessories. As much as I tried to force those products, they never got the same traction as our grooming product launches. Finally, I relented and focused on becoming a men’s grooming brand rather than an apparel company. It probably took me way longer than it should have. Beardbrand grew rapidly in the first year as we were telling a unique story at the time and reaching men who have never had a tribe before. We were one of the first companies to make a beard oil and invested heavily into educating the market. This helped us stand out and grow organically. With our unique product, brand, and sales trajectory we were able to get onto Shark Tank. Shark Tank helped give us exposure to a large audience and accelerated our growth path. I think we would have been able to get to where we are now without that experience, but I’m very grateful and lucky to have appeared on the show. We still get minor bumps from the reruns on CNBC.",,," I think we should have given more consideration to our product launch strategy and the number of fragrances we carry. The variety we provide is nice, but operationally it slows down our ability to scale and keep things in stock. It’s a double-edged sword that gives us a competitive advantage in some sense so it makes sense to keep it. It would also erode some of the trust we’ve built up with our customers if we decided to kill a large part of our offerings. At the time we made those decisions it seemed to be a smart idea.  "," At each stage of our business, we employed different marketing tactics based on the market and our cash flows. Early in the business, when we were cash poor, we spent a lot of time in the world of content. That meant tons of time on social media, YouTube, Tumblr, and Reddit. We tried to provide as much value to the community as possible and deliver world-class customer experience. As we generated more cash, we started dipping our toes into paid marketing channels. Our early investments were primarily focused on remarketing tools as well as PR. We also did a bit of influencer marketing, but never paid to have our products endorsed. We only want authentic connections with our brand and products. We continued to grow and have invested more into paid marketing through Facebook and Google. We’ve seen some success there, but we still aren’t at the level that I think our brand should be at. So, with the moderate success in paid, we’ve decided to focus on what we do best - content. Our top focus has been cranking out quality videos on YouTube daily, in-depth and thorough blog articles, and well-organized email marketing campaigns. Pair that with unique social media posts, and we feel we have something that stands out in a crowded market. ‍", Be sure you check out Beardbrand website.

17,bediwin-information-services," I’m an IT professional. I guess the closest description I could give you would be “systems administrator”, though I’ve never had that as a formal job title. Let me just clear something up: I don’t like the term “startup” because to me it conjures ideas of a trendy firm in a fashionable city like London or San Francisco burning through cash like it’s going out of fashion, with wild projections of how much money they’re going to make Real Soon Now ™. But 99% of new businesses aren’t that. They’re started up by one or two people who are more interested in paying the mortgage than they are in being the next Google. And so, it was for me - sure, I entertained visions of making an income far greater than I could as an employee, but that was as high as I dreamed. The business model was simple: take what I already did for a living and turn it into a freelance “IT-manager-for-hire” type model. That’s one thing I was always very clear on: I wasn’t interested in doing PC troubleshooting for individuals. ‍"," Directly, my first and biggest client went into administration. (I believe the US term is “bankruptcy protection”, though there are some differences). However, this wouldn’t have been a problem if I’d been able to establish a decent number of clients really, the cause was that my business model was completely broken. I did figure out how small IT consultancies get started - typically, they approach individuals and small businesses and accept they’ll be doing simple work at a low margin for a couple of years until they’ve built up a reputation and can drop the individuals - but I tried to bypass that part of the process. By the time I realized what a disastrous idea this was, it was far too late. My biggest client going into administration left me in an impossible position. By this time, I did have some other clients, but nowhere near what I needed. If I’d had another year or two, I could probably have developed the business into something viable - but I’d have the cash in the bank to pay the mortgage and bills for two years. I didn’t like the chances of getting a loan and in any case, I now had a hole in my books that would have ensured I couldn’t make repayments on a loan. Around the time my biggest client went into administration, I contacted a number of people to ask if they knew of anyone who might need my services. One person - a former manager - emailed me back and said that while he didn’t, he might have an opportunity if I was looking for a new job. I was looking at a £2,000 tax bill that would have collapsed the business and resulted in me letting my clients down. So, I took the opportunity and negotiated an overlap so I could close my business down over the course of the first couple of months with my new employer. I could have kept the business going for maybe 2-3 months - but if I’d done that, I wouldn’t have been able to pay the tax man.  I’d have had to invite the tax authorities to wind the business up - which would have meant letting an administrator call my clients and tell them their IT support had vanished overnight - and I’d have been breaking the law because I’d have been trading while insolvent. Being as about the only thing I had left at this point was my integrity, I couldn’t let that happen.  So instead I executed a very carefully controlled shutdown process to ensure everyone had plenty of notice and any outstanding debts - including that tax bill - were paid. ‍ How did you feel when you close your doors? A combination of relieved and sad. Relieved, because I no longer had to worry about paying the bills. Sad, because it meant I’d had to relinquish dreams."," Challenges you have faced in the process of building and growing Bediwin Information Services. Far and away the biggest challenge was finding prospective customers. Experienced salespeople will explain the concept of a sales funnel to you and honestly, most of that isn’t rocket science, but they won’t tell you how to find prospects to go in the top.   Your personal and your team disadvantages. I was selling a service my prospects didn’t want to a target market that was mostly in survival mode and would have seen me as a frivolous expense (at best) and a waste of time that they didn’t have (at worst). ‍ Mistakes you have committed. I assumed that my prospects would recognize the value I could offer straight away. This, it turns out, was wrong. Towards the end, I started to look at other businesses in the area and I noticed that they almost invariably had one thing in common: the product or service they could offer, and the benefits thereof, were immediately obvious. I found precisely one business that wasn’t in this position, and in that case, it had taken the owner about eight years to make it work. The second mistake I made was I put precisely the wrong amount of money in. If I’d started out the business with nothing, I would have recognized immediately that I needed to work hard to get some money in. If I’d started out the business with a very large sum of money, I could have spent that on growing the business more quickly. Instead, I put £5,000 in. Which, it turns out, was enough to leave me thinking “Hey, I’ve got loads of cash in the bank, I don’t need to worry!” but not enough to engage the sort of professional help I needed. ‍",,,," I cringe as I write this because looking back I recognize a whole heap of massive mistakes I made. What I am about to write is an object lesson in “how not to start a business”, and I would implore anyone reading this takes note because you’d probably be best advised to do the exact opposite! My working hypothesis was simple: my current employer needs a competent IT person, but they only need them for a handful of hours a week. There must be other businesses in a similar position - find them and work for as many as you can find. Sounds beautifully simple, doesn’t it? I didn’t even need a product my experience would make me a valuable asset that any company would delight in getting for a fraction the cost of a full-time salary. Put up a website, sort out a phone line, sit back and wait for the calls to come in. (Okay, you can stop laughing now. I actually did this). I think I spent a few weeks on making sure I had all the technology in place to support clients and that was pretty well it. Once it was in place, I was straight to work. The initial idea was simple: get yourself an IT support contract and get professional support in minutes. ‍ Who was involved? This was my first mistake, and one I never really rectified. One of the first things I did was engage a marketing professional to help me research the market. It didn’t really do me any good - I paid £400 to be told “I’m sure your business idea is viable - I know a chap doing something very similar - but I haven’t been able to find anyone who might be a potential client! Most of the people I’ve spoken to have been extremely rude in telling me they weren’t interested.” In retrospect, I should have taken this as a warning. ‍ What resources/tools did you use? A few things: A VoIP phone. These are great you can choose a phone number from pretty well anywhere in the world and have it route to the phone. You don’t need a new phone line fitted it works over your broadband.A phone answering service. Initially, I redirected the phone to my mobile, but that just made me look amateurish when it went to voicemail. There are lots of companies out there I used a firm called answerjam - they offer a pay-as-you-go service and it’s all set up online. Redirect the phone to them, let them take a message and they’ll text it to you.Wordpress. It’s quite easy to set up a reasonably professional website with this later on, I discovered Themeforest (which has a range of high-quality templates at stupidly cheap prices). Combine this with some stock photos and you can get a great looking website for £50-100.Bomgar. This is a remote support product that I’ve used for many years. It’s a Rolls Royce product with a price tag to match, but it’s worth every penny. I’m sure you’re hoping I’ll list off a range of “idiot’s guide to marketing” books, but the truth is I didn’t find any of these particularly helpful. Most of them would have been great at providing inspiration for someone who already knows a bit about marketing, but they were lousy for someone who doesn’t know enough about business to even know that a marketing strategy should exist, let alone what it should look like. ‍ How did the initial product look? “Product”s a bit of a strong word in this context quite simply, there wasn’t one. The website, however, looked cheap. Because it was cheap. I had zero contact from it and in retrospect, I’m not surprised. It didn’t start to look good until I bought a proper theme for it and paid someone to write some copy. ‍ Did you enjoy the process of getting started/building it? I did, but in retrospect, that’s because I was deep in Dunning-Kruger territory. I had absolutely no idea of the depths of my ignorance if I had, I’d have been paralyzed with fear. ‍ Did you launch/publicize your product in any way? How did that go? Did it go as expected? I advertised in the local press, bought ads on Google and generally did everything I could think of to make a splash. It was a disaster. I had no concept of a sales funnel, little idea of conversions, A/B testing, market research, positioning within a market…. the list goes on and on. I tried to appeal to everyone and in the process appealed to no-one anyone with any business experience will tell you this is a recipe for disaster I started from there and it didn’t get much better!",," Honestly, my options were a bit thin on the ground. I’d moved to a new town with limited opportunities for my skillset my employer was happy to let me work from home but shortly after that they made me redundant. Realistically, my options in the locality were to take a 30% pay cut or start my own business. And if I was taking a massive pay cut anyway, I wasn’t going to answer to some other bastard! ‍ What's your background? What part of your background defines you, and possibly led to starting Bediwin Information Services? I grew up the son of a self-employed accountant most of my mum’s clients were themselves self-employed. In those days, a small business owner could (with enough sacrifice) put a child through a private school. So many of my friends growing up came from families that had a business of some sort. So, I didn’t perceive it as being particularly risky I just saw it as another way to earn a living. ‍ How did the idea come to you?  I knew my employer needed me occasionally - but the keyword here is “occasionally”. They certainly didn’t need me full-time. In that respect, their decision to make me redundant was absolutely correct. So, I offered to take redundancy and contract back to them on the understanding that I was free to seek other clients when I wasn’t dealing with them. They accepted this offer, became my first (and, for that matter, biggest) client and that gave me a basic income to get started. ‍", You can’t always get where you want to be in one go. Sometimes you have to make lots of small steps to get there. The business you’re looking to set up is one such example: most of the successful IT support companies that started small targeted individuals as well as businesses and only dropped individuals from their portfolio when they’d established a sufficient reputation. ‍," I don’t think I’ve made clear how ignorant I was. I knew literally nothing about marketing or sales. I read marketing books, I spoke to marketing experts but all of this expertise had one thing in common: it assumed a certain amount of understanding of the basic subject matter. Books seemed to concentrate on “101 ideas to market your business!” experts simply nodded, smiled and took lots of money from me. It took me the better part of two years to recognize that marketing was different from sales and business strategy was different from both. Before that, I was just throwing ideas around and seeing what would stick. I did, however, pick up a few important things. Any experienced business owner will probably read every one of these and say “no kidding”, but here goes: Business to business marketing is a totally different animal to business to consumer. It isn’t unusual to find marketing people specialize in one of these.B2B marketing - particularly for high-value services - is very much carried out the old-fashioned way. You need to develop a relationship with your customers over a long period of time you simply can’t phone someone up on Monday, pay them a visit on Wednesday and have a signed contract by Friday. Brad Burton (owner of 4Networking) said it best with “Meet, like, know, trust.” It’s something he repeats like a mantra and he’s absolutely right there.The sort of things you can market to a small business - and the strategies you employ to do so - are also quite different to what you might use to appeal to a larger business.Yes, networking can be a great way to get yourself known and meet new prospects. But be very careful about signing up to an organization offering regular networking meetings - they’re often full of people who’ve been suckered into a pyramid scheme.Marketing to small business is probably rather closer to B2C: develop a product that solves a problem and sells that. If you can’t explain the problem you’re solving in ten seconds, you probably don’t understand it well enough.The problems that bother small businesses are typically closer to “how will I get the money in to meet payroll?” and “if this invoice isn’t paid, I’m not going to be able to cover the mortgage next month”. More abstract questions like “am I working in the most efficient way possible?” seldom appear on the radar frankly, even if I’d offered my services for nothing it wouldn’t have helped because my prospective customers wouldn’t have been prepared to sacrifice the time to speak to me. ‍"," I’ve decided that running an IT support business isn’t for me.

18,beehiveid," Hey! My name is Mary Haskett. My first startup experience was a skydiving school that I ended up running when I was in college. I competed in skydiving at the collegiate level and had a lot of fun, but I learned that there is no money to be made in skydiving. But that experience was enough to convince me that I could start a company so after I got my master’s degree I founded a training development company that I grew to profitability over ten years without outside funding and then sold to a defense contractor. After the acquisition, I joined the company as a Vice President and learned a lot about biometrics and working with the Department of Defense (DoD). I deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan on a number of occasions and had some amazing experiences.  I realized that I like small companies, so I left to start another company that primarily builds software for the DoD and foreign governments. My current company stems from that experience we took what we learned working with biometric identification software and moved from software to building hardware. We built a portal for high speed face and iris identification – basically, we can identify people in real time as they walk by at a full walking speed. I’ve just formed a company for this product and it’s called Blink Identity. ‍"," There were two major issues. BeehiveID depended on access to Facebook data, and that was fine because Facebook was very open about wanting other people to use their data - all the way up until they decided they didn’t. After we had been building this technology for about a year, Facebook announced they were shutting down access to the data we depended on. Major lesson: don’t build a company that is dependent on data you don’t control. We pivoted to a different solution - “selfie authentication”. People used their webcam or phone to take a short video, and we used biometric face matching and voice biometrics to ensure they were a real person. But that solution had way too much friction. We pivoted because the rug had been pulled out from under us and we needed something quickly. We should have gone back to the beginning and started with market validation for the new solution before deploying it. But the company was already in trouble and I was in denial. Basically, if you are a dating site, you don’t really care about fraud, because it’s a future problem and you are under enormous pressure to grow your user base. So even though every site told us that fraud was a huge concern, their behavior didn’t match their words. Dating sites only work when they have a large number of people to get matched up to and they weren’t willing to do anything that reduced the number of users. At the end of the day, fraud really wasn’t a problem they were willing to spend any amount of money to solve.",,,,,,," We applied to the Techstars accelerator with the concept of “Twilio for Biometrics”. We were going to build an API so any developer could quickly and easily add biometric identification to their software. This was back in 2013 and when we did our customer discovery, we got a lot of blank stares. It was probably way too early. But we did learn that there were huge problems with online fraud that were really identity problems. When you do business with anonymous people, you have no recourse if they turn out to be assholes and we felt like we could address that problem. If you want to defraud someone online, you create an account with a fake identity and use stolen credit cards. Then the real credit card owner discovers they have been a victim of identity theft and the credit card company reverses the charges. The money is taken back out of the online merchant’s account but they have already mailed the merchandise. Online merchants lose a lot of money this way. BeehiveID identified online accounts created for fraudulent use. My technical co-founder has a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering and had an interest in social network analysis. He came up with the concept of using social network analysis on the data available through Facebook in combination with a few other tricks to identify a fraudulent online user. This is how BeehiveID saw the social network graph of a fraudulent online account. This is how BeehiveID saw the social network graph of a real person. So, the idea was that a person would log in to a site using the Facebook OAuth and BeehiveID would comb through the data available through Facebook and let the site know if the account was fake. It’s still a really great idea. (If only a great idea was enough.)"," I am competitive and determined to win, and I’m not a quitter. But until you quit what isn’t working, you can’t do the next thing. I was so determined to make it work that I didn’t hear what the market was saying. Dating sites were a terrible beachhead market. We were not getting traction. Every site we spoke to talked loudly about being worried about online fraud, but when push came to shove, they weren’t actually willing to do anything about it. Friction was a much bigger concern than fraud.    I learned that my opinion doesn’t count, only the market’s opinion. And you have to listen to actions, not words. People might tell you they love your technology but unless they are willing to give you a credit card number, the words mean nothing. ‍"," I chose the online dating industry as our beachhead market because online trust and safety were so obviously important there (more on that later). We used the Techstars network and our personal networks and got introductions to two dating sites that became our first beta testers. The algorithm needed to be validated - we needed dating sites that would use BeehiveID and then validate whether we correctly identified the fraudulent users. The founders we worked with were passionate about creating safe online communities and we couldn’t have developed BeehiveID without them. We also blogged and did all the traditional content marketing. Later, we spoke at trade shows for the online dating industry and were able to reach out to the larger companies in the space. By the time we shut down, we had personally spoken to the majority of the dating industry, large and small and we eventually realized that even though most of them claimed to be very concerned about fraudulent accounts, in reality, they knew a huge percentage of their accounts were fake and had no desire to do anything about it. ‍"," My new company is Blink Identity and here is the website. You can follow us on Twitter at @blink_identity. We are currently in the middle of the Techstars Music ‘18 program and this time I’m focused on customer validation and figuring out the most efficient way to bring our product to market. My co-founder and I are very interested in online privacy and we write about the intersection of identity technologies, privacy and public policy here."," This is a bit nontraditional, but I recommend this book all the time: “The Partnership Charter: How to Start Out Right with Your New Business Partnership” by David Gage. The author is a business expert who mediates conflicts between founders and the book has many stories from his personal experiences. The key concept is that when you go into business with another person you need to have detailed and difficult conversations about money, division of responsibilities, values, etc. and your business documents should be the documentation of these conversations, not something you downloaded and skimmed. He said if he meets a founding team where there are two people and they each own 50% of the company, it usually means they just haven’t had the difficult conversations yet. ‍"," We had investment from Techstars and RightSide Capital. When that money ran out, my co-founder and I decided to keep the company running with our own money. We lost the money, but we learned a lot.  ‍",Software & Hardware,Dependence on Others,United States,"March 17, 2018",Mary Haskett,https://www.failory.com/interview/beehiveid,"['https://www.blinkidentity.com/', 'https://twitter.com/@blink_identity', 'https://www.tacticalinfosys.com/blog']",failure,0,,"BeehiveID was a startup on the dating market, that identified online accounts created for fraudulent use.

19,bildr," Hey hey! I’m Mark, an 80s kid from Austin TX, and the CEO of Bildr.com 👋 Bildr is an all-in-one platform for visual web development. Build web apps, launch SaaS products, create Chrome Extensions, and build the future with web3, with or without code. The full stack is handled so you can focus on building with all the powers of a seasoned developer at hand. Extend Bildr in any direction with custom JavaScript and APIs to anything. As a startup CEO, I’m focused on the go-to-market and working closely with customers to successfully launch their products with Bildr. Bildr is a Freemium service with “Launch” & “Pro Tiers” as well as a lifetime Pro access pass available as an NFT and purchasable with ETH.  Currently in open beta, we are covering all hosting costs for your apps and will announce hosting pricing in the first quarter of 2022. ‍",," Where to begin… The most challenging part of a startup IMO is handling the daily or even hourly swings. Super highs and super lows. Keeping even and staying the course is paramount. In our services business back in the day, we had to learn the hard lessons of understanding our value and how our perception of ourselves translates into reality and success. With Bildr, the learning comes straight from users and customers. It’s a constant process of failure and iteration. Sometimes these are small things and not very costly other times, they have a tangible impact through lost time and capital.",," We are doing great today. We are a distributed team of 12 and are incredibly excited to watch customers build and launch their products using Bildr tools. Adding web3 tools and products to the mix has been exciting in this 4th quarter we see this as a great magnet to bring people into visual development. The excitement in the space and opportunity it presents is unmatched. On a personal note, my wife and I just celebrated 17 years of marriage, and our 3 kids are at an age where we get to have a lot of fun as a family—especially looking forward to traveling more as a family this coming year. ",,,," Myself and two partners launched my first company while I was in college. I dropped out shortly after to focus full-time on the business.  What started in 2006 as the dream to create what would become Bildr quickly pivoted into a services business when funding for “no-code” developer tools fell on deaf ears about 15 years ahead of the market. We didn’t let that kill the visual development dream, though. Instead, we served customers using early versions of Bildr to create custom web apps faster and with fewer resources than our competition. As time went on, our customers continued to request more advanced features, so we continued to expand the capabilities of the tools to match that need. A few years ago, as the market caught up to the concept of visual development, we decided to spin Bildr out as a separate product company. So in July of 2020, we took the plunge, formed the newco, and began iterating with early alpha users as we completely reshaped our internal tools as a product suitable for market adoption. We are incredibly excited to be launching out of beta in Q1 alongside a suite of web3 and NFT products driven off of Bildr’s uniquely extensible architecture. ‍"," From a product perspective, listen to your paying customers, stay the course, stay focused. As cliche as it is, grit is the way when trying to do big things. Years of being in business have created a great network to lean on. We raised our pre-seed round from friends, family, and former customers. Most of our team has been together for many years on other projects. Consistency has paid off in a big way for Bildr, and I’m confident that trend will continue. "," We are super early here, but so far, the best marketing has been word of mouth and providing incredible customer support. Traction started early with a waitlist, but we quickly learned that Bildr being on the more advanced side of visual development tooling, many of the early signups were not a good fit for the product. One of the lessons learned during this process is recognizing and being happy about this outcome. To define your customer, sometimes you also need to know who is not your customer.", WebsiteEducational portalBlogBildr TwitterPersonal Twitter," Slack for internal comms, discord for community, and we rolled our own project/task management tooling. The tool we use the most is Bildr itself. This will likely be unique to Bildr for a very long time because Bildr is built with Bildr. Not just the website but the entire platform. Everything you use as a product is made with Bildr, so our team spends most of the day in Bildr, just like our customers.

20,birdy," I’ve been building for the web since the 90’s. I’ve always been entrepreneurial, so caught the SaaS bug around 2003. I’ve built and launched dozens of web apps. I’ve tried to grow a few of them into real businesses, with only a couple small successes. In the last couple years, I’ve concentrated on a WordPress plugin, Kanban for WordPress, and hope to grow it into a day job in the next couple of years. Before that, my biggest success and failure was a web app called the Birdy.  "," I made lots of mistakes along the way. I made technical errors, as it was the first large web app I had to scale without help. From a business perspective, I could never figure out how to monetize it, which kept me from being able to bring in help, which caused more scaling issues. Personally, I couldn’t think big enough. I tried adding freemium features, but in hindsight, I would’ve done better in searching out business partnerships.                                                                                                                                          ",,,," Probably the biggest mistake I made was trying to build it into a business without a personal safety net. Everyone told me there was big potential. I had a lot of users. But no one wanted to pay for anything, I I had to pay rent. I struggled with the pressure to earn money quickly, where I think a long-term strategy might’ve lead to more success.  ",," The simple premise of the app appealed to a lot of people. And since I initially offered it for free, people didn’t hesitate to sign up. A couple weeks after launching, I sent an email to LifeHacker and a few other productivity sites. Six weeks later, lifehacker.com wrote about it, and usage hockey-sticked from there. Over the next few years, it grew to tens of thousands of active users."," The Birdy started as a simple way to track my terrible spending habits. Over a weekend I built an app that would email me once a day, asking, “What did you spend today?”. I’d reply, listing out my purchases, and the web app would track them.  "," I wouldn’t take it so seriously. The Birdy was a cool little app, and it certainly had potential to become something bigger. But in the beginning, it’s simplicity was what made it special. Instead of letting that worry me so much, I would just let it ride and concentrate on making sure it lasted for a long time.  Have a solid network of people to talk to. That helped me immensely. Don’t quit your day job. And start saving money now if you intend to launch a business. Personally, I found that I make bad decisions when there’s too much financial pressure. If I don’t need a product to pay my rent, I can maintain a longer-term view and do what the business needs, rather than what I need.  ",, You can see some of my other apps here!,,,Finances,Lack of Funds,United States,"March 17, 2018",Corey Maass,https://www.failory.com/interview/birdy,['https://gelform.com/'],failure,0,,The Birdy was a simple app to track spending habits.

21,bizzbee," Hi, I am Dancho Dimkov, a young entrepreneur, a father, husband, and the proud owner of BizzBee Solutions. For the last 5 years, I and my team are working on building and growing an impeccable LinkedIn outreach growth strategy for B2B SMEs via LinkedIn messages and emails.  We are the ever-going full powertrain behind many successful business relationships that had a growth potential from the very beginning, but all they needed was just a little push. So, we try to be that little subtle push that SMEs need. So far, we are doing a great job.  Also, for the whole last year, I’ve worked on my first book, which is at its final editing stage, so we are expecting it to be published any day now.  But, it doesn’t stop here, of course. I have many projects under my belt, one of which is offering content creation as a new service.  My already existing services as consulting are about to be upgraded and improved, so I also have big plans for this part of my business too, so stay tuned! ‍",," When I founded BizzBee, I made the mistake of relying solely on freelancing platforms as my primary source of work.  It was a good short-term strategy, but I clung to it for much too long. I was afraid of rejection, and I didn’t reach out to people.  That was something that could have killed my dream right from the start. Luckily, I decided that even though I am terrified, I am going to do my best. I will dive into the wild waters and swim with the big sharks.  Either they will eat me, or I will learn how to swim with them. At first, I did everything wrong, of course.  I was that needy, pushy salesperson that I now teach people not to be.  You can now see where that comes from and why I tell people not to do it. The chances are, making your first move a sales pitch will only get you the rejection you are so afraid of.  If you approach people with the sole intention of selling them something, they will give you the leg. Instead of selling, you should be building.  Yes, you read that right. Building rapport, connection, relationships with your prospects.  Instead of just talking, try listening to people. Instead of assuming, try asking.  That’s the right and the only way of doing outreach. ",," One thing I am working on right now is offering content creation as one of our primary services.  I am also working on enhancing and improving my consulting services. You know, I am the kind of man who never stops working, and I truly believe that there’s nothing perfect in this world and that everything could be done better, every comfort zone could be expanded, and every end-destination is just a passing stop.  Also, I mentioned that I am eagerly expecting my first book to be published, but guess what? That’s not going to be my last one, of course.  Writing has awakened some new sides of me that I didn’t know existed. So, ‘Sweet Leads’ is not my last writing station.  And did I mention the academies? No, right? Well, it would be a shame not to tell you a few words about those plans of mine, too. I am planning to launch an Academy for the practices and the mastery of doing outreach where I and some of the best-known outreach experts shall share our knowledge on this abundant topic. My end goal is to help as many SMEs as possible, so they can help other people, too. ‍",," So as I mentioned, my business days started really early in my life.  It's just like they say: When it's right, you know it. And I knew that I was somehow destined to become an entrepreneur.  From a very young age, I started buying, selling, and reselling candies, CDs, and whatnot.  My first more serious project was AdvertSMS. It was a college dream of mine and a couple of my friends, and even though it didn't last long, it served me as a lesson on what to do next.  Launching a business is never easy. It comes along with high levels of stress and anxiety. And not to mention loans. That's why it is important to find the right strategy.  Though it may sound dreamy at the beginning, having your own company, reality quickly comes barging in.  In the beginning, I depended entirely on freelancing platforms. That was okay when I had only 4 interns working for me. But then a big project came out of nowhere, so I had to hire a few more people.  Having 10 employees only meant that I couldn't rely solely on the freelancing platforms anymore.  That was my awakening moment. If I wanted to have my company up and running, I had to start looking for some serious work. But knowing that nothing great comes without risk, I put my ego and fears aside and started to reach out to people.  At first, I was doing it the wrong way. I was desperate to sell my services, to show the world what is BizzBee all about, and, of course, I failed.  That's how I learned not to make decisions out of despair. Being salesy and pushy got me nowhere. So when I changed my approach, when I started reaching out to people with the sole intention of starting a conversation and building a relationship, the numbers changed, too.  Within 12 months, I and the bees grew the company from zero to 20 employees, supporting more than 100 companies worldwide across different industries. And within 24 months, the company grew to 35 employees, and the number of clients we served doubled to 200 (see our Portfolio), as well as doubling the company turnover. ",," My entrepreneurial days didn’t start with BizzBee Solutions. I always had a hunch for business. So, it all started back in college when me and my friends founded AdvertSMS. These were my beginnings, the place where I learned how to do market research. This was my first project, my stepping stone to more serious projects of my own.  The next thing I did was to enroll at Sheffield University, where I acquired an MBA, which was of tremendous help in my business journey. Having the theory and the practice, I knew I could aim for big things.  Afterward, I started working for Retell Ltd, a Dutch software development company, as head of their R&D department. Though this job was bringing much-needed income, it was way too corporate for me.  Meanwhile, I was doing some freelancing, which I came to realize, was bringing me much more. And I don’t mean just money. I mean much more satisfaction, joy, and fulfillment. I was doing something that I liked. So once again, I was at a crossroads.  Should I keep my steady, high-income job, or should I pursue my high-risk dream? The answer came to me in the most unusual way. It was delivered in the sweetest of ways, by a bee. I come from a long line of beekeepers, so I consider bees to be sacred, holy even.  So one day, as I was dragging my feet to my fancy corporate office, I saw a bee, joyfully enjoying the nectar of a fragrant flower in front of the building where I worked. It had no worries in the world because it did what it wanted and did best.     That was the sign from the Universe that I needed. I quit my job and started doing my freelancing full-time. Though fruitful, freelancing wasn’t an option for the long run. I needed stability. So, 2015 was the year when I gathered a small team of 5 interns, rented an office and a couple of desks and computers. It was how ‘BizzBee Solutions’ was born.  At BizzBee, I had the responsibility to teach interns how to do market research the right way. It was the first thing that we offered as a service, along with many others that came later before we specialized in outreach."," In the B2B world, it is of high importance to learn not to rely solely on paid ads.  Don’t get me wrong I’m not saying that paid-ads don’t serve their purpose, but don’t forget who are we dealing with here.  Serving and working with high-ticket service providers require some serious preparation, a well-thought detailed business plan, and short and long-term strategies, not just paid ads.  They work splendidly in the B2C arena when you are addressing a different type of audience and offering not-so-pricey services.  So, what I am saying is first, know your target.  In my case, what has worked best was reaching out to people. I used, and I still am using, LinkedIn as my main work platform.  Going out cold is scary for sure, but it’s the only way to get yourself some of the valuable connections you desperately want.  But, please, don’t get me wrong. Approaching the cold way does not equal bothering or spamming people. Nothing gives us the right to attack and invade someone’s personal space without being asked to do so.  What I’ve learned when doing outreach over these many years is instead of focusing on selling our services, we should focus more on establishing and building a valuable connection with our potential prospects.  Mastering skills like listening, and I mean listen to what the other person is saying without offering them a relatable story of yours, is one of the first steps of this long-term outreach strategy of mine. Because people can sense when you really listen and when you genuinely care.  And that’s how you slide them down your sales funnel.  When you have established a grounded, caring relationship with someone, the sales meeting is just the next logical step in your relationship. ‍"," Well, don’t let me get started on how many strategies, tactics, and methods I have changed over the years.  But, I do not dwell on my mistakes. They are just reminders of the many milestones I had to pass to get to where I am now. And I’m well aware that where I am now is not my final destination. There are many goals I have yet to reach and realize.  At first, when I founded BizzBee, I made the mistake of relying solely on freelance platforms. Using freelancing platforms as a source of work did last spring, but it couldn’t serve me for the long run since my business was expanding, and I had more and more employees to get busy working.  That’s how I started using LinkedIn and email outreach as my primary business strategies.  It did take me a while to learn how to do outreach the right way, and I am still learning, but I realized that it was what I did best and what I wanted to continue doing.  Mastering the art of doing outreach, whether via LinkedIn or Email, goes hand in hand with mastering the art of creating mind-blowing content.  That’s why I have carefully gathered a small team of first-class copywriters that create awe-inspiring content as they breathe. And my next business steps are related exactly to content creation, so do put your seatbelts on and prepare for some seriously adventurous ride!"," You can learn more about BizzBee at our website, or at our LinkedIn page, or at our Facebook page.  Also feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or add me on Facebook."," My all-time favorite is the Marketing Secrets podcast by Russel Brunson.

22,blogging-for-devs," I’m a software developer and former engineering manager based in Berlin, Germany but originally from the United States. Most people I talk to aren’t confident about where I’m from, because my accent has gotten pretty weird by now! About 8 years ago, I moved to Europe for a research job at the NLP chair in Leipzig, Germany. After getting tired of academia, I transitioned to working for a high-growth fintech startup in Berlin. Spent 5 years there, moved up the ranks, and finally, quit to go full-time on my products. These days I’ve got two main gigs (I mean that literally, they could both be full-time jobs and together take up well over 40 hours per week). But the one I’m here to talk about today is called Blogging for Devs. It’s an email course, newsletter, and paid community that helps developers grow their blogs without having to be “famous” on social media through excellent writing and SEO. Today, the community is about 350 members strong, with about 250 of those paid. It recently surpassed $2K in MRR, over $25,000 in revenue, and 7,500+ newsletter subscribers. ",," So far, I’ve gotten incredibly lucky with Blogging for Devs. But that’s mostly because I made all the classic, first-time founder mistakes with my first product, Affilimate: No distribution plan beyond “build it and they’ll tell their friends”Not diversifying the customer baseHaving a time-sensitive marketing plan that relied solely on SEO (which has a timeline of its own, especially in a competitive niche like affiliate marketing). Thankfully, I was able to do the opposite of many of these mistakes with Blogging for Devs and it had a positive result. And I’ve managed to turn around most of those with my SaaS, too, and things look wildly different than they did a year ago. Some things just take time :) ",," Just last month, I brought on help for the first time! One of the community members, Stefanni Brasil, is working part-time to help with all the day-to-day work that goes into running a community. For example, integrating new members, aggregating guides for people to discover community resources more efficiently, event planning, and tons of stuff you can’t just automate away and needs the human touch. In terms of revenue and expenses, I publish income reports every month where people can get a detailed breakdown. Running a community is a lot more expensive than people think: you need to glue together a lot of tools, but also facilitate larger groups. As a result, you end up in the “mid-sized” or even “enterprise” bucket for a lot of SaaS subscriptions. On average, we do about $2,000-$3,000 in revenue per month and usually about ¼ or ⅓ of that in expenses. In terms of growth, I mostly rely on growing my newsletter and count on that to keep the community membership healthy. I’m not looking to make it massive, as the intimate community vibe can be eroded quickly when you have a ton of new joiners at once. My goal is more to scale up my SaaS than to try to turn the community into a money-making machine. In that sense, it’s more of a passion project than something I plan to turn into a giant business (at least for now). I’ve got a stretch goal of reaching 20,000 newsletter subscribers this year. It’s a bit of a stretch, but I’m hoping with a few launches I’ve got up my sleeve, I’ll be able to hurl myself over the finish line somehow :)",," The first version of Blogging for Devs went from idea to launch in under 3 weeks. I’d heard so many versions of the mantra, “Launch fast. Get emails.” and I took that to heart. I used ConvertKit to create an email course, delivered as a sequence over 9 days: an intro email, the 7-day challenge, and a conclusion email. Thanks to about 8 friends who agreed to be beta testers, I iterated over the email content about 2 times before deciding to go live. The main thing I did was cut the scope, and focus on making the course outcome-oriented: “Create an optimized article for your developer blog, step by step, in 7 days.” After that took off, I launched a private, invite-only community that was free for the first 100 people. I wanted to test whether it was the right format, and also form the culture slowly and intentionally at the beginning. Eventually, it took up so much of my time that I knew I needed to go paid. I gave myself the famous “12 startups in 12 months” challenge and launched the community as a paid offering in under a month. My main marketing strategy was building in public on Twitter and growing the waitlist that way. Within the first week of launch, over 20% of the waitlist had converted to paying members. ",," Honestly, I never wanted to build a product for developers before. Nor did I ever plan to become a “creator”, but here’s how it happened. Back in 2019, I started my first SaaS product: Affilimate, an affiliate dashboard for content publishers. It was born out of my experience building my travel blog, growing it to about $5K monthly revenue, and getting frustrated trying to keep track of my affiliate income and which strategies were driving conversions on my website. Especially as a developer, I knew there had to be an automated solution. So I launched the product alongside my partner Gernot, and together we recruited about 70 test users. They were in the travel niche, just like me. Start with what you know, right? Well, you can imagine what happened in 2020. In a matter of weeks, we went from landing our biggest customer and having our first $2K revenue month to everyone asking to pause their subscriptions. Suddenly my projects were earning under $500 per month in profit, and I had to lean on my savings. After taking some time off to grieve my failing business (and playing a lot of Animal Crossing) I decided to try something new. I launched Blogging for Devs as a free email course in May 2020.  It grew to over 1,200 subscribers in under two weeks. Eventually was voted #1 Product of the Day on Product Hunt. And when I launched the paid community 6 months later, net $10K in its first 6 weeks of being open for registration. What made this experience different is I started with a distribution plan from the beginning: a Twitter audience I’d built over years of blogging and conference speaking. My biggest lesson was how important it is to build distribution for your product. And that, in fact, without a reliable distribution channel, it’s almost irrelevant how good the product is in the first place."," Two main things: distribution is everything and the power of email. I’m still largely focused on my SaaS product in terms of what I’m looking to grow into my main income stream, but if I had to start from scratch, I’d do an email-first strategy today. So much of the marketing activity I work on these days revolves around optimizing for email engagement. Didn’t expect that coming into this experience! But on top of that, I learned just how demanding it is to run a community. There aren’t any days off for good behavior: you have to show up every single day and be there for people. Communities don’t run on their own without someone there to facilitate, build connections, and make things happen. Even when I’m on vacation, I still check into the community at least once per day. "," The main thing I’ve done to grow Blogging for Devs is building word-of-mouth growth into the product. For example, right after someone confirms their email address for the free course, I ask them to share the course on Twitter. I do the same after the person has completed the challenge. This ensures there’s always a steady stream of people publicizing the product for me. Another funny side effect is that by helping developers blog, they often end up writing about my site: this results in backlinks and more people talking about the newsletter in public spaces where developers hang out. These days, visitors from Twitter subscribe at a rate of 20-30% on the newsletter homepage. Even higher when the recommendation to join comes from someone else who’s respected as a tech blogger (sometimes over 60% opt-in rate!). So it’s by far the most effective way for me to grow the email list. One thing that hasn’t panned out yet is using my rankings of the top developer blogs to get subscribers through organic traffic. I still need to experiment with what kind of email opt-in formats are going to appeal to developers when visiting these rankings, without annoying them too much. As you might know, developers are sensitive to popups and impervious to most lead magnets. So it takes a lot for a random dev online to surrender their email address. In terms of revenue growth, the email course acts like a funnel for people to join the community. Students get the fundamentals they need to act, and the option to join the community and work on their blogs with a group of peers in two final emails at the end of the course. One announcement email, one with FAQs. I can’t say they are perfectly optimized, but it’s the main way people hear about the community and eventually join us as paying members. "," Apart from Blogging for Devs itself and my personal blog, I’m also relatively active on Twitter @monicalent. Trying to share what I learn!"," As for tools, I use ConvertKit and Circle to run the paid community. All the videos are hosted privately on Vimeo and I use Descript to edit and caption them. In terms of resources, I talked about this in my 2020 retrospective: One article that changed the game for me was Amy Hoy’s article about Content Marketing that Sells. It’s about how to attract customers through free projects through a technique called side project marketing. This mindset heavily influenced the way I build and launch projects in a way that everything kind of compounds together. Especially as a developer, it’s so much easier and less expensive for me to create side projects that help me grow my revenue-generating businesses. Apart from that article by Amy, I can recommend some great online business and marketing blogs for readers of Failory: Detailed.com (SEO blog), Gaps.com (online business ideas and in-depth case studies), and Marketing Examples (marketing case studies).

23,boston-apartment-hub," I have been working in sales and marketing for the past 12 years. My career has taken me from Google to domestic manufacturing. Lately, I have been getting back into the online world with my website Practical Golf. I’ve been at it for almost three years now and built it up to an audience of about 500,000 golfers per year. ‍"," The main problem was that both of these processes proved much harder than we imagined. Convincing the real estate agents to pay for another service to list their apartments was difficult. It was a newer format that challenged the status quo of the industry. There were only a few agencies that were willing to listen in the beginning, while the rest of them were not interested. Additionally, the data entry process proved to be very cumbersome as well. It took a full-time person to manually update all of the listings and making sure that they were getting the latest information from the real estate agents. Simply put, it was a much bigger problem to solve than we first imagined.  ",,,," In retrospect I believe this was not a project that should have been bootstrapped by just a few people with a relatively small budget to develop technology and do sales outreach. If it were a larger company backed by investors I think it possibly would have had a greater chance to succeed. Also, that particular market was very averse to changing the way they did business at the time. In a way, the idea was probably too ahead of its time. ‍",," Our process was twofold. We had to first do outreach to all of the agencies and convince them that they should have their apartments listed on the site.  Secondly, we had to import all of their data, and make sure it was up-to-date so that apartment hunters could be confident that listings reflected the current market."," Right after I graduated college I was hoping to help my brother with this business. The concept was to “clean up” the apartment rental market in Boston by featuring reliable listings that apartment hunters would know was verified. Our goal was to work directly with real estate agencies to broadcast their listings to the marketplace in order to get their agents more business. The service was free to use for the end user, and our revenue model was based on agencies paying to have their listings on our site. ‍"," I’m not sure we could have done anything differently. In that environment, the technology was not near where it was today, and that was one of our main stumbling blocks. The site could have been developed for a fraction of the cost today, but there was no way we could know that back then. The time and place for the business idea were just not right. Sometimes that is just the way it goes!  I learned a lot from this project. Personally, it proved to me that I wasn’t ready at the time to be a full-time entrepreneur. I knew that I needed to develop my skills more in the workforce before I felt confident enough to execute a strategy more effectively.  Additionally, it showed me that “going all in” is probably not suited for my personality. A lot of people don’t realize how much pressure there is on you when you have no other source of income to survive. Personally, I have had much more success doing a side project now and growing it slowly rather than disrupting my life in order to validate my ideas.    I would advise going the route of starting small and not risking everything if this is your first project. The harsh reality is that most new businesses will not succeed and I think from a strategy perspective it makes sense to get more validation on your idea before you are willing to quit your day job.  ",, If you are into golf be sure to check out my site Practical Golf.

24,botnim," SHAKED: Hola! I`m Shaked, a 29-year-old digital nomad software engineer. Other than nomading around the world (🇳🇱 🇩🇪 🇲🇽 🇺🇸 🇦🇷 🇮🇱), I've been doing calisthenics & MMA for the last 1.5 years. ‍ GILAD: Hi, I'm Gilad, and I'm 33. I used to work as an analyst in a consulting firm in Tel Aviv, but now I'm on a new path to make stuff on my own. I'm also an investor and a market speculator. As an economics student in the Hebrew U, I rented an apartment in Jerusalem and Shaked's brother was my flatmate. Later I spent one summer in Berlin and Shaked was also there visiting. We became friends and talked a lot about starting a business together, but we waited until the time was right. ‍"," SHAKED: The main cause of Botnim’s failure is that we didn’t validate the market and most likely took the wrong direction. It is actually very simple: people who eat outside usually DO NOT care enough about what they eat & people who care enough usually DO NOT eat outside. Those who care enough, like my self-tend to cook at home & if they eat outside it’s likely a cheat day.  ‍"," GILAD: So for me, it was the dependencies. Driving 45 minutes to the lab every time was exhausting and time-consuming. And It took much time and energy talking to restaurants, persuade them to join, persuade them to pay for the food-check, going like that door-to-door, and realizing that we can’t make a progress at one front without a progress in the other. Restaurants wanted to see users, but they wouldn’t come without restaurants, and restaurants asked how many users do we have before paying for the food-check. I figured that this is not how I want the business to come about. It’s like we were a low-tech business, with just an app to support it. Of course, if we had money then a guy would have delivered the dishes to the lab for us, or we would have paid for ALL the food checks just as a proof of concept instead of asking restaurants to pay, etc. But we just couldn’t go on like this. ‍ SHAKED: I think that what disturbed me the most and always felt like a problem, was the fact that I want to keep on traveling and live abroad. As Gilad mentioned that would have been quite complicated thinking about the way things worked. ‍",,,," SHAKED: Botnim started as a Messenger chatbot. The main reason behind it was that chatbots are very easy to develop. I have already been working enough time with chatbots in order to know that it would take less time to be ready for production in comparison to a website that looks good on all devices. I think that the main difference is that developing chatbots means you don't deal with UI at all, and coming from a more backend background that was a great solution, so I developed it using PHP on a nginx server. Unfortunately, there are also tradeoffs. Using chat in real time - e.g walking in the street and looking for a restaurant, seemed like an issue. Messenger's bots sometimes have slowness issues which were unacceptable. The worst thing happened when we showed the chatbot to business owners and we had to apologize for its slowness. At that point, we took some time to rethink about Botnim’s concept. After few days, maybe a week, Gilad came up with the idea of creating a map that will show all the dishes we have and allow users to filter them by different nutritional values and food preferences such as vegan/vegetarian/all. Few days after I sent Gilad a link and the map was there integrated with all of our data. This was a huge breakthrough because this time business owners loved it. I built Botnim.co using PHP, jQuery, Bootstrap (even though I'm sure I could have skipped it) & MapBox - as it works much better than Google Maps. ‍ GILAD: I remember the day when I first went door to door after changing from the slow ugly bot to the map. Every single restaurant was interested and thought it was cool. Once the website was available, we spoke to our friend Naama which is a graphic designer, asked for some design improvements and she volunteered to help. At the end, we got a very nice result! As to the business model, in hindsight, it was quite a complicated model. We were counting on getting paid from 3 different sources: Restaurants - paying for showing their dishes and promoting them on the app.Users - while it was meant to be a free service, we did think some users with special desires or needs will be willing to pay for unique searches, like allergens and stuff like that.The Laboratory - we figured that since we’re supplying the laboratory food to analyze, we could charge commission from the laboratory, based on volume.Funny enough, the lab was the only source that right from the beginning stated their willingness to pay. The lab people knew that they will get their fair share either way. Coordinating 3 sources of income on the first attempt for a startup was a bit unrealistic I think for two people.",," SHAKED: Botnim was all about finding dishes around you by their nutritional values and location. I started getting into calisthenics, MMA and generally into fit in mid-2016. While and before doing that I used to eat outside - which is probably not the best thing do especially if you do that 3 times a day. So, after few months into the fitness world, my nutritionist friend built a menu for me and I started to cook at home. For most people, it's a hassle to cook at home, but even when they do that, sometimes they just can't get back home nor carry food & have to eat outside. This all thing happened exactly when I came back to Tel Aviv after a year in Berlin. Tel Aviv is very much into fitness & good food, so it looked like this would be a great service to have for people who care about their diets, including myself of course! Once I got to this point, I called Gilad and told him about the idea. He loved it and we started working on it. ‍"," SHAKED: It’s easy to say now, but market validation is definitely one of the 1st things I’d do. Specifically, in Botnim’s case, I would have checked with people what they want before assuming it, then execute accordingly. ‍  SHAKED: As a maker & software engineer, the most important part is not to be attached to your code. Going from a chatbot to a web application meant throwing all of the chatbot’s code and not looking back. Thinking about this decision retrospective, it was one of our best decisions. Having said that, I think that it is a good practice to have something first and then improve/change it. ‍",," SHAKED: Definitely active on Twitter where I also tweeted about Botnim. Other than that I have a blog and I'm active in a Telegram group called WIP. ‍ GILAD: You can find me on Twitter @giladmp and on WIP. We have decided to travel to Mexico and work from there for a couple of months. Being able to start a business with no ties to a specific location is important to us, so traveling will definitely force us to stay flexible in that regard. We have some ideas for new projects. If you’re around, say hello :)"," SHAKED: Personally, I recommend following makers on Twitter. I like hearing interesting stories and Sarah Ball is definitely someone who got them. Also Ernst Mulders - This guy was too young to open a company so he asked permission from a judge. If that's not a reason to follow him, what is? ‍ GILAD: I agree. Also, I’ve never read entrepreneurial books. I feel it’s more of a try, try again thing. Do successful people did what they did because of other guy’s entrepreneur books? Maybe, but I doubt it. I follow Andrey Azimov. He's not famous (but he will be). He's a great maker, and he's doing stuff right. Good energy & good ""try, try again"" modus operandi. Also Pawel from VanSecrets. He works hard and has an ultra-fantastic product which makes me jealous. ‍", GILAD: We had no “investments”. We used only our own money. ‍ For every dish a restaurant paid to be checked in the lab we also paid for one. Dish check cost ~$80.

25,bounce," I’m the co-founder of Bounce, a network of 1000-plus store locations for luggage storage and package acceptance. We help travelers find places to store their bags and accept packages through the mail in hundreds of cities around the world. By partnering with local businesses such as laundromats, shipping companies, convenience stores, hotels, and other companies, we provide an additional revenue stream for our partners while also giving our customers a useful, in-demand service. ‍",,"  When we first started, we didn’t account for the seasonality of the travel industry. So there was a point when our revenue stopped growing, and we got very worried that it would never come back. Revenue eventually picked up again, but it taught us that seasonality is very much part of the travel industry and something we need to plan around. ‍",," The business is currently doing very well. The global pandemic of 2020 was challenging for the travel sector, but we’ve emerged from it a leaner and stronger company and have been able to pivot toward additional services such as package acceptance. Right now, we are very much in a growth phase and are hiring for several positions. We’re hoping to build a lot more functionalities into Bounce in the future. ‍",," I first conceived of Bounce as an Uber for your things. The idea was that you could drop off your belongings at a local business and have them deliver them to you somewhere more convenient. But an idea is pretty much useless until you get it out in front of customers and see if it’s something they need. So we threw a landing page up just to test the waters and had our first ‘Bounce’ request five minutes later.  In the beginning, my co-founder and I were riding around New York City on bikes to deliver people’s luggage. That was the very first version of Bounce, and we began writing code after that. But keeping up with the growing customer base took up all of our time, and there seemed no way to scale it. It was hard to imagine we could pay someone enough to do what we were doing and deal with the logistics of meeting customers. So we shifted to a model where customers would drop off their things at a Bounce location, and we sent them to another Bounce location. When we implemented that, we found that a lot of people were willing to pick up their bags at the same location they dropped them off at, which made things a lot easier from the logistics side.",," I’ve lived and worked in lots of different places. I’ve lived in over a dozen countries around the world, and all that travel forced me to be something of a minimalist. I used to travel with everything I owned packed into just three suitcases.  All that travel taught me that, far too often, people are planning their days around their things instead of enjoying the experience of traveling to new places. People have to lug heavy bags around with them and sometimes even have to cancel plans because they don’t have a place to store their things. It occurred to me that it would be great to have a central app or website that could help people find luggage storage quickly and conveniently wherever they were. That’s how Bounce started. The initial idea was to build this network of luggage storage facilities in the densest cities in the world. As the idea grew, I also saw an opportunity for package acceptance and receiving services. Before creating Bounce, I worked at Intuit where I built software for small businesses, which is similar to what we do at Bounce.  I’ve been an entrepreneur since I was a kid. I was always trying out new ideas and ways to build cool things. Along the way, I’ve had plenty of failures and partial successes that taught me more and more about what it takes to run a business and bring a new idea to the world. ‍"," First-time entrepreneurs think mostly about the product. Second-time entrepreneurs think about distribution. I’ve learned a lot about the importance of distribution and its role in a company’s growth. And although I already knew that the team behind a company is critically important, I’ve learned a lot about how best to build that team. Surround yourself with the right people, who will take an idea and run with it, and you won’t go wrong. You have to make time to build that team of people that you can share your vision with and have them make it real. Do that, and everything else has a way of falling into place."," We tried everything! We handed out flyers. We tried organic search. We tried paid search. You name it, we did it. We tried everything to get the word out. We started to gain traction as we picked up more customers and people got used to seeing the name Bounce around the city. We began to get recommendations from people in tourism-facing industries. People would ask a concierge at a hotel or an attendant at a museum where they could store their bags, and they would recommend Bounce. Word-of-mouth was very valuable to us as a new company. ‍"," You can visit our website, usebounce.com.","  I love using LinkedIn. I just used it to hire for a role.

26,branch," My name is Sib, and I’m co-founder and head of product/growth at Branch Office Furniture (Branch), an NYC-based startup with the mission of making it easy for growing companies to create an office their teams will love.  We sell our own line of office essentials: desks, chairs, conference tables, lounge furniture, and accessories. Then we handle everything from office design to delivery and installation. As you grow, move or needs change, we help you update your space plan or trade your furniture in for credit toward your next purchase.  For those who haven’t furnished an office before, reviewing the status quo might help illuminate why we’re different: growing companies typically face two bad options when it comes time to buy office furniture.  On the one hand, you can go with “fast furniture” from Ikea or Office Depot, solutions that are cheap and fast but lack quality and service that scales to the needs of an enterprise (try asking Ikea to negotiate with your landlord about freight elevator access or union labor). On the other hand are “contract furniture” solutions like Herman Miller, which make wonderful physical products but sell through middlemen dealers that require you to navigate an opaque sales process, wait 6-12 weeks for delivery, and pay markups of up to 50%. With either solution, when you outgrow your space, you’re stuck with the furniture: most people just throw it out, which means 17 billion pounds of office furniture in the trash each year.  With Branch, outfitting your team with a standing desk, ergonomic chair, and filing cabinet costs as much as a single chair might cost from a high-end furniture dealer, with transparency, flexibility and full service included. ",," Building an ops-intensive e-commerce startup is scary: when ordering our first run of inventory, we found ourselves wiring a good chunk of our pre-seed funding to our factories in China. If you haven’t raised much money or are bootstrapping, managing working capital is key. Once you demonstrate traction, you’ll be able to secure an asset-backed line of credit to finance your inventory. Until then, it pays to negotiate supplier and payer terms to minimize your working capital needs. In general, operations is the toughest part of our business. We’ve learned that writing clear service level agreements (SLAs) to govern our relationship with fulfillment partners avoids issues later on. What happens if goods are damaged in route? What are the penalties if your supplier ships the wrong color of a product? If you don’t know what a good SLA looks like, ask someone running logistics at a similar business to help. Be prepared to do things yourself to learn what to expect from your partners my co-founders and I have delivered and built probably hundreds of pieces of furniture ourselves.  PR is tougher for a B2B product, but we’ve learned that every business has angles relevant to a general audience. If you’re solving a big enough problem that customers care and like you, there is a reporter and audience out there who will care too. Figure out what you know that will change their thinking about the area you’re building in. Provide evidence if you can there’s nothing like compelling data for a successful pitch.  We made too many mistakes to count! It sounds simple, but here’s a general concept we’ve gotten much better at applying over the past year: identify critical assumptions early on and dig as deep as you can to verify them. What are the key things you have to believe for your business to succeed? If they’re that important, stress test your assumptions!  For example, we made assumptions about the availability of a certain acquisition channel early on based on anecdotal evidence, but didn’t verify until it was too late. In a weird way, for smart people in particular, it can be tempting to cover your eyes and avoid digging in because you’re worried about a key assumption being proven wrong.  Resist the urge to protect the sunk costs of your thesis better to go back to the drawing board early than plunge into months of work under false pretenses. ‍",," We want to grow Branch into the one-stop-shop for office furniture through a company’s entire lifecycle. This implies launching in more markets (we currently serve 30 metros in the United States and Ontario in Canada), adding more furniture to our curated line, hiring for our team (we’re at 10 people right now) and launching software and tools to help our customers manage their furniture during and after their transaction with us.  In the world we want to create, your physical environment at work will configure itself seamlessly to your needs so you and your team can be productive, healthy and happy. Imagine the “API for office furniture,” where your furniture, floor plan and accessories shift according to hiring, expansion and the changing needs of your business. ‍",," The first order of business was figuring out our actual product: our initial line of workstation furniture. Right after starting the business, we raised a little money from friends, family and a few angels. At this point, we had little more than a deck and a few dozen customer interviews. We needed the funding to head over to develop our first furniture products if you’re building a software business, you might not have to raise right away. Though we wanted to manufacture in the US where we are based, we realized that small-batch manufacturing domestically would be prohibitively expensive for the time being. After researching a half dozen countries, we settled on China due to its exceptional value and quality for price in manufacturing durable goods, even with tariffs many of our high-end competitors manufacture in China as well.  In October 2018 my co-founder Greg flew to China, hired a translator, and began visiting factories. We ultimately found two manufacturing partners who agreed to take a risk--many high-quality vendors are as selective with their partnerships as their retail partners are--and produce a test run of furniture for us. We ended up kicking off with an adjustable height desk, standard desk, open office benching, and an ergonomic chair, striking the balance between a lean line and a complete solution.  While Greg was finalizing our initial line, I was working on building our digital presence. We decided to launch on Shopify because of its robust infrastructure and selection of apps, found an off-the-shelf theme and customized it to our needs. Once we received our samples, we hired a photographer and took our first photos great photography is paramount for a visual product like ours. In February 2019, we officially launched.  This was one of the more stressful phases of building the business: the two of us and our third co-founder Verity were paying ourselves little to nothing, and encountering new questions every day on everything from international freight forwarding to furniture design. ",," I’ve always been interested in starting a business. Beyond the financial upside, the variety of work, the (relative) agency of being your own boss and the satisfaction in bringing something new into the world appeal to me. I’m also fascinated by systems and organizational design. If the first act of a strong executive team is building a product or service that customers love, the second act is building the culture, processes, and team that enable sustained excellence in executing on that mission. Building a great culture is the only durable competitive advantage, and it seemed like a fascinating challenge.  But it took me a while to develop the conviction to do something on my own. I spent the first few years of my career at a real estate tech startup called Redfin, working on special projects and incubating new businesses within the company.  I had an incredibly cool job as a generalist at a fast-growing startup and learned a ton about products and startups from my mentors at Redfin. I wouldn’t change my first chapter for anything, but three years into the job, I was convinced it was time to strike out on my own. I had saved up some money, with few liabilities, and wanted to take a swing with my risk tolerance at its peak. So I quit my job without knowing quite what I wanted to build...and began a two-year journey to figure it out. I spent part of that time traveling the world and consulting on growth with a variety of startups to make money and learn about different organizational styles and markets (also to have fun).  Then I moved to NYC (where I’m from) and co-founded a pre-idea incubator for interesting people in tech working on their next thing. In hindsight, I’d recommend spending more time validating a thesis before quitting your job, but there’s value in open-ended exploration as well if you can swing it. I ended up as an EIR at a small venture fund in NYC and decided to spend one last summer working on ideas. That’s when I got introduced to my now co-founder Greg. He also came from the real estate tech world, and a mutual friend introduced us I knew nothing about office furniture when we had our first meeting. Greg had spent the past two years running real estate operations for a flexible office space company, where he encountered the issues with buying office furniture firsthand. When he spelled out the problems with incumbents, and the opportunity to create a 21st-century experience in a huge market, I was ready to hear more. Two months later, in September 2018, we incorporated the company. "," There are tons of things we could have improved on a tactical level, but here are a few of our biggest learnings: Map out every step of your operations and mark where issues occur visualizing where your incidents occur helps you prioritize when negotiating SLAs with partners.Budget carefully and assume that surprises will arise. We included a contingency in our model for legal fees, freelancers, salaries, damage and more, and it’s a good thing we did because those mistakes add up fast.Great photography is critical to conversion. We should have invested in high quality photography earlier than we did, but we’ve done better in recent months (see below!) ‍"," We serve businesses between 25 and 300 people, and divided that target market into a few core segments: for example, the “WeWork Graduate” is a 25 person company that has relied on co-working but is ready to invest in their first space. Within each segment, we identified a key decision-maker (who might be a CEO at a smaller company, or a facilities manager at a larger company). Our clients can spend tens of thousands of dollars with us, so segmenting and understanding their needs is key to driving successful outreach and conversion.  We also spent a fair amount of time mapping user journeys for each segment. Because office furniture is a large, complex and important purchase to most clients, lead generation for our sales team is the primary focus of our acquisition funnel, although we expect ecommerce transactions to grow in volume as we add social proof and case studies.  We generate those leads and transactions in three ways. Online acquisition is important for us, and until recently we’ve focused on driving organic traffic through content marketing and PR, which generate direct traffic and improve our search rankings by driving backlinks to our site. I can’t overstate the importance of PR as a new startup. It can be tough to land coverage, but every article you land has a triple impact on your funnel: driving direct traffic, generating a powerful SEO backlink, and providing credibility that can improve conversion. Now that we have a new brand and website, we’re beginning to experiment with paid search ads.  Beyond online channels, we acquire customers through direct sales and channel partners in the real estate and design communities. In general, we prioritize growth channels by scale potential, cost and purchase intent: office furniture is mostly purchased at certain points in a company’s lifecycle, so channels like search that directly capture intent in the query are especially valuable to us relative to social channels, which target the right people but not necessarily at the right time.  ‍"," Check out our products and story on the Branch website.

27,brisk," I am a computer scientist who stumbled into starting a startup (called The Astonishing Tribe) back in 2002. We were six friends who built an art project then we were contracted by Sony to help them improve the performance of their mobile phone user interfaces. We didn’t want to be selling hours, so we claimed to have a product - and off we were. In 2010 we had grown to 180 people, and that year we were shipping in over 12% of the world’s phones from vendors like Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, and Sony. And we had designed the first version of Android’s user interface. Suddenly, we got an offer from Blackberry, who was the biggest smartphone vendor at the time, to acquire us for $150m. We joined, and as we didn’t have any venture capital investors, it was a crazy deal for us. After that, I worked two years running M&A for EMEA for Blackberry at the same time as I started angel investing. Both roles taught me a lot, and I realized that I needed to get back into the trenches and started another company. This time I did an AI company (Brisk) doing prescriptions/action recommendations. We raised $2m from VC and angels, and after four years and some amazing customers, we decided that we were not going to get the flywheel going. We did a soft landing and sold off the assets to a price almost lower than the legal fees. After that, I started an angel group, NordicMakers, and spend most of my time being an angel and helping startups. I founded a local startup community and a startup house but hired people to run operations for both.  I also blog a lot here. ‍",," We should have been more focused and built a smaller product. The biggest headache of building Brisk was that we had two “open surfaces”: both the data and the user interface.  We were flexible on what data to use and how to interpret it (What is a good deal in your Salesforce instance? How long time should one wait till call again?) and the user interface and user. We allowed a lot of different use cases and ended up having a very unfocused development, onboarding, and sales. Salesforce is a very flexible system, and we ended up spending massive amounts of time to support all the different customizations that were done and then propagating that to the user.                                                                                                                                                       ",,," One of the biggest problems we faced, except our own lack of focus, was the fact that we were dependant on Salesforce and were a value-add to them. A lot of our potential clients believed that Salesforce would end up solving the problem were tackling. Others felt that we were “polluting” their infrastructure by adding non-Salesforce components to their otherwise “clean” Salesforce system.",," Two things really worked in marketing. The first thing was doing a freemium B2C2B strategy where we had individual salespeople install a free version of Brisk, which we then contacted and helped out to turn it into a sales opportunity of the paid company version. The second thing was that we did a lot of user-driven content marketing. We interviewed a lot of users as we needed a lot of customer development. Instead of just throwing away these insights, we turned them into marketing material blog posts, a podcast, etc. These drove a lot of traffic to the free product."," Brisk was a prescriptive intelligence company - meaning we recommended what actions people should do next for optimal results. Our first focus was to use sales data to help inside salespeople what to do next with every deal. There is a lot of signals around sales, in the CRM, in your inbox, calendar, and online, but salespeople use little of it and end up being rather random in their actions. ‍"," We should have tried to solve a smaller problem better. Now we ended up having a half-assed product, instead of half a product. We didn’t really solve anyone problem completely. We should have decided on one target group and one of their problems and solved that elegantly. Now we ended up having multiple people’s multiple problems, on top of a very customizable infrastructure that we had to adapt to.    Solve a focused, critical problem. Don’t try to solve everything, but one, very important thing. It doesn’t matter if the solution isn’t perfect as long as you work closely with your users and solve something worth a lot to them.  ",," I blog a lot here, tweet at @hajak, do a podcast on governance/Blockchain on Itunes or SoundCloud.",,,Software & Hardware,Lack of Focus,Sweden,"March 17, 2018",Hampus Jakobsson,https://www.failory.com/interview/brisk,"['http://www.hajak.se/', 'http://www.twitter.com/hajak', 'https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/governing-the-future/id1244476147?l=en&mt=2', 'https://soundcloud.com/hajak/sets/governing-the-future']",failure,0,,Brisk was a prescriptive intelligence company which suffered from lack of focus.

28,browserless," Hey everyone! I’m Joel Griffith, a Portland, Oregon based Software Engineer (now turned entrepreneur) that’s been working a ton on this thing called browserless. browserless is, at its essence, what I call “chrome-as-a-service.” What that means is that when a developer needs to have programmatic control over a web-browser as part of their service they can use us to provide it. We take care of installing the browser, running it in a streamlined fashion, and other small details like making sure fonts are installed properly. Right now, the #1 reason users use it for is generating nice PDF files from their website, which can be a pretty hard thing to do. This service is incredibly useful for a number of things, such as capturing screenshots, PDF generation, and data-gathering. Unsurprisingly there’s a lot of players out there already, however, practically none of them offer on-demand programmatic access 24/7. It currently generates revenue in two ways: an old-school license model and a monthly subscription for “hosted” access. Currently, I’m working on a new usage-based account type that does per-second billing. This has been an incredibly interesting feature, and often requested, since it’s really cheap to get started ($0.00008/second!). ‍",," Taming Chrome and getting users! Chrome (which is the defacto headless browser) is just crazy-hungry for resources, so babysitting it and providing a web-service around it is crucial. Some folks don’t even put things like concurrency-limits around it and just let their apps go crazy running Chrome jobs, but there’s such a high-risk of it bringing down your entire stack if you don’t contain it. This is why having something open-sourced is extremely helpful: just because I maintain the project doesn’t mean I know everything about it and can fix everything. The community sort of gathers around the best-in-class and helps to make it better. Getting users and understanding their feedback can especially be challenging when starting. I think it’s important to know that not everything is a rocket-ship, and that if you enjoy the project and it’s fun when you can make sacrifices elsewhere (like growing crazy fast). No one wants to sell their soul for money…. or at least they shouldn’t!! Technically speaking the greatest challenge was the debugger. Chrome comes bundled with a remote-debugger that’s incredible, but getting all the other pieces working (like user-submitted scripts, type-ahead, linting, error-handling) is a lot to manage. Overcoming that was a big win for me, as I now solely use that tool for writing any new scripts. ‍  So many mistakes were made. Some that come to mind: Not building an audience earlierNot having a good strategy for content marketingBeing ahead of where the market wasDocumentation was lackingNot sleeping enough I love that there’s a lot of good things too. I definitely shipped early, often, and listened to users a lot. I think this helped bring browserless up to speed on where other cloud-providers are, but wish I would have spent more time on polish and documentation. ‍",,," I’m definitely a build-your-own-solutions type of developer, which I’m trying to un-learn. Time is a more precious commodity than money, and all those other services out there can offer you back time in exchange for money, so trying to learn the difference between building and buying has been a challenge for me. I think another disadvantage is that we’re slightly ahead of the market. Headless Chrome is still relatively new, and developers are still figuring it out, so I think I’m just a tad bit ahead of where others are. This can be good if you’re already established, it just means it’ll be slower to grow. The last one I can think of is that it’s just me for right now :) I can only do so much, and will need to start thinking about hiring others and building out the business in terms of people. I’m actually pretty excited for this as it’ll be totally new to me."," Looking through my git history shows an initial commit back in August of last year! In the end, I wanted the final product to have two forms: a docker image which you could license and run anywhere, and a monthly subscription model where we host all the tech for you. Mike Perham (founder of SideKiq) was a huge inspiration for this model, and I’ve followed in his footsteps quite a bit. With that in mind, I built out the core of the infrastructure into one containable unit (open-sourced here). At its center, it’s just a small web-server that proxies traffic into headless-chrome, but adds some nice features like queueing and a really nice debugger (check it out here!). Once I arrived at this stage I had the help of a few other developers test it out. This part is somewhat crucial as it helped validate the idea before I started to build anything regarding billing and accounts. These early users, whom I met whilst commenting on GitHub issues and helping out in StackOverflow, eventually became the first customers later down the road. It’s hard to say exactly how long all this took, as past mistakes and experience sort of “rolled” up into this final product. Once I had everything in place it took about 2 months to fully build out. I’m a father and a software engineer by day, so finding the time was the real commodity in low-supply. I heavily relied on other vendors like Stripe, DigitalOcean and Sendgrid to get payment, infrastructure and emailing handled, which aren’t core differentiators to what I was doing. As far as tech goes it’s all JavaScript and Redis… and that’s it! Launch day turned out to be sort of anti-climactic. I had a few core users that I mentioned earlier that helped validate the idea, but sites like Hacker News and Product Hunt didn’t really seem to care. Even then, posting it on high-visibility issues and StackOverflow posts got customers trickling in. It wasn’t until I started writing content that I started gaining some traction, with a best Practices post even getting its way up to the front page of Hacker News. Finding customers and knowing where to go next are still things I’m learning and getting up-to-speed on, but it’s starting to take more shape and I’ll definitely be writing more about it.",," Back about a year or so ago, I was trying lots of ideas out to see if I could come up with a side-project to generate some residual income. I had a lot of skill as an engineer, but not a lot of business or marketing sense, so I was trying lots of stuff and was having a hard time gaining traction. Truth be told, the idea originally came from me working on a wish-list app that you could build from multiple providers (think of something like an Amazon List, but across all retailers). Doing this required me to build a scraping-engine so I could get photos, prices and other things that would make the lists more interesting and friendlier. This was all going swimmingly until I ran into Target :) For those that don’t know, Target runs what’s called a single-page app. This means that, when your browser goes to a page on Target, their web-servers don’t return anything interesting in their initial HTML payload. It’s only after the JavaScript runs that anything useful is finally rendered. But therein lies the problem: you had run JavaScript and a whole browser to effectively see what the final page looks like. Having run into that I started to look for something that gave me programmatic access to a headless browser that I could use for my nice new web-app. Spoiler-alert: there weren’t any. This was a refocus event for me, and I switched gears to writing browserless. And since I knew exactly what I wanted, it pretty much built itself (well, aside from the many hours I poured into the project). ‍"," I think I’d not get so caught up in the roller-coaster of running a business. You can literally be on the front-page of Hacker News, and the next day lose your top 3 customers. The market is incredibly volatile, especially in tech, so you’ll need a tough stomach to weather the storm. I’d also tell my former-self to write more than is necessary or comfortable. It makes you spell things out in a different way and challenge your beliefs that you hold, plus it helps you get on another folk’s radar. At the very least you’ll get some notoriety about what you’re doing, and it’ll likely open doors down the road. Plus, you might earn a few customers while doing it. Lastly, I wouldn’t optimize the service for every use-case under the sun. Certain sets of customers just aren’t worth all the time that they can potentially pull out of you. You have to optimize for the best customers out there, which means being open to pivots or changing who you market to. ‍"," I tried all the ones you tend to hear about: posting on big-name sites like Product Hunt and others. For better or worse the user-base for this project is quite a niche, so big audiences tend not to like it as much. What really worked well was posting it on more niche sites like IndieHackers, web-development sub-reedits and (again) GitHub issues! This isn’t scalable, or really a pursuit I’m willing to keep up with, however it got a few users using the product which helped start a positive feedback mechanism and encouraged me to keep working on it. Since then I’ve been trying to keep up on our blog and write about doing common things with headless browsers. These can be as boring as getting Chrome to run properly on Linux, or as cool as how Codepen has used the service for their product. ‍"," You can totally find me hanging out in the following places, and thanks so much again for having me! Browserless TwitterMy personal TwitterBrowserless BlogPuppeteer Slack GroupBrowserless Slack Group"," Podcasts blogs and books! Seriously, just pick one and start doing it habitually! Personally, I need to read more, but when I’m driving, working, or even painting a fence I’m also listening to podcasts. You don’t have to absorb 100% of what’s being said in order for something to sink in and make a material difference. However, at some point, I recommend stopping the noise and getting to work. It can be a little depressing to hear how John quit his job as a crayon-maker, and is now making $75k a month selling C# books for 2nd graders. That’s an outlier and you shouldn’t let it stop you from shipping. The #1 reason I see people fail to make money or get customers is that they haven’t built anything yet.

29,bugfender," Hi there! My name is Jordi Giménez. Once upon a time, I studied computer science in Barcelona which led to jobs in web back-end, web front-end, IT security, and more. More recently, my path has led me to iOS and Android development. I love Barcelona, and I’ve been lucky enough to co-found two companies there, Mobile Jazz and Bugfender. Besides Mobile Jazz and Bugfender, we also run experiments such as Localname, a service to give your local development machine a URL accessible from the Internet and DevCraft, a newsletter for the curious developer. We are testing both and they might or might not become “something” eventually. Bugfender is a tool to help developers debug their mobile applications by collecting the logs of their user’s mobile devices from anywhere in the globe. We get the logs and put them together in a clean interface, where you can filter and view data by user, time frame, mobile device make and model and similar things. Some readers might be familiar with crash reporting tools Bugfender goes one step further by allowing remote access to the logging facilities of users’ devices.  We started the company with only 3 employees, but today we are a team of 9. Bugfender today is installed on more than 9000 apps and running on over 46 million devices. We went from zero to $11,000 monthly recurring revenue (MRR) in 4 years, without any external investment. I do a little bit of everything at the company: from project management, to back-end and iOS development, sales, customer support, setting up online advertisement campaigns, to writing content for our blog. Every day is a little different. As you can see, everything we do is bootstrapped. As founders, we are the only investors our investment is our time, not a ton of cash. This impacts how we run the company: After four years our team is only 9 people, some of them part-time, and we are very careful with our budgets. For example, when setting up an advertisement campaign, our goal is to make a useful product people are willing to pay for. Our ads are sometimes a little confounding to potential customers because nowadays so many things are “free” in the sense they cost no money. But even with these “free” SaaS products, consumers need to know that are still paying in some hidden way, like being targeted with advertisement and having your data sold to the highest bidder. In contrast, we are looking for straightforward customers who value what we offer and are willing to pay for it. Fortunately, there are enough of these people that we are about to reach break-even. We could have already reached break-even if we stopped investing in the company, but we are choosing to keep investing above our revenue, even if this slightly affects our financials for now. We are very open with our numbers, you can check them real-time here. Another fun fact is that the company is totally remote. I am based in Barcelona, but our team is distributed all around Europe. We work remotely and plan retreats or “workations” every now and then. Early on we recognized that meeting together face to face is essential to productivity and team building. Plus, it’s just really fun. ‍",," I already mentioned some of the emotional ups and downs. The biggest challenge so far has been the lack of money. We run everything with our own time and money, and this has become increasingly difficult. During the low times, you can really start to ask yourself, is it worth it to keep going? We’re about to break even, so the investment is paying off slowly—but it is working!  We are now in a kind-of profitable situation, which means that we can pay our expenses, but we cannot afford to pay a salary to ourselves. Still, we do not need to keep putting money in, which is good, but we have to work for free. I hope soon enough we reach the so-called “ramen profitability”, where we can get paid something, even if a little bit, that might not make a big difference but for sure will help in lifting our spirits. We have overcome this limitation for now by splitting our time between Bugfender and consultancy work (for Mobile Jazz). It is not ideal but it is working, though it has been extremely difficult.    On a personal level, I know I am too pessimistic. I have to be careful how I phrase things or how I express my feelings with the team since I could damage their morale. Fortunately, I happened to team up with the right people and we rely on each other’s support when things go out of balance. It has worked very well so far. As a team, I mentioned everyone who works on Bugfender also works on Mobile Jazz, mainly for economic reasons. We maybe could have made the decision to hire someone completely external earlier, who would work full-time on Bugfender. I think the multi-tasking has made us miss some good opportunities.  Also, as a company, I think we have not experimented enough with pricing just yet. We have a pricing based on certain assumptions but we have not tested much. For example, right now we have a free plan which we believe helps people try Bugfender without fear. However, how would changing the free plan for a trial work? We do not know. On the technology side, we have also made mistakes. Working in Go seemed very appealing in the beginning since we were eager to learn about new technologies but Go at that moment was not mature and we have paid the price for it. Also, today we are still finding it difficult to find experienced developers. Something causing problems was the choice of libraries. We chose martini as the web framework and it resulted to be extremely poor performance even its author moved on to a new project called gin. Migrating away from martini to the native HTTP library has improved the performance about 10x for us, saving us (or in the previous months costing us) thousands of dollars, literally. For database access, we used gorm (version 1). But also gorm was mostly rewritten in the following months, resulting in an incompatible API from the version we use it mainly means we should rewrite our code and do a thorough data migration… we are probably going to leave gorm and stick to sqlx, which is a widely used library giving us better control on performance. I guess this is all a reflection of the evolution in the language as the development community matures. We wrote a blog post about Go and the choice of libraries, listing all the pros and cons—maybe it could help other people make better choices next time.  Also, we naturally have had to evolve the primitive MySQL based system. Relational databases are not good at write-heavy workloads such as log storage. We have evolved it into a more complex setup with MySQL only for certain data, then using Kafka and Elasticsearch primarily for storing logs, with some help of Redis for caching the most commonly accessed data.",,," Good question :) It’s very difficult to talk about disadvantages, first because we do not want to see them, second because in my opinion many advantages and disadvantages are two sides of the same coin. So, they define you but they do not determine your fate. Let me explain: It could be argued that being bootstrapped is a weakness, for example. Yet I still think it’s an advantage if we can make the company profitable—and by all odds, we are going to. The lack of abundant resources has made us wise (or helped us “stay hungry” as Steve Jobs would say), and we are capable of running the company with little income each month. So being bootstrapped has made us frugal and that is a great thing! We are unfortunately too used to seeing companies go under because they burnt through all of their funds. Another trait defining Bugfender is it is a paid product. We have a free version for testing, but the “good stuff” is only for paying customers. Again, this is a weakness, because if tomorrow a Google/Facebook/Twitter comes and makes a free version of something similar to Bugfender… we may have a hard time. Again, the disadvantage is very clear, but what’s the advantage? You know the saying “If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer you're the product being sold”? We have a clear understanding of who our customers are and we provide privacy to them. That is something no free product can provide. Also, I mentioned our target market are mobile developers. This means essentially, we work in an ecosystem controlled by Apple and Google. There is certainly a lot of money in it, but the risk of depending on the rule of these two companies is not marginal. I would say this is true for anyone working on an app or on a product for apps. The only solution to this is to keep this risk in mind and diversify as soon as possible. ‍"," Immediately after seeing Aleix’s demo, I talked to him. I remember I was super excited because I had the same problem and wrote the exact same solution 4 years earlier and I wanted to work with him on it. Stefan also liked it, so we agreed the three of us would build a better version and use it as an internal tool for Mobile Jazz. Back then it didn’t even have a name yet, it was just an experiment. We called it “remote logger” because it sends the logs remotely. When Aleix built the very first version, the code added to the mobile applications was a single class we hacked together that sent logs to the server. It was not a proper Software Development Kit (SDK) in any way, just a piece of code that we would copy-paste into the code of individual projects. The server was completely dumb—it just stored anything that was sent to it. Overall, it was probably no more than 200 lines of code.  The first version we built with Go as an experiment (an experiment within an experiment!) which would write the logs in a MySQL database. But, even if crude, it was helping us already! Now if a customer had a problem, we could make a special build of the application with this “remote logger” thing built in. Then it would send the logs over and we could see what was going on. Hooray! We quickly realized it would be better to include the “remote logger” code in all builds of the app and just enable/disable logging remotely when we knew there was a problem with a device. That was the first evolution we did. After that, it kept evolving. Initially, the tool was only born as a way to provide a better service to our consulting clients at Mobile Jazz, but soon enough we saw other app makers were running into the same roadblock. In mobile development, there is always this problem: when a user is experiencing an issue, it’s almost impossible to reproduce, unlike web or desktop. In those technologies, you can always resort to checking the logs on the server or the desktop computer. Not so with mobile.  In mobile, sometimes applications operate without a server, maybe they interact with servers not under your control, or maybe they interact with Bluetooth or Wifi-enabled devices, so you have no way to know what could be happening. Also, yet another problem is the so-called “device fragmentation.” There are so many different mobile phones on the market that you would literally need thousands of them to test your application properly. Even with the exact same setup and conditions, maybe something working for you does not work for someone with a different mobile phone. After 5 months of using Bugfender internally, it was clear to us we were facing a universal problem other companies might be willing to pay for. So, we set out to build Bugfender as a product. First off, we made a website and added a “request an invitation” form to it. In the beginning, we did not charge anything and we had to manually go to the database and create the accounts by hand. We didn’t even have a proper registration form. It was not an annoying task because very few people were requesting access. We tried promoting our tool in developer forums and Twitter, but we got very few responses. However, working with real users helped us. We started receiving the first unbiased feedback, criticism, and feature requests. It took us about 4 months to add in the payment process because we were happy to keep incorporating feedback and make our tool better before starting to charge. We didn’t give much thought to pricing because our goal was to initially find if people were willing to pay something, regardless of how much. So, we went to a competitor’s site and set up our pricing in a similar way. Once we had the payment process ready, it still took us another 6 months to get our first paid user. Those times were a little hard, but we were full of enthusiasm. When the moment arrived, we celebrated. A paid user meant we were not completely stupid, we were building something someone wanted, even if they only paid 19€/month. Once you start charging, things start to get more serious. Shall we incorporate as a company? People started asking questions we need to answer: What is our privacy policy? Our terms of service? Did we encrypt their data? (Of course, we do.) Also, we had lots of doubts along the way: had we found the right “product-market” fit? It was pretty clear to us that money wasn’t just going to pour in. This was a niche product. It really did “scratch an itch” for developers, but we still wondered if Bugfender really addressed a major pain point or not. Could we convince enough people to reach for their credit card and put it in? Incorporating a company, adding metrics in the software to limit the functionality depending on plans, adding the payment and billing process... (OMG if you are someone with influence in the European Union and are reading this, calculating the right VAT for an invoice is ridiculously complex!!!) Did it make sense to put in all this effort, perhaps without getting anything in return... ever? We had some ups and downs in the launching process and in the following months. Getting our first paid user was a moment of celebration. Though it was little money, it provided validation. Another exciting moment was when we applied for an EU grant and were selected from hundreds of applicants. We were awarded 100.000€ for developing our product, meaning we would no longer need to develop out of our own pocket money. I remember I was talking with the other founders about abandoning ship a mere few weeks before that. Something which also encouraged us to keep going was getting direct feedback from our users via chat. The chat had a great impact on adoption because we could talk to potential users and address their concerns. We could help our existing users which increased retention. It was also an invaluable opportunity for us because we could learn directly from the people who were using the product. This helped us build a website that addresses actual user questions.",," I personally started mobile development in 2011. Back then, I was developing my very first mobile application for Android: an app to check the balance of my prepaid SIM card. It was an experiment for me, and I just wanted to learn about Android. My mobile phone operator didn’t have an app and I was annoyed that I had to keep checking their website to make sure my credit didn’t run out. So, I made an app that used “web scraping” to get my balance from the website. (Web scraping makes use of an application to log into a web browser like a real user, click the appropriate buttons to get to the screen with the information you want, and then extract or “scrape” the information for your use.) It worked great for me. Since the operator didn’t have an app, I decided to make it public, in case it was useful to someone else. It turns out it was. Within a few months, it garnered more than 20,000 users, which was a high percentage of the customers that operator had back then. But the problem with web scraping is that unlike humans, applications can get thrown off by routine changes in the phrasing or structure of the information shown. For example, back then my application was being used by both prepaid and contract users, so the website looked slightly different for each kind of user depending on the product—different enough to break my application. To solve this, I decided to make a little web service that my application could send the data to if it turned the content was not what it expected. This way I could see what my application was seeing and fix the potential errors. This was the very first version of Bugfender. But back then it didn’t make any impact on me, it was just a solution I found to a specific problem I was dealing with at the moment. Shortly after that, I met Stefan in a mobile app consulting gig. Together we founded Mobile Jazz, a software consulting agency. At Mobile Jazz, we help our clients work on their ideas and then do all the legwork of specification and design to turn ideas into living web and mobile applications.  Within the context of Mobile Jazz, the idea of Bugfender was reborn in 2015. While working on a client’s project, a colleague, Aleix, had the same problem again. He had a situation where our mobile application was interacting with a server outside of our control and one of our beta testers was complaining the application didn’t work for him. But it worked for us! Since we could not see his phone nor the server, we were left totally in the dark. And again, Aleix came up with the same solution: building a tool to send all the logs to a server. Aleix was so excited with the idea, he hacked it together in a rush over that weekend and proudly showed it to us the next Monday. ‍ Wait. I was shocked. Faced with the same problem, we both had come up with the same solution. This confirmed to me that we were on to something. This had to be something! ‍"," I would hire a marketing person right from the start. We completely underestimated the amount of effort our marketing would require. We thought a couple of ads and a couple of blog posts would be enough to let people know about us. If I had the chance to go back, I would look for someone working on marketing in our space and hire them right away, as soon as money permitted. After some time passes, you can see everything more clearly. Of course, if we knew placing ads didn’t work, we would have spent much less time and money trying to set them up. Finding the right marketing strategy has been particularly time-consuming, but it is a process you need to go through. I wish I spent more time talking to potential customers. After 3 years of operation, I still find people who do not “get” what we do. This does not mean they are dumb, it means I cannot explain it properly (so I am the dumb one). I try to talk a lot with customers and potential customers, but I still think more time would have led to better results. Before starting Bugfender, we also tried another product. It was called “PlayThis” and it was a collaborative playlist to choose the music you play in a party. We had the business plan to make it free or cheap for private parties (e.g. at home) and sell it to bars. We built the product for a few months until we had a working version on the app store. Do you know who went visit the bars during this time? Nobody! Do you know how many copies we sold of the software? None, ever. This taught us a valuable lesson: we need to talk to the customers before building anything. Because I know it is a big learning curve and a common mistake among founders, I want to emphasize: do not write a single line of code until you have someone willing to pay for it. It’s even better if you can get someone to pay in advance (or at least commit to buying). Besides funding your project, this will guarantee it has the necessary bits and pieces and provides a solution (at least to one person). And the contrary is true: it does not matter how amazing your technology or good your idea is. If nobody knows about it, nobody will buy it. Once you talk to your first potential customers, you will realize they might need something completely different from what you had in mind, or what you thought was an unexplored market opportunity, turns out nobody cares. On the technology side, I would have chosen a well-known technology stack from the beginning. It would not have been as much fun, but it would have helped to speed up the project and we would have saved money. We have had to beef up our hardware for a while now because of poorly performing software and that cost us thousands of dollars every month. Also, we are handling a peculiar workload, since we write terabytes of logs every month but at the same time, we have to make them easily available for when a user wants to check them. Striking a good balance in these optimizations is complex, let alone if you are not very comfortable or experienced with the tech stack. ‍"," Our growth has been very organic since the beginning. We knew we could build the product no problem, but we had zero knowledge about marketing. The toughest part has been to reach the right people to let them know about our product. After taking the EU grant we had a mentor (hello Agustín!) who insisted we had to do content marketing. What the heck was that? We did not know much. He had us do an exercise: He asked us to do some keyword research and he provided some guidance. Then we chose the top 20 keywords we thought would have the biggest impact on our growth and we set ourselves to work on those. Our goal was to appear on the first page on Google after 6 months for at least 10 of those keywords. This is easier said than done—improving SEO takes a lot of work! The three founders of Bugfender happened to be engineers. At that moment, that was our entire team. Engineers aren’t super into writing, and this required writing, lots of it. So, it proved a doubly challenging feat for an engineer. But we set to it and we made it. We not only appeared on the first page in many of our keyword searches, but we made it to first place for some. This helped our growth a great deal because for the first time we had a significant amount of organic traffic coming to our site. We also tried other things that did not work. We had other mentors recommending AdWords, Facebook ads, LinkedIn ads, Twitter ads. All of these options made sense to us, so we tried them out. We spent a significant amount of time and money setting everything up and paying bill after bill, testing and pivoting. Though it worked that we got more visitors, we were still spending much more than we made back in new users and, ultimately, purchases. I would say it was worth trying but I would recommend bootstrapped companies try other things first and be very conservative with ad spending. When using ads, you are competing against big companies with huge marketing budgets. I would reserve this strategy for VC-backed companies with a low-barrier for customer acquisition, like free products. We have had a good experience with Facebook retargeting. We show ads to people who have expressed some interest in Bugfender by visiting our website at some point. This has been a much more successful strategy, since we are targeting individuals, instead of big groups, with a much higher chance to turn them into customers. We also thought our customers would be so excited to use Bugfender that they would share it. We built a whole referral system with promo codes and invitations, similar to the strategy Dropbox uses and is well known for. We were wrong, people had better things to do. They were happy using our product but talking their friends into using it was a different thing. We also tried participating in social networks: Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, but we found they are already too full of marketing messages. Having a meaningful interaction is extremely time-consuming and in the end, everyone is trying the same tricks, so it is very difficult to stand out in the crowd. We have recently found, though, being more active on Twitter helped us, probably because developers hang out more on Twitter, so we are doubling our efforts there while reducing the activity in other networks. We also tried A/B testing for improving our website content. Even if in theory it sounds good, you need many thousands of visitors to your website in order to extract meaningful results. And often those tests are inconclusive just because there is not much difference between the things you tried, or the impact in your conversion rate is so tiny it does not matter, so we have found them not very useful for our case  So, for now, we know content marketing is our hobby horse and we keep working on it. But we have not stopped trying new things and we will keep trying we will never stop, probably, since times change and companies change. Maybe some things we tried in the past might eventually work in the future. ‍"," You should definitely check Bugfender’s website.

I love reading, so I would recommend The Mom Test. It is a short and sweet book which helped me a lot in the “talking to customers” department. I think every entrepreneur should read it before starting anything. Also, the Start Small, Stay Small book, The Lean Startup book and the Signal v. Noise blog talk about bootstrapping i.e. building the project with your own time and money and seeking no or very little help from investors. Now, not every project can be built this way, but a lot of people do not know much about this alternative to VC funding, so I would recommend learning a bit about it and seeing what is most suitable to your idea. I like the Smart Passive Income podcast in order to get ideas, most of them bootstrapped too. It is a format that gives me a lot of energy. The Rework podcast is a nice collection of stories from different entrepreneurs to learn a lot about entrepreneurship. I also regularly hangout in the Indie Hackers and Hacker News forums. On marketing, I also had to learn a lot because I had zero knowledge about this when I started.

30,bunnyshell," Aloha! I’m Alin Dobra (29) and I’m the CEO & Founder of Bunnyshell, a SaaS startup for applications that really need near 100% availability and reliability. I have more than 10 years of experience in building big projects and I love to automate things. I am very passionate about everything about technology, marketing, sales, and psychology. I started working in software engineering in 2011, became the CTO and then CIO of a conversion marketing company and decided to build my own cloud tools once I realized the product I needed didn’t exist. So I created Bunnyshell, with a seductive proposition: set up your servers across different cloud platforms in just a few clicks. Automate, launch, and provision, deploy, monitor, scale, and stay secure. No time wasted, no specialized and expensive sysadmins required, no testing needed, no hidden costs. No headaches, just cloud. We launched Bunnyshell in March 2018, got a €750K investment in under 18 months, and today we provide services to corporate clients all over the world. ",," It’s not easy to build a startup when you're married, have a 1-year-old, a family to think of and debts to pay :) But luckily, I had some resources in my bank account which allowed me not to focus on the money, but on the journey ahead. The biggest challenge we faced was when Roxana, my co-founder, was hit by a car and needed a few months to recover (she’s doing great now, in perfect shape). This was the trigger to go out to find sources of investment.  6 months later we got €750K in our bank accounts for our first seed round, led by Early Game Ventures. ‍  I think we should have launched the product even faster. We were slow about taking some bold actions. We wanted to build a product for everyone and we were so happy that people listened to us and gave their feedback that we forgot to ask ourselves a question: Is this feedback relevant for us, for what we are building? ‍ What’s the real use case? Is it a relevant opinion? Feedback is great, but if you listen to the wrong advice, it can end up killing your startup. Or you’ll build something that you don’t want to build. Create a company neither for yourself nor for your customers. And then you yourself will kill your startup. ",," We’re working on creating a sysadmin robot for every server. We call it the Site Reliability Robot (SRR).  What we really want to do is automate all the sysadmin and DevOps tasks and, through that, to help build a new Internet. A better, safer, and faster one. That’s why we introduced features like auto-healing servers or continuous fine-tuning to maximize server performance. We have plans to grow, to raise new funding, to scale, to become a standard in the industry. I think that’s what all startups strive towards, right? But it all depends on our results. Our focus in the near future is to find our product-market fit. To build a product that people want, need, and love. And to enjoy the ride and help those around us. It’s part of our pledge to help companies whose IT infrastructures have been challenged by the coronavirus crisis. For all the SMEs that have been economically affected by the virus and for the Medical, NGO’s and Educational companies that are active in finding a solution to the COVID-19 virus, we plan on helping their recovery and growth with free cloud migration.  Life is too short to build something mediocre. On a personal level, I want to spend time with my wife and 3-year-old son, playing chess and enjoy life.",," I made my exit from the previous startup and got together with Roxana, my DevOps at the time (who has become my amazing co-founder and whom I’d like to thank for being part of this journey). Together, we started building the DevOps platform of our dreams. While we were working hard at building the MVP, we were also trying to sell it to customers (a sell-it-while-you-build-it strategy). It was very important to us to validate the idea, make sure we weren’t creating something that nobody wanted or needed. Plus, bootstrapping, developing on the customer's money is always better. I really enjoyed the process of getting started, it was challenging for me and it was (and still is) a journey about self-discovery. I wanted (and still want) to do so many things (outreach, social selling, quizzes, infographics, conferences, workshops, content, academy, etc.) but we’re only so many people.  We’ve learned a lot and we’ve listened even more. This entire process has confirmed that patience is the key that brought us here.  I love beginnings because they’re full of ideas, optimism, motivation, and trust. I’ve always thought that it’s about the journey, not the destination. The road itself teaches you the lessons. ‍",," When I was 23, I was promoted to CTO at an outsourcing development company, a Magento & Symfony partner, and I had to manage the relationship with customers and a team of over 30 people. Basically, I was a child with a lot of responsibilities.  I didn’t know what my attributes were, so I started reading about it. What it really meant to be a first-time CTO. And from this research, I found something very interesting and valuable. Something truly WOW that guided me in the next few years: “The CTO should have a plan for everything. For everything that happens wrong, it’s his fault.”  So I started to learn and do whatever it took to make things happen: recruitment, HR, retention, sales, account management, development, sysadmin, DevOps, etc. In the next few years, I learned and tested a lot of things in real-life, and I kept following the same motto: that I needed a plan (which sometimes involved plans A, B & C) for everything. It’s this attitude that helped me become a Managing Partner at that great company.  After I worked out how to create teams and build software, I found myself wanting more. I wanted to build products, to find solutions for real use cases and problems, to make a contribution to the rest of the world.  So I left the company and joined a startup in the marketing space, a product designed for eCommerce, which improved conversion rates through A/B testing, personalizations, and popups. This was also the first time I’d ever heard of anything related to A/B testing, user personas, conversion rates, micro conversions, funnels, and a lot more terms and acronyms widely used in the marketing industry. It was a challenge that I wanted and was ready for.  Once the business started growing, it also became challenging from a technical perspective: more than 200k requests/minute, more than $15K/month at AWS. So I reached out to Microsoft and we became a part of their startup program, which landed us some credits (some, as in more than $100K - so thank you, Microsoft!)  We only needed to migrate our infrastructure from AWS to Azure to start saving $15K/month. So I started looking for a way of doing this that would allow us to operate our infrastructure after the migration in the same way as we did in AWS.  And I was very intrigued to find that this type of platform didn’t exist.  Since I wasn’t having any luck and because I really didn’t like having to depend on other people (remember - I was the guy with the plans) and I love automation, I created the tools internally. From provisioning to deployment, monitoring, and alerting. We successfully migrated from AWS to Azure and created our tools to manage the infrastructure - but this migration took 4 months!  You could call this my A-ha moment: when I realized that this type of tool needed to be created. A platform that took care of the exact same things every app needs, everything sysops related: provisioning, monitoring, alerting, backups, autoscaling, etc.  Who doesn't need backup or security or uptime? We all want the benefits of automation - not to automate again and again and again. Why reinvent the wheel over and over again?"," I would think in use cases. Not features. Not benefits. Use cases.  What are the use cases that you really solve? How can you solve them better than anyone? The biggest mistake most startups make is that we (myself included) think that we need more features to bring more customers. Wrong. Completely wrong.  You don’t need to go after all customers at the same time. Find a use case. Go after it. Validate it. Get the first customer. Get the first 10 customers on the same use case. Get the next 100 customers, and then go from there. ‍"," We took distribution very seriously, right from the beginning. Even if we did not have a specialized department when we started, we tried to use the power of word of mouth.  We started talking about Bunnyshell and our plans to anyone who would listen: our friends, our ex-colleagues, everyone from the IT community with whom we've ever interacted. Asking our network about their network helped us a lot. We created partnerships with cloud providers like Microsoft and DigitalOcean and that really helped us with the trust factor that we needed to show to our customers. When you’re talking about your production, you’re talking about your business. So it’s very important to find a trustworthy partner.  When we launched the Bunnyshell Beta version, we went back to all the people we'd talked to and gave them the opportunity of testing the platform. We received lots of feedback and found that the IT community is generally happy to help.  Then we started to go to conferences, talk about Bunnyshell, and about our mission to democratize the Cloud. That, alongside social media, has been a good place to start.  We started to see traction from the beginning and we’ve had some pretty big, important clients that showed trust in us even though the platform was in its early stages. Our first clients were a pharma company, then an eCommerce platform, then an eCommerce store. They helped us with feedback and we improved day-by-day.  It’s been almost 2 years since we started Bunnyshell. It might not seem like a lot, but it was a very intense period for all of us, with all the feedback and changes and strategies adopted to find the perfect market fit.  We’re now testing 4 different strategies to grow our customer base: 2 strategies for marketing, 2 for sales. The first phase was to validate the idea, the second phase to validate the product. Now we are working to find out our product-market-fit.  Even if, in the beginning, it seemed hard to define and redefine the product after getting feedback, it helped a lot. We can now look at the platform and say that we’re proud of what we've done there. So, my piece of advice for anyone that wants to start a business: nothing is possible without listening to your customers' feedback and improving your product to cover their needs. You build the product for them, not for you.  This is a very tough lesson for entrepreneurs. You build your entire company not for yourself, but for your customer. If you cover their needs - then they will give you their money and attention. ‍"," The Bunnyshell website, our blog, and Medium posts. "," Read books: “Start with Why” by Simon Sinek“The Lean Startup” by Eric Ries“How to win Friends & Influence People” by Dale Carnegie“Zero to One” by Peter Thiel I made a list of books that helped me to better understand the business, marketing, and everything that involves a company. For me it was very useful, I found lots of answers to my questions. I remember that this list was one of the first posts on the Bunnyshell Facebook page.  Read articles on growth hacking stories like: The Hotjar Stories - Part 1 & Part 2How Intercom Succeeded You can learn from everywhere, but the most important thing I think is to know how to filter the information. I tried all the time to learn from verified and popular sources. You can learn from tutorials, podcasts, you can learn from Youtube. We are lucky to have so much information at our feet and we should take advantage of all the benefits that technology brings. I actually have my “personal” bookmarks with this type of resource.

31,busymind," I'm a Front-end Web Developer and have been in the industry for over 10 years now.  I've traditionally made a living working a regular full-time salary job, however over the past year I've been transitioning to contract work while I build a side business. Currently, I'm finishing up an online video course on WebdriverIO, which is a framework for web automation tests. The course is almost 50 videos long and has taken me over a year to put together. It's been my most successful project to date, but not my first. I've worked on many different projects over the years, with many attempts to have some success with them. One of them is a mobile app that didn't quite take off like I would have hoped. ‍"," The biggest issue I faced was slow growth and an inability to commit time to the project. I was able to build the app out in a month, but after that, I had a hard time dedicated time to it. Other priorities took over and I put the app on auto-pilot to see if it would become anything. Aside from about 5 purchases a month, not much has happened. I don't think this was a problem with the market or the idea, just that I didn't dedicate the time to it that it would need to really grow. This is why I think it's so important to build your savings, even if you don't have any immediate plans on going into the business.  To me, having savings available that you can lean on for several months is invaluable in freeing up the time needed to get something to take off. Without it, you're really limited on your options.  "," I didn't trust that it could work. I was too afraid that I'd spend all of my time on the app and building an audience, but nothing would come of it. Because of this, I stopped working on it all together and ""gave up"" on the idea. I'm not saying that if I stuck with it it was a guaranteed success, but there's been an ongoing interest in the app and I've received some really positive app reviews. I think had I kept on working on it, it may not have been a financial success, but would have still been a worthy effort. ‍",,," Time and the lack of it. Not just for working on the app, but also for marketing through more blog posts, videos and building an audience. With the family and job commitments, I just wasn't able to dedicate the time it deserved.",," I tried finding users for the app by posting to blog posts on meditation and emailing bloggers and anyone I thought would be interested. I have BusyMind App available which allows you to go through almost the exact experience of the app without registration or purchase. It's kind of an 'unlimited free trial' of the product. I think that's useful for folks who want to see what the app is about. I also reached out to friends and family, and would mention it to anyone I thought might be interested. I also wrote up a couple of blog posts on meditation and how tricky it can be, mostly as a thought experiment and to get things off my mind. Those were helpful in driving a little bit of traffic to the app."," As a parent of two young children, my days are full to the brim with excitement. I had been learning about mindfulness meditation at the time, but couldn't find a spare moment to really practice it. Every app and site I found, required sound that would always bring my toddler over to see what I was up to. Not very conducive to meditation.  I had the idea to build an app that would be geared towards mindfulness meditation outside of the traditional ""find a quiet spot"" methods.  BusyMind is a simple app that I built out over a month or so that serves this purpose. It guides you through basic breathing and observation exercises to help bring your mind back under control. It's entirely silent and can be done in a crowded room without drawing strange looks. ‍"," Focus less on the income and more on the audience. I was so put off by the limited earnings potential that I never gave it my best effort. I treated that app more like an experiment, mostly because I was afraid to commit to it more than that. ‍  Focus on building your audience first. That doesn't mean you can't charge for your services, but don't expect the money that comes in at first to be significant. I think the point of charging at first is to validate that folks will pay for the idea.

32,buttercloth," Hey everyone! I’m Danh, founder of Buttercloth. I’m 45, was born in Vietnam and I’m currently living in Carson, California. Our headquarters were originally based in Long Beach, California, but we grew so fast that we had to move to Carson. I grew up working in my family’s small tailor shop. When I was ten, I started making my own clothes and dreaming of coming to America to become a fashion designer. When my family immigrated here in 1994, I took fashion classes at a local college and landed a job at Mattel - designing clothes for Barbie. When I saved enough money, I enrolled in my dream school, Otis, and after graduating was recruited by 7 for All Mankind. I later was Head Designer at House of Howe (Union Bay), and then Affliction Clothing for 10 years. When I came up with the idea to create my own brand of luxury dress shirts, I quit my job and cashed in my 401K to start the company. Today, I am living the dream with Buttercloth, a clothing brand selling comfortable shirts. We’re currently selling everything throughout our eCommerce. We’re mainly focused on the US audience, though we plan to expand globally in the upcoming years. ",," I struggled first with the courage to leave my comfortable job and salary. It's easy to stay in a job where you are comfortable, content, and have a steady salary coming in, so gaining the confidence to take that leap and follow my dreams was a really difficult thing to do, especially having doubts and measuring success. There are challenges every day, and I see them as opportunities to make a difference. I love it. If I never would have taken that jump from my job to entrepreneurship, I'm not sure if I ever would have. Taking the risk is initially the hardest thing to do, but if something scares you enough, that means you're doing something right. ‍  Honestly I don’t see any disadvantages – I am truly blessed to have the advantages I have. And mistakes? I make them every day, just like all of us. The important thing is to recognize them quickly, and fix them quickly.  When we started scaling, I was convinced that we could trust our logistics to a third party. After only two months, I realized this was not going to work for us. I flew to Indiana and personally supervised the transfer of our goods back to California where we could control it and guarantee the customer experience I want. The customer is always right, and a true, honest experience for the customer can make or break a sale. This is something Buttercloth is passionate about, giving our customers the most memorable e-commerce experience we can. ‍",," Following our signature button downs, we introduced polos and sweaters last year, and we will have jackets available in the fall. In addition to the new categories, I’d like to begin distribution in select retailers in 2021. I expect Buttercloth to become a household brand within 5 years. We are constantly adding in new styles, colors and listening and engaging with our audience on what they'd like to see and how we can evolve as a company. In 2019, we made $6M in sales and we plan to double or triple that figure. Since we’re expanding to new products and trying out new things, profit margins will be around 7%-12% this year. All this was made possible with a team of 16 people working within the company. ‍",," Since the beginning, I knew I wanted to focus on eCommerce. But there was an issue, I knew almost nothing about digital marketing. That’s how I began looking for a digital marketing partner. I interviewed a lot of digital marketing agencies until I found one that stuck out the most. Luckily, the owners saw the shirt and felt in love with it so we became partners. Soon after, I received a call from them saying that Metta World Peace, a really famous basketball player, had just tried Buttercloth’s shirts and felt in love with them. They explained to me that it could be super beneficial to reach other celebrities and get our name out there. When I met Metta, he described to me the same issue around shirts that I had at the moment of starting Buttercloth and told me he had never used such a comfortable shirt before. He also told me he really wanted to become a partner right at that moment, he became an ambassador of the brand. Metta World Peace was greatly responsible for the success of the company. For the first months, Buttercloth was nothing, but then we began working with him, launched and we got around $700k in sales. So I had a great marketing partner and a well-known celebrity ambassador, so I thought to myself: “what’s missing?” Funding. That’s how I decided to audit for Shark Tank. My mentor helped us get in the line and do it well throughout the audition. Getting featured in the show was a mix of hard work and luck. We had 5-6 audits in different forms, then we had to wait 6 months and then we were told we were accepted and that we were filming the pitch and negotiation. However, the live feature in the program didn’t come until many months later and in all that time, we didn’t know if we were actually going to be featured or not. Luckily, we got aired on October 28, 2018. We had prepared ourselves really well, completely filling our stocks. Despite that, we got out of stock super fast, and that two more times. For the following months to Shark Tank, we did $3M in sales. It also brings a bump in sales every time the episode is aired. At the same time, we were able to land a deal with Robert Herjavec for $250,000 who, to this day, is helping grow the Buttercloth brand worldwide. He was a perfect fit as he really represented us as a company and found our shirts really helpful. Robert and his team have been invaluable to building Buttercloth. Even more important than the capital has been their coaching and access to their networks of the best partners is every area of the business. ",," When I started in fashion, I was very lucky to meet a lady that designed for a company called Mattel, the Barbie toy manufacturer. I think she saw some talent in me and she suggested going to work with her. I began working part time and it was an amazing opportunity. I was able to design clothes for Barbie and learn a lot through the 5 years I stayed in the company. After that, I was recruited by 7 for All Mankind, where I worked for 2 years, and then moved to Hause of Howe by Union Bay, where I worked for another 2 years. Affliction Clothing came later. I was hired as Head Designer and worked there for more than 10 years. While working for Affliction, I began thinking about something: I hated wearing dress shirts. “They’re stiff, they’re scratchy, and you can’t move in them!”. I would wear a t-shirt to the office and change out into a dress shirt just for meetings. One day I thought, “why can’t I make a dress shirt that feels like I’m wearing a t-shirt?” That was my “aha moment.” At the time I left Affliction Clothing, I had around 20 years of experience in the industry. I really wanted to start my own comfortable shirt brand but it was a difficult process which took me 2 years to decide to fully get into. I had a really comfortable and well-paid job so quitting it to focus on my own business was scary. One day, one of my mentors gave me a book from Steve Harvey called Jump, which talked to me about my life and my future. That’s when I decided to leave my job and focus on my own venture. I decided to go 100% on it and even sold my house to fulfill my dream. I travelled to China and worked with mills to develop what eventually became Buttercloth. I already had a relationship with different factories from my previous jobs, so I told them about my product and asked them if they would be interested in creating it. Three of the people I contacted denied as they thought it wasn’t possible to create such a product, but then one accepted. However, they warned me that to set up everything it would cost $3k and then $20k to get the first production. I decided to go with it. Using a special blend of 100% long fiber cotton and a unique manufacturing process, we developed a profoundly soft fabric I named “Buttercloth.” It had incredible breathability, 6-way stretch and an exclusive double finished construction. "," I may have started a little sooner if I would have had the courage, and yet the timing has been perfect. Timing is everything and you can't think too much about the what-if's in life. I can honestly say that I wouldn't change a thing about my story and how things ended up. There is always something you could have done differently, but then you never learn. I try not to look much into the rear-view mirror – the windshield has a much better view ahead. :) ‍"," We began by advertising on Facebook and Instagram, using videos to tell our story and educate consumers about the brand and what makes it unique. Metta and Robert have been great brand ambassadors helping represent the brand and bring awareness, so that has helped grow the Buttercloth audience and gotten us a foot in the door in the menswear fashion space. Slowly, we have added additional channels that today include Google, YouTube, eMail, SMS, and affiliate marketing. ‍", Where else? Buttercloth.com!," I like listening to podcasts, while I’m driving, working out at the gym, or just having some down time. A couple of my favorites are “How I Built This” with Guy Raz, and “Enterleadership” by the Dave Ramsey organization. It's an easy way to emerge yourself into the industry you want to get into, and what better way to learn than from real people's stories and the mistakes + successes they made that you can learn from, Another great resource has been the Small Business Association.

33,cam-ly," Hi, I’m Dane Jensen. I’m 34 and I’ve been in Austin Texas for the last 11 years. I run a startup here in the custom merch space Sock Club Custom Socks. We’ve been a D2C brand for over ten years and built our American supply chain designing and manufacturing custom socks. Cam.ly made wifi cameras that would stream and store video in the cloud. I founded the company along with my friend Rhett Creighton. Our product was very similar to dropcam.com which eventually became Google Nest Cams. ‍"," In the end, the business shut down because we failed to build a polished product in a short time and convince investors that we were worth betting on. I think we should have had a plan for how we were going to raise our next round. We were pretty green and just tried to go to the market. But I think with the type of product we were building we should have instead built the product to raise money. I think our competitors were more well connected and had raised more money. Our competitors had worked at top tech companies including Microsoft and Apple and successful startups like Xobni which meant they knew a lot of people with cash to invest.   The main cause of our failure was that we didn’t build a polished product. We built something that worked for us (as hackers). We could easily set up the product but for a layman to set up our product it was a hassle. When famous electronic critics reviewed our product they wouldn’t even write reviews because the product “just wasn’t consumer-friendly enough yet.” We built everything ourselves. From the web servers to host the video to the firmware on the cameras and we were running on little Angel funding. I think we should have thought more about what we needed to prove to investors to get that next round of funding to give us a runway to make a more polished product. We were trying to go from zero to a consumer-ready product all without much funding. It was also our first time trying to raise money. I remember getting an email from Paul Graham in our YC rejection email saying something like “you seem like good hackers but your product doesn’t seem good enough yet” which seems about right.",,,,, We raised an Angel round from friends and family. We spent maybe 5 months building the product. We bought off-the-shelf hardware from China (IP cameras). Made some changes to the firmware and built our web video hosting service that connected to the cameras in Rails.  The product was pretty technically difficult. We had lots of obstacles designing a good consumer experience.   We launched on Reddit and hacker news. Did some fun marketing stunts like building a pinata busting machine that we streamed using our service. We reached out to very popular critics of electronics and gave them our product to try out for free. ," Listed above posting on internet channels, marketing stunts and giving our product to critics. I think the marketing stunts worked the best. If our product were more polished I think giving it to popular critics would have been more successful. ‍", I have a degree in Mathematics from Brown University. I’m a web software developer. Cam.ly was one of the first jobs I had after college. Cam.ly was my business partner Rhett’s idea. He had built a few internet startups at that point. He is a true entrepreneur at heart and has since been building cryptocurrency startups. Rhett and I tried a business finding and matching great software developers with software companies. Two products got some traction jobpoacher.com and githire.com. Job Poacher was a simple form that said what you currently did and what you were looking for and had an anonymous email feature like craigslist. Git Hire read your GitHub profile and ranked you and reached out to top performers to see if they wanted jobs. , I would have told him you need to either focus on making this a product that your mom can use or the other path to success is to prove to a VC or other investor that you're a good bet and spend all your time raising money and not on the product.  Don’t split your time between product and fundraising.  Make the plan to make a good product and then go fundraise or make a great product and go to market. I wish I had more determination to raise money.  I think we had a good team and good sense for what made a good business we just needed a runway to get product-market fit.  ,,," Shoe Dog - if you want to go far, focus on building a team.Everything YCombinator puts out - That community just has a very rational approach to business and cuts through the BS and figures out how to build something people want.Derek Sivers blog - Importance of customer service and execution.Creativity Inc - We went through a tough period last Fall/Winter of exponential growth that we weren’t necessarily prepared for.

34,campertunity," My co-founder: “Let’s make a website to help people get outside. A website where people who own land can list their land and campers can book it. It will make us millions of dollars!” Me: “Oh yeah! Good idea!” A few months later…. My co-founder: “We made $36.87 this month.” Me: “We are on our way to making millions!” ‍ Be realistic, optimistic, and know that the law of attraction actually exists! What I know for sure is that it’s never too late to start a business, and I’m not just saying that because I’m 39 and optimistic. Based out of Vancouver BC, I have a love for the mountains and water. It’s always a privilege to breath fresh air and drink clean water.  My education is admittedly a little nerdy, as I have a degree in chemical and environmental engineering with a master in occupational hygiene. So, it’s my determination to succeed and I work hard, but, most importantly, it’s my love for nature and helping people that led me to create Campertunity.  What’s Campertunity? It’s an online peer-to-peer marketplace where users can book a campsite on private land. Basically, I introduced camping to the shared economy in Canada. Now, I’m happy to be the co-founder and to welcome landowners nationwide and campers worldwide to list their land or book a campsite on Campertunity.  As a co-founder, my role is big and all-encompassing. I handle everything from marketing to website maintenance to making sure our receipts are in order for tax time. It’s a big job to start a business and an even bigger one to maintain it. But, I love the freedom and excitement associated with creating my own project.  Who is our target audience? Campers and landowners. Landowners are anyone with outdoor space that’s big enough to pitch a tent, and campers are anyone who likes sleeping under the stars for either one night or 365 nights a year (that includes glampers). So, please sign up with Campertunity for easy campsite bookings on amazing private properties nationwide.  And, amazing properties is an understatement. We have campsite hosts who offer yoga classes, fresh Canadian bacon for breakfast, horseback riding and tours of their farm. Have you ever seen a fainting goat or a sheep being sheared? Now’s your chance. Wheelchair accessible farms are also available because getting people outside means everyone. ‍ As we just reach our one year anniversary since Campertunity’s launch, I’m proud to say that we are growing every day, and am confident that Campertunity will be a name that’s synonymous with camping.  ",," The biggest challenge I faced was taking that first step to introduce Campertunity to the world. When the website was finished and ready to be launched, we were standing in the kitchen of my small Vancouver condo and sweating just before hitting the “launch” button. Then, I did it. I hit launch...then waited.  Before Campertunity launched, we had media attention. So much of it that we were in the newspaper and on the radio before Campertunity even had one user signed up. So, by the time launch day arrived, we had 250 people who had signed up on our landing page. Here we are, thinking that by pressing the launch button, hundreds of people are going to list their land and Campertunity is going to make thousands in its first year.  As you can maybe imagine, that wasn’t the case at all. The launch button was pressed, 3 people listed their land, and the website was almost stagnant for another 6 months. Camping season was over.    Our greatest disadvantage is that camping is seasonal, meaning Campertunity is a seasonal business. We are busy all year round with marketing but the interest just isn’t there in the middle of December. That’s simply a reality we have to face in Canada.  Our second disadvantage is that we don’t know how to code. Although people smarts are a great quality to have, growing up in the 80’s didn’t have any advantage in learning how to code. With many tech start-ups being created by people in their early 20’s who have nothing to lose and all the knowledge of a computer, it’s hard to keep up with maintaining our own website and tweaking it to suit the appearance and functionality that we want.  And, my mistake: I wish we had started small and then grown bigger. It would have been easier and we could have gathered more attention if we focused first on British Columbia, my home province, and then expanded as we became more popular and with more revenue. But, we started big...all of Canada, and marketing to the second largest country in the world is a lot of work that’s overwhelming. We can’t reverse what we did because we already have a few listings and users across Canada, but we may shift our marketing back to BC and grow more at home.  ",," Our goal is to have 1,000 users and a 100 listings by the end of 2019. In the 5 year term, we want Campertunity to generate $100,000 per year. These are just our numbers.  More importantly, we want to be that number one option for campers and to finally fix the current problem of there not being enough campsites. We want people to experience the fun of camping on a farm and meeting people from all over the world. This is the real experience of Canadians welcoming nature lovers to their neck of the woods.  To achieve our financial, and non-financial goals, we need more staff. Even now, with two founders working on Campertunity, it’s overwhelming. We imagine boosting the economy through bookings but also by employing Canadians.   Lastly, Campertunity is all about nature and I envision partnering with the provinces and territories in Canada to help keep decrease the effects of climate change. At this time, I don’t know the details of what that partnership looks like, but I will stand by my values to ensure a clean future.  ",," The coding for Campertunity was outsourced. They say that if you’re building a tech company, it’s best to have a co-founder who is a coder, but my co-founder and I have a computer literacy of close to zero. We decided to still go ahead with Campertunity because outsourcing the coding was do-able for us and because being sociable with people-person abilities will take a business farther. If you check-out the Campertunity website then you’ll see how much we’ve been in the media.  It took 2 years to build Campertunity, with a hickup at the beginning when we hired a friend to do the coding: a guy who constantly said, “Yeah, I can do build Campertunity, no problem.” When, in fact, he took thousands of dollars from us and produced nothing. We could have decided to give up but we thought that because we’ve already spent this much money already (even though we had nothing to show for it!), we need to keep going.  On our second time around, we chose our web developers very carefully. We did interviews, fully explained what we wanted, signed a contract with them that we revised a few times, and had them follow a project charter that we designed. In the end, it was a pleasure to work with the professionalism of Bread and Butter Inc., based out of Victoria, BC, who completed the project on time. In the end, even they seemed surprised that they built Campertunity, such a complex website.   Campertunity is bootstrapped. With no investors, no crowd-funding, and no asking mom for money, I did this on my own as I’d like to keep Campertunity as a project that I can control, for now. Down the road, as we may need more money, we will consider the options out there.  Campertunity will be a huge success but we have one setback: insurance. It will cost $50,000 a year to have insurance in which we can welcome landowners to be a part of. At the moment, if someone wants to list their land, they need to get extra insurance in case a camper breaks a leg or a neck, and not all insurance companies are willing to take the risk. Canada is a cautious country and it’s shown by how our shared economy develops a few steps behind the United States. Even an Uber or a Lyft can’t be found in Vancouver.  ",," As background, in July 2016, while camping with friends in Pemberton, BC, I asked, “Where are we? I mean, who owns this property that we are camping on?” A friend replied, “See that house over there? This is their private property.” That same summer, Nora, co-founder of Campertunity, and I went camping in a provincial park. This time, our space was much smaller, our camping neighbours a few feet away, and our morning disturbed by RVs driving by. An experience many campers can resonate with.  We see the headlines every year: too many campers and far too few campsites. The mad-rush to book your summer camping trip in the winter and the expensive re-sale of campsites is a barrier to enjoying the peacefulness of nature.  Our camping experiences, combined with the current stressfulness of booking a campsite, and the need for a solution led to Campertunity becoming a reality. The shared economy is growing in every way, from sharing our homes to our cars, so it’s a good time for camping to enter the shared economy. The public appreciates having options and power, which is what Campertunity provides.  Get people outside, build community, and sustain land are Campertunity’s goals.  ‍ As mentioned, I’m an Engineer, which may seem odd for someone who creates a camping website. But, for me, it makes perfect sense because after working for so many years and watching climate change destroy our earth, I understand the importance of maintaining mental and physical health. I believe one of the best ways to do that is to get outside. This is my major motivator in building Campertunity let’s help each other and our environment.  Before Campertunity, and even during, I maintain the title of Health and Safety Director. I’ve studied and worked in various countries around the world, so I get the importance of having motivation. Thankfully, my Campertunity co-founding partner has a background in tourism and customer service. So, the two of us together make a pretty great match.  When some people reach a certain age, maybe in their 30’s, 40’s or later, they gain a freedom where they are less likely to care about what other people think and more likely to put their fears aside. There’s a serenity that comes with being secure with ourselves. With the ability to put any fears aside, I was able to jump into creating Campertunity with the thought that if this business fails, at least I can say, with pride, that I tried. That alone is hugely worth being proud of.  Campertunity is my first jump into a business but not my first risk in life. I’ve traveled the world for work and invested in real estate I even took a risk and had a baby. I’m thankful to have had many successes, and a huge part of it has to do with attitude. What we think is what we manifest. Regardless of past failures or successes, know what you want and believe you will achieve it. "," I would have been more careful on who we hired as a web developer, considering we got burned with the first developer we used.  Also, rules in British Columbia state that a business needs to have a business licence. That’s simple, but I didn’t get a business licence right away, thinking that an online marketplace business doesn’t need a licence. I eventually got one but the time lost cost me because I wasn’t able to apply for provincial grants for education without a business licence.  When we started Campertunity, we set everything up perfectly: we had our P.O. Box ready to go, our Zendesk, Sendgrid, and whatever add on needed to help run Campertunity. But, some of them weren’t needed and after the first year, we are realizing that we don’t need a P.O. Box anymore, or even some of the helper apps we pay for. So, we are able to cut costs by understanding that it’s okay to start small and add on what we need as we grow.  "," Facebook and the media are our best friends for marketing.  At first, we were doing paid advertising on Facebook and boosting our posts here and there. But, after simply posting about Campertunity to various camping group pages, we found that we were not only getting the attention of the public, but of journalists.  Soon, we were being interviewed for TV, radio, podcast, newsprint and online media, and it hasn’t stopped exploding. Our media attention is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and with every article or broadcast about us, we gather a few dozen new users and listings. This is where our people skills come in handy because giving an interview, either on paper, phone or in-person, takes practice and a persona.  ‍ Paid advertising hasn’t been an option for us because our budget has been blown to build Campertunity, so not much can be said on that. But, with all the media attention I’m gratefully receiving (for free!), I don’t know why I would bother with paid advertising.  What about our revenue? The Campertunity website is maintained thanks to the 10% profit that is taken from each booking. With no annual fees and no cost to sign up, our motto to landowners is, “We don’t make money unless you make money.” With just over 400 users and 50 listings, with more joining Campertunity every day, we are thrilled to have some of our first bookings this summer and will continue to grow our revenue.  "," You can check our blog posts on our website. You can also find us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.  A Google search of Campertunity will pop-up our numerous media appearances. Here are a few."," In 2018, I had the awesome experience of being a part of YC Start-Up School. From that experience, I learned that there’s a whole community of entrepreneurs out there who are not only creative geniuses, but also incredibly helpful. From YC, I was introduced to their Y Combinator podcasts, which is the first of my recommendations for new entrepreneurs. Through these podcasts, you can hear advice from the best of the best.  Second, for those who are in British Columbia, Canada, I recommend hitting-up Small Business BC. These folks are not only face-to-face assistance in helping you answer all your questions regarding your start-up, but they offer seminars (often free!) on everything from how to incorporate your business to how to market it on social media. They are pretty amazing and always friendly.  Lastly, I’m a big fan of motivational books because, as Napoleon Hill would say, “Dreams are the seedlings of reality.” Keep believing this and your business will get to wherever you imagine it to be. So, all this to say, Napoleon Hill’s “Think and Grow Rich” is a favorite book. Otherwise, if you’re wanting an easy read from a “rags to riches” fellow, pick up any book by Joe Girard. This guy writes simply, interestingly, and motivationally.  ‍",,Travel,,Canada,"May 21, 2019",Nora Lozano,https://www.failory.com/interview/campertunity,"['https://campertunity.com/', 'https://www.facebook.com/Campertunity/', 'https://www.instagram.com/campertunity/?hl=en', 'https://twitter.com/campertunity1?lang=bn', 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/business-sharing-economy-camping-1.5057159', 'https://www.straight.com/life/1093801/north-vancouver-duo-launches-airbnb-camping-across-canada', 'https://omny.fm/shows/steele-drex/talking-to-the-co-founder-of-campertunity-the-airb', 'https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=1416068']",success,1,$0-$10k/mo,"Nora is the co-founder of Campertunity, the first business to introduce camping to the shared economy in Canada.

35,canary," Hi! My name is Nick and I’m a 24 year old entrepreneur from Boston. My two passions are helping people and building cool things, and that’s exactly what I get to do with my startup Canary where we’re changing the way venues book live music. I recently quit my $130,000 job to pursue Canary full time. Canary is a mobile app where venues and musicians are booking their gigs. Everything we are doing is because we believe in connecting the music scene. We believe that venues and musicians should focus on what matters to them, and that booking live music should be easy. The way we enable our users to do that is by creating a beautifully designed app that’s simple to use. As a venue, you can find new talent to hire and handle all communication and scheduling with minimal effort. As a musician, you can browse gig opportunities and create a profile to show off your brand to the venues who browse the app. As a co-founder and CEO, it’s my job to strategize how we’re going to grow and be successful. I’m also a software engineer, so I’m always updating the app with new features for our users. My co-founder is Josh McAloon and he leads our venue acquisition. We also signed on Tom Hamilton from Aerosmith as an advisor. That’s a huge win for us since he brings a ton of experience and industry knowledge. ‍",," Raising money is one of the hardest and longest processes so far. We’re raising $150,000 and started fundraising in September of 2018. There is also additional pressure since Canary is not yet making enough money for Josh and me to pay ourselves. For me, I have no other income, so I’m currently eating through my savings to be able to do this full time. Once we close this round, I’ll feel a huge weight lifted off my shoulders since I’ll be able to have some income, regardless of how small. The biggest advantage of raising money is that it buys us time to operate for the next 12-14 months. In terms of actually finding investors and raising money, that presents another problem. How do you meet investors? For me, I met most of our investors through Shapr. Shapr is basically Tinder for networking. Whether you’re looking to meet investors, find an engineer, or just network with people in your area, Shapr will help. Another challenge I have personally faced, which I alluded to earlier, is dealing with rejection. I have never been trained in sales and have had no prior experience before Canary. You can imagine the wake-up call I had when the first dozen venues told me they weren’t interested. It was hard in the beginning, but I’m learning to have thicker skin. There’s no easy way to get comfortable with rejection, but being able to adjust my expectations is something that’s eased that pain. ‍  I made a few technical mistakes early on in developing the app. Although building a web app is great, it was done incorrectly. I didn’t create a codebase with reusable code and so trying to update it was a nightmare. I also should have used React but instead used mostly PHP and jQuery. That just meant that, even if I wanted to do something simple, I had to write a lot of code to get it done. With React, and now with Swift/Kotlin, you can get so much more done with a small amount of code. We haven’t made all the right moves in how we approach selling, but we also didn’t have any experience in selling something like this. I wouldn’t call them mistakes, but there was just a learning curve that took a few months to figure out. There was no easy way to figure out how to sell, it was just being aware of how we were doing and constantly improving it. ‍",,," The biggest disadvantage is bar owners reluctance to change. It takes multiple meetings with bar owners before they are comfortable enough to try Canary and trust us. One way to combat this problem is to offer financial incentives for venues. For example, giving a venue $1,000 in booking credit on Canary makes them more confident. Once we close our fundraising round, we will have the financial flexibility to offer incentives like this. ‍"," The MVP was a web app built in HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript and SQL. For those not familiar with programming, a web app is basically a website that runs on a phone, whether that’s on iOS or Android, Safari or Chrome. It took me a few months to build that out since I was still learning how to code and make everything work together. Since I was working my 9-5 job at Wayfair, I only had time to work on the app after work. For a few months, my schedule was work 9-5, come home, workout and shower until 6, spend thirty minutes eating dinner, then work on Canary until 11 PM or 12 AM. It was exhausting, but it was also so rewarding to see the progress. Whenever I would run into problems, I would Google my way to success. In technology, and coding in general, there’s a very high chance that if you’re running into a problem, someone else has had it as well. Being able to use websites like Stack Overflow was a huge advantage since I was still learning. Wayfair also had a very big impact on teaching me to code. I brought myself as far as I could on my own, but with Wayfair, I was able to bring it to the next level. There were a few times that I thought I wouldn’t be able to figure out a problem, but thankfully Wayfair taught me that you can always overcome any technical challenge. After a few months, I was able to submit the app to the app store. Check out the picture below to see how Canary has evolved (and is still evolving every day). The current version is a native app, so I had to learn how to use Apple’s Swift programming language. The best teacher out there is Brian Voong from Let’s Build That App. You can see him teach for free on YouTube or buy a class and support him on his website. I watch all his videos on YouTube and took his Instagram class from his website, where he teaches you how to build Instagram. Without him, this version of Canary wouldn’t exist. The iOS app took me a month to build. For building the native Android version, we hired a team in India. I posted a job on Upwork explaining the details of the job and what our budget was. I interviewed a dozen engineers and then picked the firm we have been working with. Instead of me learning to build a native Android app from scratch with Kotlin and spending a few months doing that, we spent $3,500 to have the overseas team copy our iOS exactly. I checked in with them once a week via Skype to see demos of the app and provide feedback/guidance. That experience has gone very well. We’re now working on a seperate web app where our venues can log in to their dashboard and manage everything from their computer (or from our mobile app if they want). Venue owners tend to be older and have a firm grasp on navigating computers more so than apps, so we think the addition of the web app will reduce any friction. This web app is built using React and our existing Firebase and NodeJS backend. ‍",," I’ve always loved to create and fix things. It started early on when I was 16. I would fix cracked iPhone screens in my area and ended up fixing over one hundred phones. I profited a few thousand dollars from that and fell in love with entrepreneurship. I had a few other ventures when I went to college at Bryant University, including the Charging Chair, a beach chair that charges your smartphone (pictured below) and DirtByMail (acquired a website where you can anonymously send a bag of dirt to a dirtbag). Those ventures were really great because I learned different aspects of the business manufacturing for the Charging Chair and legal issues with DirtByMail. Throughout college, I fell in love with technology. So much so that I taught myself how to code. It served me well because I ended up getting a job as a software engineer at Wayfair in Boston. While I was there, a good friend and bar manager, Ryan Dolan, mentioned the struggles of booking live music. We talked through the idea and decided it would be a fun project to work on. I was especially keen on joining since I wanted to expand my engineering skills to some real world projects. Our goal was to make an app that would allow the bar manager to send out gig invites. I built an MVP early in 2018 (which was very ugly) and we iterated on that. Ryan and I actually won a local startup competition for Canary in Worcester, MA where we won free office space for a year. You can see us (me on the left, Ryan on the right) proudly repping our Canary swag and standing in front of our first office. As Canary continued to grow and as things were becoming more serious, Ryan decided he didn’t want to leave his day job to pursue Canary full time. He actually decided to pull out of the project completely, which is when I went looking for another co-founder and found Josh.", I wouldn’t change much. All the mistakes we have made so far has made us a better team and has made Canary a better product. ‍," To be honest, we’re still figuring out what works best. Currently, my co-founder and I go out and visit venues. Once we’re there, we ask to speak to whoever is in charge of booking live music, which is usually the bar manager. We ask about their current way of booking live music and then show them what Canary can do. Most bar managers are looking for an easier way to book live music, so it becomes one of those things that’s an easy decision. In the beginning, using Canary wasn’t an easy decision for them. The main reason was that our technology didn’t have all the features that they needed. Canary is now very flexible and we’ve made the onboarding process for venues, which was the biggest bottleneck, super easy. Initially, I would call venues and try to sell them Canary over the phone. Once I was speaking with the live music booker, I would just start selling to them by explaining all the features we have and why it will save them time. That failed miserably. It’s so easy for someone to say they are not interested on the phone and hang up. I actually got quite discouraged in the beginning since I was getting rejected so much. Once we changed up tactics from phone to in person, we had more successes. It felt amazing to get users on and actually start booking gigs. We are also changing up how we sell in person. If you listen to Simon Sinek speak about how leaders inspire action, you’ll learn that people buy why you’re selling, not what you’re selling. It’s more important to talk about what you believe instead of a list of features. Here’s the difference: “What we’re selling” approach: We made an app to makes booking live music easier. You can find new talent to book, book your existing musicians in a few taps, and handle communication and scheduling all in the app. Want to try it? “Why we’re selling” approach: Everything we do, we believe in connecting the music scene in Boston. We believe that you should focus on what matters to you, and that booking live music should be easy. The way we do that is by creating a beautifully designed app that’s simple to use. As a venue, you can find new talent to hire, book your existing talent with a few taps, and handle all communication and scheduling with minimal effort. Want to try it? See the difference? The second approach has more emotion behind it and is easier to buy into. It’s just a more powerful pitch. For getting musicians on, we just asked ourselves: Where are musicians hanging out online? They are mostly on Facebook posting their music and Craiglist trying to find new gigs. We post there with the “why we’re selling” approach and just change a few words around to make it apply to the musician. Musicians are pretty receptive to it, especially since it’s free for them and they only have upside."," Check out Canary’s website and let me know what you think. Reach out on LinkedIn and say hello!

36,career-sidekick," Hi, Biron here. I’m a 34-year-old entrepreneur from Boston, USA. I’ve been traveling for the past few years while growing my online business at the same time. My business is a job search advice website called Career Sidekick. We earn revenue from a mix of products (a course and e-books), affiliate marketing, and display advertising. As founder and owner, I’m responsible for strategic decision-making and the overall profit/loss of the business. I’m also our PR person, for now, so I am responsible for getting press coverage, getting more exposure, etc. Finally, I’m involved in the content planning and creation process for our web content, even as we’ve grown to a multiple-six-figure business. While this wouldn’t be optimal for a founder/CEO in many businesses, we’re primarily a content website, so our web content is vital to our success. And since we publish a relatively low volume of content (one to four articles per month), with a focus on high-quality, evergreen content that will be relevant for years to come, I feel justified in spending some of my time ensuring our content remains excellent. ‍",," The biggest obstacle I overcame was uncertainty and doubt. I came very close to giving up and selling Career Sidekick multiple times, for a shockingly low amount (I was earning very little from it for years, and the sale price would have surely been below $10,000). Now, as my site competes with much larger businesses (some with 50-200 employees) to get attention and search traffic, I’m facing new obstacles, but I’ll have to return in a few years to describe how that turned out :) The biggest mistakes I’ve made: Trying to do everything myself for too long instead of hiring help and trusting others. I think because the nature of my business is so scalable, it allowed me to get away with doing everything myself for a very long time. I would have been forced to delegate tasks much sooner in another business model like a service business (marketing agency, content writing agency, etc). However, the business began growing faster once I overcame this mental block and trusted others to help with the operations. This is a transition that’s in progress and that I still need to improve upon. This also allows me to play to my strengths. I’m not very detail-oriented, for example, so I’ve hired an editor and proofreader so that I never have to read any content before it gets published. That’s a huge help and frees me to do higher-impact tasks. Also, at the very beginning, I was far too hesitant to spend money and invest in the business. I learned that trying to save a few hundred dollars (on website software, marketing tools, etc.) often costs you far more in the long-run. My business is still highly profitable… 80%+ profit margin… just because of the nature of the business. But I always look for ways to invest and buy the best tools/resources for myself. It’s worth it. ‍",," Each of the past four years has been a record year for Career Sidekick in terms of revenue and profit. We’re a multiple six-figure per year business now and profit margins are 85%+. I’m still the only full-time employee I hire contractors/freelancers rather than bringing in full-time staff. The company is 100% remote/distributed, too. We don’t have an office that anyone on the team works from. The goal for the next 12 months is to double our annual revenue. I’d like to see profit margin dip, believe it or not, because that would indicate that I’m doing less of the work myself and hiring people to do more! I think that’d be fantastic for long-term growth. Expenses are very low right now, at less than $4,000 per month, and I think we could grow more by increasing that figure. I also hope to delegate more of my tasks, in areas like content writing, content planning, and PR, to free my time for bigger ideas and initiatives which I’m hoping can eventually grow the business 10X or more. But to do that, I need to spend less time working in the business, and more time working on the business. I think that’s key for any leader. My goal is also to enjoy my non-work life more. I’m going to end each workday at 2 pm, while getting more done, thanks to better prioritization and more delegation. I’m excited about this change because I think it’ll bring tremendous business growth as well as personal growth.",," Very quickly, without much thought (for better or worse). I decided I wanted to build a career advice site, so I spent a couple of days researching a domain name, then I bought it on NameCheap. From there, I paid for web hosting, installed WordPress, and got to work. The slowest part of this process was picking a brand/domain name. And I feel this is where the most time should have been spent, since it cannot be changed easily and has a big impact on whether people can remember the site, type it easily, etc. I’m not claiming I’ve got the best domain name ever, but for a .com name that was available on the open market, I’m happy with how things turned out. The first version looked very basic and used a free WordPress theme. And I paid $5 for the logo on Fiverr. But I started, and that’s half the battle! You can see how old some of the initial posts are, dating back to 2013. As mentioned earlier, I founded the project and then let it sit semi-dormant (one new article per month) for a few years before I figured out how to grow it. Over the years, the site has gone through many iterations and gradual improvements. We’ve changed the WordPress theme multiple times, improved website navigation based on user feedback and viewing user heatmaps (using Hotjar), and more.",," Before Career Sidekick, I was working as a recruiter in Boston. That’s how I learned the job search tips that I share on the website, and that was the original premise of the site: Practical advice from an executive recruiter. However, the website didn’t grow or succeed initially and eventually took a back seat to other projects for a couple of years. During this time, I continued working as a recruiter and eventually quit, moved to Thailand temporarily, and began working as a freelance digital marketer. My dream was always to succeed with a web business and leave freelancing behind, though. However, I made many mistakes that stopped Career Sidekick from growing initially. One mistake was beginning too broad and not choosing a narrow enough niche. The saying, “niches make riches” is true in my experience. The website was originally a career advice blog where I wrote about all sorts of topics, from why it’s unfair for employers to require a two-week notice, to how to succeed while working for multiple bosses. I had two big problems here in terms of the content marketing strategy: First, it was too scattered. I was writing about all sorts of different things, so nobody had a reason to pay attention or follow me for any of those topics. Second, I was writing content that I felt like writing, instead of writing about topics that my audience was searching for help with online! This seems so basic and simple now, yet I see many blogs (both personal and corporate) making this same mistake. If you want to succeed with SEO and blogging, you need to research what people are searching online and write posts that directly address the information that people want help with. I only started seeing success when I recognized these errors and niched down into just job search advice, and began writing content that directly answered my audience’s questions. ‍"," Niches make riches. You’re not limiting yourself by choosing a well-defined niche for your business. You’re often limiting yourself by trying to appeal to everyone and starting too broad. If you try to appeal to everyone, you’ll appeal to no one. Even Amazon began by just selling books.Collaborate with competitors. There’s room for more than one business to succeed in a niche. You can befriend a few like-minded founders in your niche, help each other, and all benefit. Abundance mindset!Who you know matters, a lot. Build relationships whenever possible, and look to help others first. Asking for favors upfront isn’t networking!Consistency is key. I didn’t do anything particularly quickly, but I kept making progress and chipping away. I had slow months but I kept moving forward. As long as you’re inching closer to your goal, that’s okay.Don’t reinvent the wheel. For most business challenges, someone else has already solved it (and written about it/talked about it). You don’t need to try to tackle every problem on your own, from scratch. Use templates for things like sales pages and marketing emails, search Google for problems you’re facing, etc. Hire help. It’s okay to take inspiration from other businesses, too (just don’t plagiarize).Never stop learning. Every time I’ve thought I knew everything about a topic, I discovered how much more I had to learn. Stay humble and keep learning. Or else one of your competitors who’s doing that will pass you! "," We’ve always been focused on organic marketing. Organic search is our biggest traffic source. Of our 1,000,000+ monthly visitors, more than 80% come from search. Here is the general trend of our monthly pageviews from 2015 to the Present: Quora has also been fantastic for us, and the answers I’ve written years ago continue to bring in views and website clicks. I haven’t written answers on Quora for approximately two years, yet you can still see steady views on my content: Pinterest has been surprisingly good, too, especially if you set your website images to have a “Pin” button that invites people to pin the image when they hover their mouse. That’s one of my favorite, easy-to-implement tricks because it gets other people sharing your website for you. LinkedIn has also been excellent since Career Sidekick is in a business-related niche. I’ve found LinkedIn to be a “blue ocean” with less competition and more opportunities than other big social platforms like Facebook and Instagram. There are just fewer high-caliber marketers with great tactics on LinkedIn, meaning it's easier to stand out and build a following. I wrote about this for Social Media Examiner and revealed some of the ways I grew to 200,000+ followers while being named a LinkedIn Top Voice in 2019. LinkedIn has become a bit more competitive this past year, but it’s still easier than most of the other big social sites. LinkedIn was also incredibly valuable in terms of building connections and relationships with industry peers. These relationships got me article features (from other blogs, but also big news sites and journalists), podcast appearances, partnership opportunities, and more. I think LinkedIn was our most valuable marketing channel, aside from organic search/SEO, because of the direct traffic it drove and the relationships and opportunities it opened for me as a founder. If I could only do two things to promote my site, it’d be SEO and LinkedIn. In terms of revenue, we’ve slowly rolled out e-books on various topics as the site has grown, and then developed a job search video course after that. We looked at what topics were doing best on the blog and wrote books around those topics. This seemed logical for two reasons. First, we know the topics are popular and relevant to people in general. Second, we already have traffic coming to our site looking for help with these exact areas, so we know we’ve got “warm” leads. We’re not big on launches, unlike many online info businesses. We usually just do a quiet launch where we work these products into our email sequences, set the product to be offered as an up-sell or down-sell after other purchases if relevant, etc. We’ve never done a big, attention-grabbing launch. That may be a missed opportunity that I can look into in the future. Beyond our products, we’ve also started capitalizing on affiliate partnerships and display ads through Mediavine (they’re a fantastic ad network and I can’t recommend them enough). For affiliate partnerships, we’ve been able to refer visitors to career coaches, resume writers, online coding bootcamps, e-learning platforms like Skillshare and LinkedIn Learning, and many other services that can help job seekers beyond what we offer. However, we focused on traffic and growth first. We didn’t monetize for the first few years. And even now, people often come to our homepage and are unsure how we earn money at first glance. I like that! Here is what the site’s homepage looks like now: ‍"," My business is Career Sidekick and you can connect with me on Instagram and LinkedIn, too."," Favorite tools: WordPress for building a scalable websiteActive Campaign for email marketingAhrefs for SEO researchCanva for designs and graphicsSendowl for selling digital downloadsTeachable for selling a coursePaypal and Stripe for payment processing Favorite blogs to learn from: Authority Hacker (great podcast, too)BacklinkoAhrefs Blog (and YouTube channel)Diggity Marketing‍ Books that inspired and taught me: The Millionaire FastlaneFour Hour WorkweekThe Power of HabitThe Irresistible OfferScientific AdvertisingThe Ultimate Sales Letter ",,Education,,United States,"March 9, 2021",Biron Clark,https://www.failory.com/interview/career-sidekick,"['https://careersidekick.com/', 'https://www.instagram.com/bironclark/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/biron/']",success,1,$25k-$100k/mo,"Biron has been traveling for the past few years while growing Career Sidekick, a job search advice website.

37,chowdy," Hi! My name is Steve and I’m a 28-year-old entrepreneur from Toronto, Canada. Though at the moment I’m “digital nomad”-ing in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Before I jumped headfirst into the world of entrepreneurship at 24, I was a management consultant at Oliver Wyman. I co-founded Chowdy with a childhood friend and ex-housemate in order to solve the problem we both personally had, which was that we were spending way too much money eating out. To solve that, Chowdy offered subscription-based prepared meals plans to Toronto’s young professionals at a flat $7.99 per meal, with plans ranging from 6 meals per week to 14 meals per week.  In terms of how we divided up responsibilities, I was in charge of operations, technology, and finance while my partner was responsible for customer service, marketing, and outreach. In reality, we both did whatever was needed.  We had some success with this setup for a while. We grew Chowdy to $1.3M in annual revenue in 2 years, a team of 8 staff, and successfully pitched on CBC’s Dragon’s Den (though we turned down the funding offer). A big reason for the success was an innovation we created that no other prepared meal companies were doing: we didn’t deliver. Rather, we had our customers pick up their meals from one of our partner cafes in downtown Toronto. These “hubs”, as we called it, were independent local cafes at prime downtown locations the cafes would provide both the space for the fridge and the staff to track customer pickups. In return, we paid them a relatively small fee of $500-$800 per month, plus all the foot traffic from our customer base. The reason this model worked so well was that it solved one of the biggest problems meal delivery companies face: the extremely high cost of last-mile delivery. It allowed us to cut distribution cost per meal to less than $1, compared to $5-$8 for a typical meal delivery company (which, by the way, is why none of them are profitable). The hub system allowed us to scale up very quickly. Looking back at the 2.5 years we ran Chowdy, its eventual failure was the confluence of many factors from unsustainable business model to cobbled-together operations, but the straw the broke camel’s back was regulatory (and ironically, related to our hub system). This experience was ultimately very educational for me from both the successes we had and the causes of its end, and I’m applying a lot of what I learned to the project I’m currently working on - The Travel Brief - which is a crowdsourced travel guide to off-the-beaten-path destinations around the world. While these two businesses are so different, I think a lot of tactics are the same, like how to acquire customers, how to improve visibility, how to find a sustainable model, and how to deal with the emotional rollercoaster as a founder. While we’re still on the very early stages of The Travel Brief, having just launched it 3 months ago, we’re already seeing some promising growth and at the moment we have ~200 users (~100 monthly active), 2000 monthly views, and 20-30 new pieces of content generated by our users every week, and most metrics are trending positively.  ‍"," If marketing was the rocket fuel for Chowdy that allowed us to grow 10-20% every week the first 2 years, we crashed because this rocket just wasn’t built to last. Looking back, there were a number of fundamental issues that we never quite figured out. First, our margins were extremely slim. We had this idealistic vision that since we didn’t have the real estate and seating area overhead that restaurants have, we can charge a low price and still get good margins. I modeled everything out and things looked great in Excel. But costs always turned out higher than planned and were always increasing (inflation). But because we fixed our price as part of our core brand message, we were always struggling to make enough money. If there were any hiccups in the process, we would lose a lot of money. The second problem was high customer churn. The average lifetime of a subscriber was 9 weeks, with almost half quitting after the first week. Once they quit, it was also extremely unlikely for them to come back (we tried to entice them back with discounts but less than 1% of them came back). This wasn’t a burning issue for us because we were still small and the untapped market was large, but it cast doubt on the long-term sustainability of the business. The third issue was that our business model wasn’t scalable. Our model relied on having 3rd party hubs, and the hubs all had to possess certain characteristics: independently-owned and beverage-only. There was only a limited number of them, getting them on board was not a repeatable process, and most critically, they were not very stable. For example, we had one hub go out of business because their landlord sold the entire complex to a condo developer. This event was extremely disruptive for our operations, as we had to find another hub in the same neighborhood to replace it in a very short timeframe, and having any downtime meant losing tons of hard-earned customers. While these three issues were something that we had to overcome sooner or later, they didn’t stop us from growing. The thing that led us to shut down Chowdy turned out to be regulation. Basically, the Toronto health department did not approve of our distribution model. They looked at how we were storing our meals at 3rd party hubs - who did not own these meals - for anywhere between 8 hours to 36 hours, they deemed the process too risky and lacking sufficient oversight. In August 2016, with a single report, they ordered us to shut down our pickup business. They were fine with our suburban delivery business, but that made up less than 20% of our volume and there was simply no growth potential in that because we had no cost advantage compared to the myriad of other food delivery businesses in Toronto, some of which were very well funded (like UberEATS). After they ordered us to shut down the pickup business, we tried to switch our customers over to delivery, but almost no one converted since we charged an $8 delivery fee (the breakeven delivery cost). Additionally, most of the pickup customers actually prefer the pickup system, because it gave them the flexibility to get the meals whenever they want, instead of having to wait for the delivery driver to show up. We went back and forth with the city for about 1 month, during which time we lost pretty much all the money we made in 2015 and 2016 because we kept most of our staff on payroll and still had to pay rent on the production facility. We also had to write off about $10,000 worth of ingredients that we purchased but could not use when the city ordered us to shut down the pickup business. Eventually, we just couldn’t figure out a way to compete in delivery and get back the volume we lost. And because we had essentially no retained earnings to keep the business going, and no outside investors, we simply did not have the resources to keep it going any longer. The shutdown process wasn’t very orderly. Because the city had ordered us to stop the pickup business abruptly, we couldn’t even give 80% of our customers proper notice. It was literally an email a day before the scheduled pickup date telling them they couldn’t pick up their meals anymore. Predictably this led to a lot of angry emails and cancellations. Over the following month, while we were negotiating with the city, we kept our staff but cut back on their hours to try to save money and attempted to salvage any pickup customers to delivery instead. When it became obvious that this won’t work, we gave the head chef 2 weeks notice, everyone else was let go immediately. We informed the landlord, with whom we had a 2-year lease but she ended up not pursuing us for it (because I personally helped her find another tenant). Every piece of equipment we owned was written off.  The entire month felt like an out-of-body experience, like I was watching someone else perform these tasks. Chowdy became such a normal part of my life by that and it was hard imagining what life would be like without it. But I was also relieved, to be honest. I was pretty much constantly stressed the two and half years we ran Chowdy and all of sudden I wasn’t, it was a big weight off my shoulder. It helped that we didn’t take on any debt building the business."," I think the single biggest mistake we made from which we did not recover was the “Uber mentality”, which was growth at all cost and ignore any regulations. In building up our food production and distribution process, we should have consulted with the health department early on. We should have paid a private consultant to come in and do an audit for us. Early warning on this would have provided us with ample time to try different distribution models and adjust accordingly. Instead, we were hit with an abrupt shutdown order and as the result could not muster any resources in the short term to make operational changes.  But we didn’t consult anyone. Because we were inspired by Uber and Airbnb to just ignore the regulators. On top of this, there were a bunch of other mistakes in hindsight which, although did not directly cause Chowdy’s demise, all contributed to it: Our pricing was way too low. So low that we basically made no profit over the 2 and half years we ran Chowdy. So low that we didn’t have any resources in reserve to help us deal with unexpected emergencies. Not getting funding. This again relates to the question of resource. When the health department issue came up, we literally had no money to deal with it. If we had outside funding this may have turned out differently. Not having contingency plans for a lot of situations. It wasn’t just the health department issue - we were constantly going from one emergency to another. I barely devoted any time on growing the business after the 2nd year because there were so figurative fires I had to put out, from water getting cut off in our facility, to hub shutting down, to employees walking out.  No risk management. I never sat down and analyzed what were the major risk areas our business faced, partly because I spent all my time in the weeds of running the operations and handling the emergencies. In retrospect, there were so many parts of our business that were very fragile and would break at the slightest disruption. The health department issue that led us to shut down was really just a manifestation of this. ‍ In terms of the challenges we faced along the way but eventually overcome, there were so many. I’ll give 3 examples: The first challenge was ingredient sourcing. We started with buying ingredients ourselves from local supermarkets. We would rent a car on production days, drive to cheap Chinese supermarkets, and buy 1-2 shopping carts worth of ingredients. After about 3 months our volume became way too big for us to shop for ourselves. Additionally, I realized we were not taking advantage of our volume to get discounts on the ingredients. That’s when someone explained to me how restaurants get their ingredients from national distributors like Sysco and GFS. With that, I reached out to a bunch of these suppliers through their websites. Initially, I didn’t get any response back. I then called them directly and was able to meet with some of their reps to figure out how we can buy ingredients from them. The next problem was the facility. We were using our cook’s home kitchen in the beginning. But very quickly that became unfeasible as we learned that it’s illegal to use home kitchen for commercially sold food. Also, home kitchens are simply not equipped with all the specialized and expensive equipment that commercial restaurants use for volume production (like a convection oven and tilt skillet). So we looked around for any commercial kitchens we can rent for cheap. At one point we had the idea to partner up with nightclubs, which are all legally required to have commercial kitchens but they rarely use them. We were able to get a couple of nightclubs to agree to let us use their kitchens for cheap, but this turned out to be a big mistake as we found out that these kitchens were woefully under-equipped and not very clean (we had 2 hires walk out on us because of it). Eventually, we found a newly-started hourly rental kitchen that was clean and had everything we needed. We stayed there for 2 years until we eventually took over a restaurants space and converted it to a dedicated kitchen space. The biggest problem, though, was staff. I learned pretty quickly that the type of people I was hiring was so different from the corporate type I used to work with at the consulting firm. In the food industry, every one job hops every few months and it was extremely tough to retain good and reliable people. We offered above-market hourly wages, yet we were not able to keep anyone for longer than a few weeks. And because our production team was so small, losing even a single person caused significant disruptions for us. There were so many days when my partner and I had to personally jump in to help with dishwashing and deliveries because we were so short staffed. This problem never fully went away, but we eventually grew to a scale that we were able to have a full-time head chef, who basically managed all the hiring for us. ‍",,,," Piece by piece, and continuously.  Within 2 weeks of discussing the initial idea, we agreed on the basic business model, the key marketing message, and the price. My partner and I both believed in the agile approaches to startup, so we never spent too much time trying to figure out the “right” answer. We agreed to just try everything we could and see what sticks. We initially wanted to do a revenue-sharing model with cooks who would get compensated by how many meals they made. But when we pitched it to our first cook (who was a friend of my business partner’s), we basically learned that there was zero appetite for something like. People in the food industry have a very traditional mindset and they wanted guaranteed hourly rate. Once the cook was onboard, we got 20 of our friends to partake in a 1-month trial at $5.99 a meal. 2 weeks later, the cook was making the first ever batch of Chowdy meals at his home kitchen. Over the course of following one year period, we one by one put together most of the key foundations of Chowdy: First was the kitchen, we learned that we couldn’t use a home kitchen for commercially sold food. So, we went out and found an hourly-rental commercial kitchen.  Next, we couldn’t use our apartment for distribution anymore because the volume was growing and strangers started to use the service, so we conjured up this “hub” idea, cold-called a bunch of cafes to pitch them, and was able to get one of them to give it a try. As the volume kept growing, we couldn’t keep using email and Google Spreadsheet for order management anymore because my partner was spending an ungodly amount of time on these admin tasks. So I built a web app that automated all order-taking and order management tasks with Ruby on Rails.  Shortly after that, we could not personally do all the ingredient shopping anymore because the volume was too large for the two of us to handle. So we learned how restaurants get their ingredients from national distributors like Sysco and GFS, so we went out and signed up with one of these distributors. So on and so on. I’m describing all these milestones in a linear way, but there was a LOT of running in circles and setbacks along the way. I remember how on the Christmas of the year we started, we got a Cease and Desist letter from a lawyer representing this company called Fuel Foods because they thought our name was too similar to them (we were called FuelBite at the time). We panicked because neither of us knew how to deal with it and we were scared of getting sued. So we “lawyered up” but was actually advised to change our name. My partner at 3am in the morning came up with “Chowdy”, and that’s what we were called ever since. I think the main thing I’m trying to say here is that we never stopped building Chowdy over the course of 2.5 years. There were always new initiatives we were trying out. Most of them fizzled out but the ones that did work allowed us to achieve what we did.",," I’ve always known that I want to be my own boss at some point. By 2014, I started to seriously think about starting something, anything. I was getting antsy because I knew that it’d take me multiple years and attempts to build something successful, so I needed to get started ASAP. It seems silly in hindsight, but I wanted to “make it” by the age of 30. So, I quit my job as soon as I got my bonus that year. I didn’t have any business ideas when I quit, but I figured quitting the job would give me the motivation and time figure it out. The idea for Chowdy came about in a random conversation I had with my housemate and soon-to-be business partner complaining about how food was so expensive in Toronto. Since neither of us knew how to cook we should just hire a chef to make our food for us. I applied my consulting modeling skills and quickly realized that it’d be too expensive to cook for just the two of us. Then we wondered what if we could have a chef make food for 10-20 of our friends, and for multiple days at a time. With that, we decided to just try it out. My partner knew a cook personally. We pitched the idea to him and he loved it. We messaged 30 friends we thought might be interested and got 20 of them to agree to try it for a month. 2 weeks later we made our first batch of meals. After the trial period of 1 month, we were pleasantly surprised to find that most of our friends wanted us to keep going. We did and opened it up to the public, and that’s how Chowdy came into being. By the way, we weren’t called Chowdy in the beginning. We thought our target demographic was the fitness/gym crowd, so we called ourselves “FuelBite”. As I’ll explain below, we were forced to change our name a few months in and we came up with “Chowdy”. Full credit goes to my partner for this name, which he came up at 3am in the morning after we thought off and tossed out what felt like 1000 ideas. We both loved it instantly because it sounded food-related, friendly, and gender-neutral (it was important for us to not sound either too masculine or feminine). ‍"," Honestly, I probably would avoid food business! There have been so many food startups over the years, including some that raised tens of millions of dollars, but most of them went out of business (SpoonRocket, Sprig, Maple) or drastically shrunk in size (Munchery). There are very little barriers to entry in this space so price is ultimately what everyone competes on. At the same time, consumers have no loyalty to food brands they will happily try a bunch and switch to another service if they can get a better deal. But if I have to do Chowdy again, I would try to raise money as soon as we hit $1M in annual revenue. At this point, it becomes relatively easy to raise money, and with the money I would hire a team to manage all the day-to-day operations so I can focus on the big picture specifically, growth, risk assessment, and contingency planning. Related to this but a much more significant strategic change I would make is to find a strategic partner and/or acquirer as early as we could. I was starting to toy with this idea in my head by the time we had to shut down but I never got around to implementing it. The idea is to partner up with a large company that can get a lot of synergy (I know I hate this word too) from our business model. I was specifically thinking about grocery chains. I think grocery stores would’ve loved to partner with us because we could help them acquire a fast-growing segment of the market that they don’t already own: people who don’t cook. This arrangement would solve our distribution problem once and for all because grocery chains already have a large and stable real estate network. I’m not quite sure if this would solve our regulatory issue, but I have a hunch that if our distribution partners were large grocery chains instead of mom-and-pop cafes, the health department would’ve treated it very differently. In fact, a year after we shut down, I read about a meal kit startup in Montreal being acquired by Metro, one of the largest grocery chains in Canada. It’s obviously too late at that point, but it made me regret that we didn’t reach out to one of them sooner. ‍"," Marketing was one of those areas in which we tried a lot of different tactics. Eventually, it solidified to four main marketing strategies, which generated almost all of our customers. First and foremost was Facebook advertising. I never used Facebook advertising before Chowdy and I was skeptical of how effective it would be. But within days of setting it up, it was generating a steady flow of sign-ups. The acquisition cost was also very low, averaging no more than a few dollars per conversion, making this channel extremely critical to our growth. I would say Facebook ads gave us around 50% of our customers over the lifetime of Chowdy. We tried advertising on other platforms, notably Google Adwords and LinkedIn, but they were not very effective for us and we gave up on them after a while. The second most important strategy was customer referral. We copied what Uber did and gave each customer a referral code, and gave both the referrer and referral $10 off their purchase. This accounted for around 25% of the customers. Even though it was a very expensive marketing channel at $20 per acquisition, we felt we had to do it simply because it has become such a standard practice. The third strategy was Search Engine Optimization. Through various efforts (many of which were frankly accidental, like getting featured on a national newspaper), we eventually ranked within the top 3 Google results for “Toronto meal delivery” and “Toronto food delivery”. This allowed us to get a steady source of sign ups from people who were looking specifically for services like ours. This accounted for around 20% of the customers. The last strategy was seasonal discount. We would offer a discount code on our website, Facebook ads, as well as our social media accounts on average once every other month. Every time we put up a discount, we saw a noticeable increase in sign-ups. This accounted for around 5% of our customers. We also tried a bunch of strategies that did not work. Notably: Giving out sample meals at local gyms: extremely expensive and did not generate a single customerPhysical cards with discount codes at our hubs: expensive to create and did not generate that many sign upsSponsoring sporting events: to be fair we didn’t spend a lot of money doing this, but we sponsored an athlete (who was a friend) for a while and did not get any sign ups from that ‍"," I’m currently working on my next startup project, The Travel Brief, which is a platform that crowdsources useful travel information. You can follow our progress here! Other than that, I’m not a prolific social media poster, but you can always follow me on Instagram or Twitter."," I don’t specifically seek out business advice, but I really enjoy listening to the founding stories of other entrepreneurs, especially small entrepreneurs. There’s this podcast by this Australian entrepreneur Nathan Chan, who interviews a lot of mostly small founders on his show, which I both enjoy and find helpful. Other than that, I use this app called Flipboard for most of my reading. I follow “Startup” and “Business” interests on it, and from time to time it suggests very insightful articles on various topics from growth to managing staff. I realized that it’s almost impossible make any generalized true statement about how to successfully start and grow a business. Every entrepreneur faces a different set of circumstance and what worked for one entrepreneur might not work for another. What comes to mind right now is regarding hiring people. I’ve heard some successful business people (I think it was either Eric Schmidt or Paul Graham) insist that you need to hire the best and the brightest even if they are terrible people and others argue that they focused on hiring people who played nice with others on the team even though they weren’t A players. I think both of these approaches are true, but in different circumstances and times.  My only advice is to take any business advice with a grain of salt. None of them are universal laws and they are all context-dependent. ‍"," When we started with our 20 friends, we had a weekly revenue of around $300. By the time we shut down, we were doing weekly revenues of around $25,000, or $100,000-$125,000 per month (our ordering cycle was in week so it’s easier for me to think in weeks). In terms of expenses, almost all were operational related to food production. Ingredients accounted for the single largest piece, around 40% of revenue. Industry recommendation is that no more than 33% of revenue should be ingredients, but our prices were just so low. Then it was staff. We had a team of 8 people, consisting of 6 cooks, 1 driver and 1 customer service rep. Aside from 1 head chef, there was no other management personnel. Collectively accounted for around 35% of revenue. Then it was advertising, where we spent probably around 10% of revenue. Another 10-15% on things like rent and admin expenses and emergency expenses (like all the losses from the health department episode). Remaining 0-5% was basically the money my and my partner’s salary. So, all in all, we basically made no profit. ‍",Food & Beverage,Legal Challenges,Canada,"October 26, 2018",Steven Long,https://www.failory.com/interview/chowdy,"['https://www.thetravelbrief.com/', 'https://www.instagram.com/stevedotlong/', 'https://twitter.com/SteveDotLong']",failure,0,,"Steve and his housemate were always complaining food was expensive in Toronto.

38,circle," Hi! My name is Andy, I’m 32 and I’m based in New York. I’m one of the co-founders of Circle, a modern community platform, where I lead growth and marketing. Circle allows you to easily create your own premium online community. The community is white labeled and it can be integrated directly into your website. Inside of your Circle community, you can host content, resources, and live video events for members. Members, at the same time, can have discussions and send messages between them. ‍",," We’re in a very competitive space. Therefore, one of the challenges we face is making our value proposition and differentiating from some of the more established tools that are out there, like Slack communities and Facebook groups. Another of the challenges is helping our creators have engaged communities and have members to interact between them. A lot of times, online communities can lead to ghost towns. Therefore, we help our creators build active communities that are valuable for their members. ‍",," We're growing really quickly right now. We're adding hundreds of customers per month. We're a venture-backed startup so we have really ambitious goals in terms of the vision that we want Circle to realize. The launch particularly brought a huge growth and boosted revenue - we did as much revenue in that month as we had done in the six months before it. By December 2020, the team is formed by 12 people (but we’re hiring!), including the three co-founders, some engineers, and some customer support people. Basically, everybody is either under Product or Engineering except for myself and our Customer Support Head. We’re really focused on product engineering and customer success.",," While in Teachable, my co-founders and I were always looking and chatting about projects and stuff we could work on. That’s when my co-founders Sid and Rudy started Circle, just as a side-hustle. They began by building a little version of the product which took them about a month. They kept adding new features over the following two months, and, soon, they got a few people willing to try it out. At that time, it was a private version. We only invited some creators we already knew, mainly from our jobs at Teachable. Rudy also knew many course creators from his own web development and design business, so he invited them as well to try the tool. From there, Sid and Rudy began to iterate really quickly based on the feedback of the initial customers. They spent a couple of months where they'd add one or two customers at a time, every few weeks. That kept in that way until January 2020, when we said: “This is enough of a product for people to actually get value from. What if we actually go out and turn this into a company?”. That’s when Circle was born.",," My co-founders and I worked at a company called Teachable for 4 or 5 years. While we were there, we noticed something interesting happening in the creator market.  Creators are people making money from their passion, generally building an audience, connecting people, and teaching online. A lot of these people create content and, by the time we started Circle, there were already a lot of tools to host this content. However, there weren’t many tools to host the creator’s audiences. Therefore, we decided to create a tool that allowed these creators to build a community really easily and integrate it within their tech stack and websites. ‍"," I've always been surprised by how patient our initial customers were with us. At the time many of them joined, Circle was missing a lot of the “table stakes'' features and things that any community tool should have. Despite that, our customers were incredibly supportive. Literally, Circle wouldn't exist without the support of the first 10-20 customers that took a big chance on us. We’ve found that people are very open-minded and very patient if you're just upfront with them. That was one of the biggest lessons for me: to not try and make everything perfect before getting it out there into the world. ‍  One of the biggest things I was worried about early on was doing 1-on-1 demos and showing a very early product. When creators use our tool, they are showing off Circle to their entire community. They rely on it for their business. That's a big responsibility that a lot of times, we feel the weight of. I lead marketing and growth so I’m often the one who’s talking about Circle and positioning it in the market. And I really do want to make sure that the right people end up using Circle and that we disqualify the people that’s not the right fit. What I would've told myself early on would be to just get really clear about who our best customers are, and try being really upfront about whether or not Circle is the right fit for their specific use case. ‍"," We launched Circle in August 2020. From January until August, all we did in terms of marketing was to create a landing page with an email waiting list. We were able to grow that list to thousands of people who expressed their interest in the tool.  When users subscribed to the waiting list, they also had to fill a survey saying who they were, how they wanted to use Circle, what they were trying to accomplish, what their use case was, and what were they willing to pay for it. Based on their responses, we decided if it was a great fit or not. If it was, we invited the user to a free trial of the beta version. Once the trial ended, we told the user about Circle’s monthly price and hopefully, it would pay. To better onboard the customers and get their feedback, we did hundreds of 1-on-1 demos. It was a really manual process - I had around 7-10 onboarding calls every day, each of them being 30-40 minutes. However, it was a great way to grow our revenue and improve retention. During the 6 months prior to the launch, we worked really closely with our customers in order to improve the product. We had our own Circle community where customers could share ideas on how they were using Circle or thoughts on what was missing in the platform. Customers really felt connected to us and the brand, which also boosted word of mouth. I highly recommend creating a community of your customers. Eventually, we decided to carry out a public launch (here’s a post we did on Medium about it). To do so, we created a more marketing homepage, which included the stories and testimonials from some of our customers. We launched on Product Hunt and ended up as the #1 product of that day. Having a list of customers helped us achieve this position, as we announced to them that we were featured on PH that day. We also got some press coverage for our launch. We managed to get featured on TechCrunch, for example. ‍", Make sure to check Circle.

39,claimcompass," My name is Alexander Sumin, I’m 31 and I’m typing this out of my office in Sofia while sipping on my 6th or so cup of coffee for the day (I’ve lost count).  I’m one of three founders of a company called ClaimCompass where we help travelers get paid when airlines screw up their flights. We use tech and data to automatically process flight disruption claims and pay people up to $700 per flight, and we make money by keeping a cut out of each successful case. My formal title, if I can even call it that, is CMO, but I mostly look after what’s best described as Growth - i.e. trying to move all those levers that will result in more customers, lower acquisition costs, more revenue, etc.  ",," Again, it all depends on what stage you’re at. Initially, it’s finding out whether this whole thing could even work. At first, most airlines just jerked us around and wouldn’t pay, so we had no idea what to do. Over time we built some legal know-how, got people with a legal profile on board and began collecting money. Then we nearly ran out of money, so had to fundraise. Then our unit economics broke as we tried scaling - spending more on customer acquisition, but lagging behind in collecting that revenue, etc. Then there’s scaling tech, people, operations, etc. There’s always something.   Not sure if that’s a disadvantage, rather than a reality for any business, really, but we’re in somewhat a competitive space. The barrier to entry is seemingly low and anyone who can build a landing page and drive traffic feels like they’ve got what it takes to run this business. Luckily, that’s not how it works.  One of the greater mistakes, if I can even call it that, is perhaps that we were a bit naive - travel and especially distribution in travel is an unbelievably consolidated space, which makes incumbents sit rather comfortably and a nightmare for a small startup to try to do something differently.  We’ve also spent money on useless things. Be it failed marketing campaigns, hiring the wrong person, building something that has no real application or shipping it half-baked, so again - it has no real application - the classical stuff.  ",," Long term vision is to solve the awful service that we all get when things don’t go as planned in air travel. The goal isn’t to eliminate disruptions because they will occur, it’s just how things are in air travel - lagging infrastructure, growth of the number of passengers carried globally, various events that are hard or even impossible to control - weather, strikes, safety. But there is a lot of opportunities to minimize their impact, by being proactive and controlling some of the damage.  Oh yes, a ton of ideas in the pipeline. You’d be surprised what you can do in what may seem like a boring space at a first sight. Imagine predicting a flight delay two days before it occurs, notifying all parties involved - the airline, the passengers, the companies, etc. So, yes - we are constantly looking for great engineers, marketers, people from the aviation industry, to help us execute that vision. So far, we’re about 26 people, working towards these goals.  ‍",," I’ll have to disappoint you here. No formal process, business canvas or other, was used in the making of ClaimCompass. We just had a couple of Skype calls and decided what we’ll do and see what happens. I think we were saved by the fact that we were all relatively broke, so we were very cautious when it came to allocating resources. A big role played our CTO who not only built a pretty decent MVP, but had also set up the analytics right so we had an idea of what’s going on from the get go. From that point on we went on to try to get our first users, spamming people left and right, posting in hundreds, literally, hundreds of Facebook groups on a weekly basis (that was still allowed back in 2015), message boards, etc.  We did run into obstacles. We still had to figure out, now that we got our first customers to file claims, how do we collect the money we promised them. The idea was to make this an automated process, so that made things even more challenging. The first couple of months we worked out of a single Google Sheets file, trying to understand what the process flow would look like, where could we automate for sure, where would we run into trouble, etc.  Our first PR and media efforts came around the time we joined 500 Startups and raised our first round of financing. I wrote a piece which got us featured in Venturebeat, then we got the Techcrunch announcement, then we did a Product Hunt launch, which to this day I think we absolutely killed as we racked up around 1,500 free leads and got #2 Product of the Day. But to answer your question, no, we did not have a “launch” campaign. ",," My co-founder and CEO - Tanya, came up with the idea. At the time, she was working for a law firm in Germany and thought that we could automate a lot of what goes into processing a flight disruption claim.  Prior to ClaimCompass, I worked for a chartered airline in Montreal doing customer acquisition. Later on, I moved to Berlin to work for a PR and Marketing agency and for a while, I also worked as an analyst for the Canadian Federal Government.  A lot has changed since we first launched ClaimCompass. We were an entirely distributed team working on the idea nights and weekends out of 4 different time zones, doing, among others, a lot of useless stuff, but somehow getting traction. It got to a point where we decided to quit our jobs and give this gig all of our energy.  That drew the attention of our first investors: in October of 2016, 500 Startups and one of their micro funds in Istanbul, invested $200K and asked us to join their program in Silicon Valley. For the next couple of months, we grew the company by about 10x and in March of 2017, with a couple of hundred in booked revenue and very little cash, we decided to move to Sofia, where we hired our first employees.  My past experiences are mostly solopreneurship type of stuff, like real estate rentals, trading stocks, and crypto before it was cool (yeah, like 2014). Can’t say I’ve been overly successful in any of the above.  ‍"," Probably be even more aggressive, move faster and be more determined. We were all learning along the way, so that came with a great amount of uncertainty. Looking back, it’s easy to say that we could’ve been faster, smarter, etc.  On the other hand, I think we avoided much of the mistakes that other companies have done - we were right on concentrating on distribution and marketing early on, to gain traction, attract investors, people, and have something to step on in order to develop the product. ‍"," In our case, paid channels worked quite well as an initial source. We started out with Facebook ads and after about a year added AdWords. I think strategies evolve as the business matures. For instance, we’re now trying to reduce the portion that paid channels account for out of the total acquired users, working on improving how our product converts, increasing referrals and LTV, etc.  A lot of things have failed down the road. We tried offline ads at airports, we tried upselling and cross-selling, various partnerships, etc. This doesn’t mean that we won’t revisit some of these things in a different shape or form, it just means that we didn’t see the value we expected and decided to concentrate on other things.  ‍", Go check out some of the stuff we’ve done here and my very infrequently updated personal blog.," I don’t really believe in theory, so I’d say - just go and do stuff. When you run into something you don’t know - google it.  There’s an unbelievable amount of noise out there that is a complete waste of time and resources. Reading blogs, books, listening to podcasts, knowing the latest acquisitions, funding rounds, founder gossip - that won’t make you a better entrepreneur. Trying to build a company will.  To me, the most valuable skill you can develop is learning how to think. If you don’t know how to think, then you’ll probably end up trying to make up for it by developing a purely technical skill, which will make you a great employee, but not a great entrepreneur.  ",,Travel,,Bulgaria,"August 7, 2019",Alexander Sumin,https://www.failory.com/interview/claimcompass,"['https://www.claimcompass.eu/en/', 'https://alexandersumin.com/']",success,1,$100k-$500k/mo,"Alexander Sumin is one of three founders of a company called ClaimCompass where they help travelers get paid when airlines mess up their flights.

40,cold-email-studio," Hi, I’m Andrew Pierno. I “built” Cold Email Studio, the first product out of XOXO Capital (more on that later). I’m based in Santa Monica, CA. The ‘built’ is in quotes because as a developer, this is the only non-saas business I’ve ever launched. Cold Email Studio (CES) does cold email as a service. We’re an outsourced BDR team for startups. We do everything from hunting leads, to writing copy, to the actual email sending (shoutout to Guillaume Moubeche for creating Lemlist! We’re happy customers.) as well as following up with prospects, handling objections with the ultimate objective of putting meetings on founders’ calendars. We charge a monthly fee starting at $2k per month (currently) though we’ve been steadily increasing prices up to market. Today, I’m focused on building XOXO Capital, it’s a micro private equity firm that buys small, profitable SaaS businesses. We’ve done our first 3 acquisitions and I’m working on raising a fund. I’m sure it sounds odd that a service business from an AI engineer is sitting under a micro private equity company. I hope it will make sense to you by the end of this article and to me in 5 ish years. ‍",," The number one obstacle for me was pushing through burnout and cranking through another product launch. It’s still remarkable to me that functionally I didn’t do anything different than other ideas that failed to take off. Other than “Build something people want”, it’s hard to reconcile that you can do everything right and have a $0 outcome. Another one was not trusting my co-founder Mikey completely. I’m an operator and so is he. I tend to take control and go do what I think is right, and that doesn’t leave much room for other people to be comfortable enough to do the same. It’s a strange thing to start something and quickly give up control to someone else, but it was the right move. Seeing the hunt for a great CEO play out poorly at the venture studio, I decided to do it early and it worked but was an uncomfortable process. Thanks for your patience, Mikey! I made the mistake of being too flexible with customers. The cadence of this business is hard to manage. We took on several customers that would frequently “pause” campaigns. It made billing annoying and lumpy. ",," Cold Email Studio will do about $14k this month and is on track to hit $20k by April / May. We have 2 full-time people and 4 part-time people, not including myself. I still try to be helpful to Mikey and mostly do sales now. From this point forward the primary objective is going from a job for ourselves to a scalable, repeatable process. It’ll be a struggle and I know we’ll hit some kind of ceiling somewhere but I have no doubt in my mind this is going to be a sellable $1M ARR business in a year or two. Our 2021 goal is to be at $50k in MRR while keeping our margins consistent. The acquisitions part of the business is my primary focus. What everyone forgets to mention when they talk about buying companies is that you’re buying a job. These companies do anywhere from $1k to $6k in MRR so not all of them can support full-time people yet. So far, we’ve grown the portfolio value by about 45% and now have some results to start showing to investors. My goal for this year is to raise a $1M fund for XOXO so we can buy more companies. The strategy here is to treat small SaaS companies like real estate. We buy them, hold them, and distribute the excess cash flow each month to shareholders. I just love the idea of having a viable exit path for bootstrappers and can’t wait to see how this space evolves over the next couple of years. I was working on my pilot’s license before Covid hit, and look forward to getting back up in the air. ‍",," Of course, the first thing I did was crack open my editor and started building a landing page. I realize the irony here. I did build the initial landing page myself using Tailwind UI but mostly because I was excited about Tailwind. It took about 2 hours and could have more quickly been done with Carrd or Webflow. Here it is in all its MVP glory. The only changes I made were the logos (which came later) but everything else was what the first few people I cold emailed saw when they went to the site, including a self quote because we didn’t have any testimonials yet. Outside of the landing page, I loosely settled on what the offering was. Cold email as a service. I didn’t realize the power of this phrase at the time but I’m a huge fan of single sentence value propositions. It gives your customers clarity. There’s no confusion. They get it, and they can decide if they want it or not. The other benefit of that phrase was that for whatever reason, it felt novel to the initial group I reached out to. For the devs out there: The tech stack was Tailwind with NextJS and I threw it in a docker container and put it up on my favorite service Google Cloud Run. It’s a scale to zero service that makes getting a docker container behind an SSL cert effortless. No, I did not get paid to say that.  The next day I finished up the copy on the landing page and knew I was going to reach out to startup founders. It’s what I know, and I’d crafted the messaging just for them. I used YCDB to find the most recent batch of YC companies. I used WebScraper to get the list of companies and their domains, and one by one I looked the founders up on LinkedIn and used a combination of Hunter and Phantombuster to grab and validate email addresses of founders. I put together a list of about 100.  The message was simple. We do cold email as a service, can I do a campaign of 100 people for free for you? The objective here wasn’t sales, it was logos. I knew that if I could reputably say we’d worked with a bunch of YC companies, then I could leverage the star power of the YC brand to sell other startups. I sorted the list of 100 people in a spreadsheet by alphabetical order and manually sent out 10 emails. Here’s what I sent.   I sent 10 of these and within 30 minutes, I had booked 2 meetings. Interest! Interest, unlike anything I’d ever tried before. To be clear I’d done this same process dozens of times and seen it done many more. Very rarely do results come in this quick. Within the first week, I’d signed up the first few customers to do a pilot for free. I can imagine how frustrating this will be to read, but I promise you, I’ve taken these same steps many times before without any results. Not even any “F-you! Remove me or I’ll sue you” emails! It was by accident that I got the right message to the right person at the right time. The subject line “cold email as a service” was crisp and clear. I was offering to do a job that they didn’t want to do. The work is time-consuming and kind of sucks. They were thrilled to let me do it. The product found its audience very early and very quickly. It was all quite lucky if I’m honest. Over the next few weeks, I continued emailing founders manually and had similar booking rates. After two weeks I had 7 YC companies I was doing the service for. With only one problem. I wasn’t charging anything yet. As far as execution on the service, I did everything myself. I wrote copy, I hunted the leads, and I set up the campaigns. It was a one-man show, and it was already starting to take up a lot of time. It took all of my willpower to finish out the month for those first few customers for free. Once I had some results from real customers and their permission to use their logos on the site, I continued reaching out to founders on the original list I put together with a similar message, tweaking it each time for clarity and transparency. Eventually, I got the confidence to ask for some money and got the first customer for $500 for the month. I was over the moon. Each time I got a few customers paying, I’d double the price. I did a few at $500, a few at $1000, a few at $1,500 and now we’re moving everyone to $2,000 a month. As someone who was doing an AI startup for years, the dynamics of an agency-type business were foreign to me. One thing was immediately apparent though: service revenue grows a lot faster at the beginning than SaaS revenue does. Objectors will claim that service businesses have lower margins than pure SaaS, and that’s generally true, but my last companies’ margins looked a lot closer to a service business than a pure SaaS. AI companies have expensive infrastructure and generally, that means lower margins. A16Z has a great article on this. All that being said, I do think that most people should start with a service business. It gives you cash flow to play with. This game we’re playing is about the number of times at bat. Cashflow gives you more swings, and if you have a sustainable service business bringing new ideas and customers, you can be growing an audience to launch a do-it-yourself version of the service or other SaaS products. The irony in all of this is that I’m not a marketing guy. I’m a dev. If you told me I’d be selling this cold email service (and loving it) a year ago I would have laughed at you. My pitch to these founders at the beginning was not that I’m an expert in this area, it was that I’m going to run data-driven experiments and together we’ll A/B test our way into a repeatable cold email playbook you can take with you.  From sometime in October to mid-January, I was doing nearly everything myself. It was during this time I had been speaking to Mikey Howe (remember him from the micro acquisitions post I did on Indie Hackers?) about Cold Email Studio. Every so often I’d update him on the progress. He was CEO of a dev shop in the UK and was looking for something new. The timing worked out perfectly and we decided he’d come on board and be CEO.  Reflecting on this now, it seems unbelievable that I’d struggle for so many years, finally get a fish on the line, and then pretty quickly hand over the reins to someone I met on the internet a few months before. What can I say… modern times. I also decided that we had to be 50/50 on it. I worried that an unfair equity split would cause issues further down the line and at the time my thinking was that this company is either going to die, or this question will be irrelevant in 6 months (because we will have grown). Truthfully, I wasn’t ready in the beginning, and doubted myself and unfairly doubted Mikey. As the transition was happening, I had hired a contractor that Mikey was struggling with. It all came to a head one day where it was Mikey or the contractor and though subconsciously I knew this was a likely outcome, it was still a gut-check moment for me.  Needless to say, Mikey stayed and we had a rough week of pissed-off customers but pushed through it together. From that point on, I tried to step back and let Mikey do what he does best. I’m sure it wasn’t easy on him, but I’m very grateful he stuck with me. Since then, he’s made some amazing hires and has started turning this business from a job into a machine. ",," After the first company I tried to start failed, I joined a venture studio as a developer, working my way up to Head of Development. We had 3 companies in our portfolio, and after one became apparent it was going to be the winner, I joined full time and eventually became CTO. It was a real-time security and surveillance application (VSaaS) and was the hardest product I’ve ever built.  After a grueling 4 years of raising $8M, winning a Gartner award, scaling up, and then scaling down (shrinking is much harder than growing IMO) I found myself faced with an interesting and exciting question. What do I want to do now? Kidding. That was flippant. I needed cash! Fast! Not bail bond fast, but like... I have a mortgage you know? And Santa Monica ain’t cheap! The reality of not having a paycheck any longer settled on me while quarantining above a garage in Connecticut. My partner and I flew out there for a (small!) wedding. I was in a new environment, perhaps that’s why when I pulled out my list of a thousand some odd business ideas, I wanted to try something outside of my wheelhouse. Keep in mind, I had launched (and failed) at roughly 30 other SaaS products during my time at the venture studio. Some were half-baked, some were “Build it and they will come” kind of things, so don’t think I’m a total loser! I never intended to stay at the venture studio but got stuck in a cycle launching stuff that “didn’t work”. In retrospect, so many of those ideas would have worked, I just didn’t have the grit to stick with them and had not yet learned how to sell. I knew I wanted to do a kind of studio, but this one was going to be different. During the last few months of the security company, I came across Andrew Wilkinson and Tiny Capital. He had started an agency that ended up being wildly successful and that cash flow eventually allowed him to start buying companies. I thought, ‘This is genius! Starting a company from scratch is hard! But if you just buy it, you skip the whole “will people pay for this?” phase and skip right to the making money phase!’ I put a small posting on Indie Hackers to see if anyone else was thinking along the same lines. Dozens of people got in a slack channel I put together but they all eventually faded away, except for two people, both named Michael, one of which would become the CEO of Cold Email Studio, only I didn’t know it yet. So back to the little quarantine studio above the garage in Connecticut. As a side note, I had just finished my second book, an open-source sci-fi novel, and was working on marketing that through Facebook Ads. I popped open Notion, navigated to my business ideas list, and started reading. I was tired, jetlagged, and burnt out. I put my life into a product for 5 years and it didn’t work out. This is not exactly a great environment to get excited about writing code or enthusiastic about hopping back on the treadmill.  I remember spending very little time picking. I did not scroll endlessly through old ideas. The list itself is structured to have the newest ideas on top. I’m also an incessant builder so I have a rule that I’m not allowed to execute on an idea for at least two weeks. If after two weeks I haven’t lost interest, I’ll build it. The real answer is that I picked this idea because I was burnt out. A hardcore, 2-years-of-3AM-support-calls kind of burnout. But this idea? This idea I don’t have to write any code for! LFG!"," If you’re struggling with launching a SaaS business, try a service. It’s so much easier to spot a “job to be done” because as a service business, you generally perform a literal job function. There’s no guessing as to whether or not someone would find value because you should be able to go on LinkedIn and find people whose job it is to do your proposed service internally for the company. If you start thinking in this way you’ll quickly see that you can do nearly Anything As A Service.Don’t be a snob about SaaS vs service businesses. I was. If you’re looking to get out of having to work for someone else, the quickest way might be a service. Give it a shot!Service revenue comes faster than SaaS revenue and in higher dollar amounts. Yes, the margins can be lower, but not always and certainly not forever as you build out a brand and expand offerings.Scaling people processes (and building people processes) is a very different skill set than building engineering teams and software. It’s a skill set I need to improve upon.Upwork kind of sucks. Great freelancers are hard to find, pay them well. Building trust in a service business is hand-to-hand combat. It’s tactile and visceral because you’re face-to-face with customers (over zoom of course). This is one thing I’ll take with me into every new SaaS I build. The same level of trust needs to be there for SaaS, but for a self-serve product, you don’t always get the opportunity to speak with every customer before they sign up. This means you need to build the same amount of trust but generally have to do it through the product and brand.So many things have to go right for a business to get off the ground, and so few things have to go wrong to kill the whole thing. "," We primarily use cold email as a sales channel. Every once in a while I get someone that goes deep on Twitter and stumbles across us. The other nice thing is that someone posted on BookFace (YC’s internal chat) about us and we got a bunch of customers from that. I also had another gentleman that posted on the Entrepreneurs First slack group about us and we’re still getting a few meetings coming in from there. But overall, we haven’t started marketing yet. It is somewhat of a gestalt when we cold email our prospects. They open the cold email, read it, and think “Man, these guys must be good… I opened this cold email!” and they book a meeting. This is unlikely to change. Another benefit of having outbound cold email as a strategy for a young service like this is that we can somewhat control demand. It would be very easy to get overwhelmed with interest that we couldn’t support. It seems like for each 10 net new customers we bring on, we need a new process (i.e. people, i.e. expense). Scaling people processes is not my wheelhouse, and I thank my lucky stars that Mikey is now CEO of Cold Email Studio.", You can find me on Twitter.

41,colorado-mobile-drug-testing," I’m a retired Law Enforcement Officer having specialized in drug-impaired driving and detection as a DRE (Drug Recognition Expert) and DUI Instructor for a total of 20 years. I was also a DARE Instructor teaching the DARE curriculum to elementary school children for 8 years.  I graduated from Kaplan University Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Criminal Justice Administration. I'm currently serving as a Board of Director for the National Drug & Alcohol Screening Association (NDASA). When I retired from law enforcement, I wanted to start my own business and use some of the skills I gained as a police officer. The concept of  Colorado Mobile Drug Testing began from my wife Stacy and I sitting at our kitchen table and has now grown to two offices, the first located in Fort Morgan Colorado (which covers Northern Colorado) and the second located in Denver, just 5 miles west of Denver International Airport. I recently started a podcast for our industry utilizing my teaching skills and expertise in the drug and alcohol impairment field. The podcast is called Clearing The Haze and can be found on almost all of the podcasting platforms. ‍",," The biggest challenge has been in taking personal time away from the business. The success of the business is something that's constantly on my mind, trying to figure out how can I make it better and how can I serve the clients. It’s like my baby. For me, this has meant a struggle to take time for me personally and away from the business. I've gotten better at doing this since joining a mastermind coaching group with other entrepreneurs. This has been the greatest tool and investment that I've made for myself!  The only disadvantage that I can think of is that our status in this industry is only within Colorado, which can make it difficult to get as clients companies that aren’t only located here or those companies who like our services but would also need it in other places of the country. The only mistake that I can think of is that I haven’t allowed anyone to join us as a partner. A good mutual friend of mine got involved for some time. The problem is friendships and business are totally different things and in our situation, it didn't work and a friendship I had for many years changed forever because of our business. Stacy and I decided because of this experience that we wouldn't take on a partner or anyone else wanting to buy into our business, not understanding or seeing the vision that we have had from the beginning. It's really hard to give someone a stake in your business when they’ve only seen what it is now and not having been there when you made the struggle, when you didn't have a paycheck and when you had to pour everything into the business. ‍",," Employers need help in identifying individuals in their workplace that may be suspected of being under the influence of drugs and yet the employer has never been trained in what to look for, so this has been a goal and area of focus for us to help provide clarity and in recognizing the signs and symptoms of drug impairment. One of the areas that we want to focus on is the training aspect of our business. On May 22, for example, we carried out a one-day virtual summit. Right now, with COVID-19, a lot of summits, seminars, and training have been canceled. What's unique about a virtual summit is that the whole business team can participate in it and have lifetime access to the topics. ‍",," Colorado Mobile Drug Testing was formed on January 3rd of 2012 in our kitchen table at our home. We knew we had a good idea and we set out to ensure that the service was what our community wanted and needed. At the time we were creating the company, we saw an ad from a local community college offering a small business plan course open to only 10 companies and a monetary award for the first three places. We submitted our application and we were selected out of 55 businesses. This gave us the opportunity to see not only if our business was viable but also if it was an idea that would be able to get financial backing if that was the route we wanted to go in. Long story short Colorado Mobile Drug Testing came in second place and was awarded $8,000 which used as seed money to purchase supplies, products, and other company needs. Now, 8 1/2 years later, we have two brick-and-mortar offices where our clients are able to send their employees to. Even though we also offer on-site mobile services, 80% of our business comes from these two offices. Neither my wife Stacy or myself have ever owned a business before or knew exactly where to start, so utilizing the Small Business Administration (SBA) was crucial to our success. A lot of times, small businesses or entrepreneurs just starting out don't realize what an incredible resource this is and how they can help your dreams become reality. We would strongly urge anyone thinking to start a business and who are wondering if their idea will work, to contact the SBA, and see how they can help. It's been very exciting for us to see where we started and where we are now in the continued growth of our company. Being able to help other businesses stay safe and implement a drug and alcohol-free workplace has been very rewarding. Now we're concentrating on opening more offices in other areas.",," For 18 years of my law enforcement career, I was a DRE (Drug Recognition Expert) and DUI Instructor. As a DRE, part of the protocol was confirming that an individual was impaired and that I was correct in my assessment of the individual. Most of the time they were suspected of driving under the influence of drugs, at the conclusion of the evaluation a drug test is conducted to confirm if the driver has drugs in his/her system that is responsible for the impairment observed during the evaluation. I became interested in employer drug testing and workplace safety after finding out that companies were losing time and money having an employee and supervisor go to a clinic to do drug testing where they would sit for hours due to other emergencies or situations taking priority over the drug testing. I found no one in our area who was doing onsite mobile drug testing for employers and that was when my wife and I began looking into the opportunity of starting a business that would focus on the employers and the needs they have for a drug-free workplace ‍"," As a new business and entrepreneur, I’m sure there are plenty of things that could have been done better, but I wouldn't change a thing. It's because of these challenges and experiences that Colorado Mobile Drug Testing has become a success. My best advice though would be to get the assistance and guidance for free from the SBA. Truly life-changing and service that hardly anyone utilizes. ‍"," This is an interesting question because, at the time that we started our business, most marketing was done using postcards and internet ads. When starting, I took a business plan course in which I was asked to create a web page. I tried to save money and decided to do it myself. I used to think I had done a fairly good job until I read the book Building a Storybrand from Don Miller’s, which talks about clarifying your messages. This book was a wake-up call! We knew that if we were able to implement the strategies taught, it would significantly change our business. What we did then was to look for people who have been trained under the Storybrand model and that resonated well with our company. We found a guy and we decided to hire him to get our website done. It took quite a lot to be created, but in the first month of launching it, inquiries into our services increased by 500%. Another marketing strategy we used was learning how to implement copyrighting in our business. We went through Ray Edwards’ Copywriting Academy where we learned how to create our own email copy campaigns. Nowadays, we work on SEO and email marketing. ‍", You can check our website here and our weekly podcast “Clearing The Haze” on any podcasting platform. We’re also in Linkedin and Facebook. Or just email me at chuck.coloradomdtesting@gmail.com ," Already mentioned the SBA, but what has really inspired and helped me has been one book and many podcasts. The book was The Success Principles from Jack Canfield and it completely changed my life and my business. Because of this, I’ve bought 20 copies and have been giving them as gifts to employees and other people. This book has changed my perspective and life in so many ways, from learning the power of asking, taking responsibility for my actions in business, to learning that ultimately what others think about me is none of my business. Sometimes as new business owners and leaders we don’t have a real blueprint on how to grow a business or how to be a leader, but authors and books like this sure make it an easier road to travel and understand! Podcasts have also been a huge source of learning and growing especially with as much traveling as I do on a daily basis. The first podcast that I ever listened to that impacted me was “The School of Greatness” by Lewis Howes. I hope I can bring him on to my podcast someday to thank him for his podcast as well as the inspiration and guidance I received. Two other podcasts I really enjoy are: Ray Edwards Show: Ray is a copywriting and marketing master who helped me realize how important the words we share are and how they can really make a difference in our business.Ed Mylett Show: This man is incredible and truly inspirational.

42,combat-flip-flops," Iowa guy. Joined the military in 1997 and left in 2006 with a few deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. During my time overseas, I saw that armed conflict could do little to raise a nation from poverty. Coupled with my understanding of U.S. Foreign Policy at the time, I didn’t see the war slowing down. (That was in 2005) Fast forward to 2008. I was hired by a Seattle company, Remote Medical International, for military and government sales. We focused on providing medical providers and clinics in “austere” environments. My job was to assist the government and service providers with help in “difficult” regions. On my trips to these regions, I witnessed the non-military side of war zones. In those war zones, it was entrepreneurs that were the real change makers. They set up businesses, employed citizens, and maintained their own security. Everywhere I went, I saw the same thing. On a trip to Kabul, I was invited to visit an Afghan combat boot and uniform factory. In this factory, I witnessed hundreds of people working--this was the first positive outcome I saw from the war effort. When I found out the factory was going to shut down after the war, my elation turned to fury. Then it happened. I looked on a table, saw a combat boot with a flip flop thong punched in it, and thought it was cool. The factory manager agreed to let me run with it and I immediately returned to my hotel room to register Combat Flip Flops domain. Combat Flip Flops is a mission-based company that empowers American consumers to manufacture peace in war zones with economy. We work with local entrepreneurs to make fashion and lifestyle products. Each product sold funds a day of education for an Afghan girl. It’s been an amazing adventure and thankful for all of the friends, family, and coworkers that got the company to where it is today. ‍",," There were lots, but the one that stands out is our footwear factory closures in Afghanistan. Our plan was to leverage the boot contracts won by the factories to cover the overhead while we built up the footwear line. Unfortunately, the factories lost their contracts during our first run. We had thousands of pairs of footwear material and no place to make it. With no money and a basic idea of the construction process, the team built a guerilla flip flop factory in my garage and Andy got carpel tunnel syndrome sanding 8,000 individual flip flops. In spite of the fear, lack of knowledge, and no money--we delivered. Since then, we’ve moved our footwear production to Bogota, Colombia. CFF textiles are made in Afghanistan. Jewelry made from recovered landmines is made in Laos. T-shirts and other items are made in the United States. Fail. Learn. Improve. Repeat. ‍  We fell for a lot of the digital marketing company hype. If you have any kind of success or media, you expect your inbox to be full with “digital marketing experts” that guarantee a 10x ROI, 400% increase in sales, and unicorns on payday. Most of the time, these are people that worked in an agency, learned how simple the process is, and decided to go it on their own. You’ll see great metrics and references from one or two of their customers in the sales call, get excited, then invest a great deal of time getting them integrated into your digital environment. After a few months, you’ll be lucky to see an increase in direct platform return. By the time you add in their services fees, you’re making a lot less than if you were doing it on your own. I’m not saying all digital marketing companies are illegitimate, but it’s really tough to discern the players from the ballers on the sales calls. To date, we have yet to find a company that can generate returns from advertising better than our internal team. Spend the time on Youtube tutorials, find your market, generate your own ads, and measure your returns at a low level, then scale. We’re of the belief that “you miss all the shots you don’t take.” We’ve taken plenty of shots with online partners and missed. As a business owner, you should learn how this works, grow your system until you can hire a dedicated team member, then scale. ‍",,," As a company, our biggest disadvantage is that people have a hard time wrapping their heads around our mission. A team of Rangers and business people making products in war zones and funding women’s education? Who in their right mind would do that? It’s been a struggle since day one to educate the customer on the mission to get them past the “buy now” hurdle. Personally, our disadvantages come from inexperience. We had never done this before, so we had to learn everything along the way. They say, “Knowledge comes from experience. Experience comes from failure.” Picking up the trend here? ‍"," Painfully. We never ran a business. Never made footwear. Never started a clothing brand. We knew where we were and where we wanted to go. The company has three founders. Donald Lee--fellow Ranger that now serves as our CMO. Andy Sewrey--my brother-in-law that serves as our president. Together we managed to scrape up enough money to get samples made, build a website, and start marketing on social media. We presold product, built it, shipped it, then reinvested back into more inventory. We started with simple sketches and sent those to footwear manufacturers. Using their magic, they turned our drawings into footwear. After that, it was a matter of buying the tools to cut out the shapes and stamp the outsole. With that basic tooling, artisan craftsman shops turned our idea into a sexy piece of footwear. The tech is fairly simple. To start a company, you simply need an internet connection, smartphone, and laptop. We use Shopify as our online store, Facebook ads manager, Quickbooks online, and a few other subscription apps to tie everything together. Logistics kills most product-based companies. Until July of 2017, we managed all warehouse and shipping out of my garage. Recently we moved to a third party logistics (3PL) company to manage those services. It’s been an iterative, and extremely painful process. We learned a lot along the way and still learning every day. ‍",,," If we could do it all over again, I would have focused more time on understanding the relationship between the Profit & Loss statement, cash flow, and high margin products. Lots of people watch ABC’s Shark Tank and believe they understand the process, but there’s a little more involved. Are you operating on cash or accrual method? Does your cash support the lead time on the product if your demand grows significantly? Are your bills spread evenly through the month? Or do they hit in a big chunk? Doing it all over again, we would have paid more attention to these details from the get-go. Another thing we wouldn’t do is focus on retail. Over the past five years, consumers made a major swing toward online purchasing. This put a huge hurt on retailers. They’re adjusting--meaning they’re sticking with their highest margin brands and taking a little risk on new brands. Without a major windfall event where retail customers demand product, breaking into the major retailers is time-consuming, expensive, and low margin. Focus on direct to consumer sales. When the retailers come, it will be an added bonus."," We started like most people, on Facebook. That’s where people spend their time, so that’s where we advertise. The company started with fun posts and videos. It’s evolved into a process involving targeting, measuring attribution, and adjusting our content to reflect the highest returning initiatives. There’s no secret sauce here. You simply need to try out what works, measure, improve, repeat. Be authentic. Whenever we attempt a “best practice,” the results are not as good as when we generate authentic content. Try, measure, improve. Repeat. Public relations and media have been good for us. Find media or influencers with bigger followings that you, reach out, and see if they have interest in your product. If they talk, write, or broadcast your product--the people will come. After five years of working, adjusting, and improving, we have a core team of three that comes up with ideas, builds creative, and produces content to support sales.

The majority of them were interesting and inspiring business books. When I made the transition to civilian life, the thought of sitting in a classroom turned my stomach. When looking for alternatives, I found personalmba.com. It’s a series of 100-ish books that cover all aspects of running a business. Funny thing, I’d already read half of them on deployment… Seemed logical to finish it up. I still return to these series of books and website when I have questions about my business.Google - This one is pretty simple. If you have a question, ask Google. Within a few button clicks, you’ll learn that you’re not the only person with the question. Read the problem-solving options, make the best decision applicable to you, and move forward.Youtube - Keep it simple. In addition to the “Google” answer above, there’s an entire community of people that video record problem-solving solutions. Down to the buttons to click. If you’re a visual learner, this is a great source for you that can be sorted by relevance and posting date. Pay attention, take notes, and put in the time. Regarding tools, I love three: Mastering the Rockefeller Habits - If every great leadership and business book got together, donated DNA, and created a baby, it still wouldn’t be as good as this book. This 100-ish page read is a prescriptive approach to setting goals, achieving them, and growing rapidly. Read. This. Book.Selling the Invisible - As Cuban states, “Sales cures all problems.” It doesn’t matter if your an introvert, you need to be selling. This book helps you understand how and why the best salespeople succeed with services, products, or ideas. This was one of the first dedicated sales books consumed post-military and still one of my favorites.How to Win Friends and Influence People - Customers, employees, family, mentors, mentees. Business is people. Arm yourself with the tools to be successful in most situations. Simple principles are the best and this book is Old Testament business interaction 101. Here are some tools I use every day: Google Suite - When you start a business, you’re likely underestimating what you’re going to need for emails, collaboration, video conferencing, calendars, productivity tools, etc.. The list feels endless. Dollar for dollar, Google provides the most affordable, robust platform for small businesses to succeed with the pace of modern technology.Google Sheets - Yes Excel has more features. Yes Microsoft and Mac spreadsheets look prettier. Yes, Google Sheets can perform all of the functions you need to run a small business without all of the new license fees, updates, crashes, and cumbersome collaboration.Google Hangouts - Once you set this up, you can have meetings at speed right from your inbox and calendar. It’s glorious for remote work companies or people that travel often. Lastly, I hear some podcasts, especially those about yoga workouts. Yoga studios are expensive, but you can download workouts from all over the world and get a killer workout wherever you travel as an entrepreneur.

43,community-coders," Hey! My name is Kaito, and I’m a 20-year-old university student, entrepreneur, and currently an assurance intern at Ernst and Young based in Vancouver, Canada. I’m in my third year getting my BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) and concentrating in Entrepreneurship and Innovation at Simon Fraser University. Throughout my university years, I've realized the potential that youth have when it comes down to pursuing diversified experiences, failing (and learning) quickly, and being “risky” at such an opportune time of life. I started my first company when I was 19 and it was called Community Coders, a platform that provided high school students meaningful work experience to develop local businesses’ online presence. Think of it as the “GenM” for highschool students in grades 11 and 12 here in Canada. I was the co-founder, and worked on the operations, marketing, and sales responsibilities for about two years, working both part and full time throughout. Our business model was made through selling digital marketing & web development packages to small businesses and paying the high school students at contractors alongside keeping an intermediary/management fee. For example, we charged a business $1k for a website, paid the student $750 and kept $250 for management. Most of my insights will be coming from my perspective with my first business as a university student and youth founder. Now that this chapter of my life is over, I decided to start working on a side project called Spred while I’m on my internship full time during the busy season of accounting. Spred is a workflow management tool that allows clothing resellers to upload, manage, analyze, and sell their clothes to all online marketplaces (like eBay and Etsy), and I’m super excited to have competed in a couple of entrepreneurship competitions for this project.  I also wanted to give a quick shout to the Failory team for featuring me - when I’m answering these questions, I realized that it was an amazing way for myself to reflect and also provide an outlet for some of the mistakes I’ve made.    "," Great question. Honestly, I think there was a combination of reasons of why Community Coders failed.  The first reason was that we didn’t have a product-market fit. We didn’t provide anything of differentiated, unique value to the local businesses that we made money from. Our sales cycle was unsustainable and we were never able to find a good way to get clients in and outs. Referrals turned out to be our best way of getting clients but if you can’t get enough clients in the first place, you can’t get any referrals, kind of like the chicken and egg problem. A lot of this was my fault because I was so attached to providing students real work experience that I thought it had to be a part of our business model, but when it comes down to it, businesses care about the quality of the project itself (whether it’s the website or content creation) and how it brings bottom-line results, and not necessarily the high school student. In short, we did not have enough supply of businesses and too much demand from highschool students. We also wanted to pay high school students fairly so we couldn’t compete on price. The second cause was the fact that I was not the right person to lead the team. Although I think it’s never too early to start a business, I think it takes many tries, lessons, and some failures to eventually build a successful business. With Community Coders, this turned out to be my first real attempt and I had trouble keeping pace with the amount I had to learn, but then also building Community Coders. For example, I had no idea how to properly run projects, so although I would learn agile as I go, there were many mistakes made and workflows interrupted because I hadn’t had any experience before. I think reflecting on the skills that I initially didn’t have before I went into building a company and then realizing the skills I got out of it (front end web languages, agile project management, basic copywriting and social media skills, etc) shows that although it was productive, I wasn’t equipped to build a business. I’m not trying to say that you have to know everything before you start a business, but I didn’t know anything - and that turned out to be a steep learning curve. I realized that we were going to fail when there was just a degree of stagnation that had occurred over the last couple of months. I felt like we were going nowhere, barely scraping by with minimal leads, projects not being completed to the best of my ability, and just an apparent drop in team morale and passion for what we were working towards. This particularly occurred when we were full time on this venture. Going full time on this venture, and putting 100% into Community Coders was important because it showed that with all the resources we had, we couldn’t make this business successful. What finally provoked the shutdown of Community Coders, was a mutually shared feeling within our team of wanting to move on. Personally, I believe that I learned the most that I could out of this experience and that although moving on might be tough, it would not serve the best of my time to ensure both positive personal and career development.  When we officially pulled the plug, I was happy because I could finally let go and consider, and label this business a failure. The stagnation was killing me and it took a toll on my life mentally. Throughout the past months, I felt like I lost my purpose and my stress and anxiety had risen quite a bit. I became a lot more negative and was really not proud of who I was at that time now that I look back at it. A side note: Another thing that really bothered me was being labeled a failure. As a university student, people would often ask how my business was going and the answers throughout my time building Community Coders was relatively the same: “Oh it’s going well, we’re just working on ___”, and now responding with “Oh, it didn’t work out” is kinda tough to say. If you’ve ever heard of the imposter syndrome, there were so many times that hit me so hard, as I questioned myself, constantly thinking about what others thought of me, in comparison to who I was in real life. If you look at my LinkedIn or my personal website, there’s a certain image being portrayed, but I can’t tell you how guilty I’ve felt at certain times when people were inspired by the stuff I do. I think that’s a cause that I’m really trying to advocate for now, which is the fact that I have no idea what I want to do, and that I’m comfortable with that."," One of the biggest mistakes that I made was not finding the right “balance” of planning and doing. I think as entrepreneurs, this is a challenge that you’ll consistently face. Although everybody might tell you to be executing every day, if you’re executing towards an overall plan that is not sustainable, your “execution” is pretty irrelevant. One particular example was when I thought I had to learn Javascript and more advanced languages when I was pivoting towards a freelancing platform. The learning curve for me to learn these languages was very difficult. I wasted about 2 weeks “executing” towards something that I thought had meaningful value.  Another challenge was a competitor, particularly GenM. We were different than GenM in the sense that we paid our students and apprentices, however, what I really respect about GenM is that they were able to prioritize their revenue stream and incentivize business owners/entrepreneurs to provide a healthy, economic supply and demand marketplace from my perspective. By also charging a small price to business owners (compared to where we charged approximately market value), GenM was able to differentiate themselves on price and have a niche market of bootstrapping business owners, while we didn’t necessarily have a niche. Another challenge was that our team was not software developers, and we were working towards a SaaS platform at one point to connect students and businesses. However, we again had to learn languages like C++ to try to attempt and build a platform of this complicated structure and we were not the right personnel for this.  A combination of these mistakes was a waste of most of the time and the lack of prioritization. If I could go back, instead of learning software development languages, I would put more effort into finding more profitable revenue streams to tackle local businesses and use no-code stacks (Webflow, Zapier, Parabola, Bubble) to develop my MVP. I had no idea about visual programming during this state, and could definitely see how this would save a ton of time and money during this period. ",,,," So initially, we came up with this idea in a hackathon/entrepreneurship competition in a weekend and won the top prize (which came with reduced lawyers fees, advisor connections, etc). A couple of months later, we (a team of three originally) decided to start working on our idea once a week. Next thing you know it became every day after our classes, where we would juggle Community Coders and our schoolwork. As a team of three, we all met through university and were originally friends, and it was an interesting experience balancing both the friendship and business aspect of trying to build a company. Our first iteration to building Community Coders was when we shared our first pilot project through our personal social media channels, put up a website, sent some cold emails to some schools and had a Facebook ad - in which we hosted a two-week summer coding/work experience bootcamp exclusively for highschool students in the month of August 2018. We bootstrapped pretty hard, not paying any room fees as we just used some school classrooms, rented out some laptops from our local library, and we all learned code together, including the founders and the students. Our bootcamp students learned HTML and CSS and a bit of Javascript in the first week, and in week 2, they got real work experience developing a local business website in the real estate, law, and construction industry.  We planned this pilot project for about 2 months and then had the summer camp at the end of August. We made about ~$3k by charging the businesses and a small fee for the students. Although this might not seem like a lot, it was a pretty eye-opening experience seeing the opportunity that you as a founder can do to start creating income and opportunity, pretty much from nothing.  From this pilot project, the biggest mistake that I reflect back on now was not treating it as a proper experiment, with hypotheses, KPIs, and knowing what data points to collect (I would suggest reading “The Lean Startup” and “Running Lean” to look into this concept). After the summer project was all done, our team only had qualitative data points and not quantitative. I believe that this led to a huge mistake, as I believed (without any data) from our observations that we had to pivot towards a freelancing platform where you could learn and work all in one because A) everybody would be able to do it, and B) businesses could get talent for an affordable price. Looking back at it, it’s really funny to see the incredible “pivot” that Community Coders made, and I can see that this was a big red flag. To touch upon “pivoting” in general, I think although they should be done quickly, they need to be treated as a calculated risk. Reflecting on the pilot project, I loved the process of getting started - recruiting students, getting businesses to pay us, simply going out there and making our own money. As an early entrepreneur, we made a ton of mistakes, whether it was our sales/marketing/operational strategies, but the one thing that I can’t fault was our effort. We put in tons of time, traveled from city to city walking door to door, was creative with the resources we were given, and these are some of my fondest, and earliest entrepreneurial experiences. Here’s a picture of our pilot project with some of our students! Here’s a picture of our first poster to advertise to businesses: Here’s a picture of our first landing page. We changed it to two weeks:",," To be honest with you, my motivation to build Community Coders could have been the first red flag - I initially had no idea of my own personal “why” of pursuing entrepreneurship. It was my first year at university and I just wanted to try something new. As a 19-year-old, I had no idea what starting a business was actually like, and was inspired by a lot of people on Instagram and LinkedIn who showed the glamorous side. I’d have to say I was a bit misinformed in terms of what starting and trying to build a business actually was like. As soon as I had this idea for Community Coders, I already envisioned having offices Canada-wide and being able to create an impact at the national level. I dreamed and loved the idea of being an owner of something that could be big one day. In terms of my background, I didn’t really have any hard skills or a degree (other than my first-year business courses) that led to starting Community Coders. University helped me start my first business in the sense that it provided additional opportunities, funding and grants, co-op/internship credits and networking opportunities throughout my journey. However, throughout my time building Community Coders, I found that one of the things that motivated me was providing an opportunity for young adults to recognize their own potential. When I was in high school, I worked in fast food for my summer gig, and if I look back at it, doing coding projects or managing social media accounts and getting paid would have been awesome as well - the flexibility, the pay, and the relevant experience for me to leverage on my resume were all solid selling points (not to discredit the skills I learned in fast food as well). I’d say this was the biggest motivator, and I’d like to think I was able to positively impact many students, whether they used our experiences to get gigs at other marketing agencies or get into their dream university programs. I had no idea what the term “entrepreneurship” meant until my first year of university, but I guess I did have some entrepreneurial tendencies. I never stuck with it, but I tried making niche Instagram pages, re-sold streetwear and was always jotting down some ideas (at one point, I tried working on something similar to Mylo, an app that invests in your spare change this was at the end of my grade 12 years) but I had no idea what I was doing. Reflecting on this, I particularly love thinking of ideas and having the creative freedom to express and execute on my ideas.  ‍"," I don’t think I would start over and do it differently, although this it sounds a bit cliche. Community Coders was an absolutely amazing experience, and the fact is, I learned a ton. I believe that a lot of people glorify the failure of their businesses, and instead, what I think should be emphasized is learning. Failing sucks. Throughout my time building Community Coders, I was able to learn a combination of learning hard and soft skills that I believe will be translatable to the workplace, my projects, and my personal life. If I had to have three key, summarized points to tell myself, here’s what I would say: Find a profitable, consistent, customer acquisition method as early as possible (this is harder said than done) for your MVP/pilot project.Document your journey, whether it’s through videos, blogs, tweets, etc. At a stage where nobody knows your venture, you are the best form of marketing for your early-stage business. What I might suggest is, instead of trying to start your company’s social media accounts, start trying to grow yours and connect with people in your target market.Understand that when you step into building a business, it can be a long 5+ year journey. This is something that I didn’t take into account when I started out. "," Marketing definitely was a big challenge because we had not taken into account the branding of our company when we got started. Our logo was portrayed to be more in the education space than we were as a platform and our name (Community Coders) didn’t particularly help when we explained to businesses that we did more than just help them with their website, such as having students build their social media following.  We knew of this challenge pretty early on when we started cold calling and going door to door to learn and start pitching some local businesses for our earlier pilot project that we were launching. Therefore one of the biggest issues of when we tried to do marketing was that our message was a bit confusing, especially to local businesses. Most of the time, the instant question that was raised was “How the hell does coding apply to me?”. When we understood that this was a challenge, we did try to make a conscious to re-brand (such as a name like Community Digital), but I believe that one of the mistakes I made was being so stuck with the brand, and hesitant to change because of the identity that we already developed (even though it wasn’t that big or well known). When it came down to marketing on the student side, there were several strategies that were extremely effective, but I cannot stress the importance of developing unique, one on one relationships with each person that could potentially be of value to your business. The one strategy that stood out to me most was events and offline connections. More in the later stage of Community Coders, we were able to partner and work with organizations such as the League of Innovators, SFU Venture Connections and Canada’s best coding bootcamps. We hosted events for motivated high school students providing workshops or panels. This helped us get a ton of students (about 20% of students joined our facebook group), and turned out to be an amazing way to meet highschool students who were motivated to get real work experience.  Another marketing tactic that worked was posting on our own personal social, (especially LinkedIn) to drive awareness. I understood the importance and also the advantages both from a student learning perspective, and that documenting my own journey - from ideation to execution is something I would suggest for all aspiring entrepreneurs. It builds traction, credibility, and also undiscovered, potential referrals! Here’s a couple pictures of one of our events: And this was our logo: Most of the marketing strategies that didn’t work all had to do when we are trying to get local businesses. Here’s a list of what didn’t work for us (this doesn’t mean that it wouldn’t work for you):  Cold Calling: It was just way too saturated. Funny enough, digital marketers call local businesses all the time and we didn’t have a unique value proposition. In fact, when we said that highschool students who want work experience are going to craft your online presence, it put us at a disadvantage. Our name didn’t help either when we tried introducing ourselves.Door to Door: We started off trying to sell door to door (funny enough, we actually got one), but our conversion rates were extremely low and also didn’t provide an enjoyable customer experience for potential buyers. Imagine a university student walking in, pitching you on a website package with no portfolio during a time you were working 😂.Facebook Ads: To do Facebook Ads properly, I think you have to be pretty well versed in both the analytics/design/copywriting aspect, and it was pretty hard for us to get meaningful results as we were not experienced in this section.SEO & Website: Funny enough, we were never successful in getting leads online. We had no SEO (if you search up coding there’s so much other stuff), tried blog writing (but there the local/small business internet advice niche is pretty saturated), and was pretty unsuccessful for Google Ads as well. We also kept making new websites and designs and should have put more emphasis on our website.  Simply put, we always struggled with getting businesses to hire us for projects. Branding was also difficult because whenever we introduced our company, businesses were confused as coding had no relevance to them. Personally, I believe that although the company name doesn’t matter, it can’t be misleading. ", Here’s my personal website and this is my new project. You can also find me on LinkedIn and Twitter.," My favorite personal productivity tool is Notion (If you’re a student, it’s free!). As for books, I've really enjoyed Running Lean by Ash Maurya. I found this book to be extremely useful when you're working on getting your startup up, (from ideation to execution). I'd also recommend to read Getting Real by 37 Signals: This was the most valuable resource I've read in recent memory, primarily because Jason talked about what worked for their team with ""keep-it-simple insights"". Some quotes that made me enjoy this book that had all to do with smarter, faster and easier ways to build a successful web application include… ""Beta passes the buck to your customers. If you’re not confident enough about your release then how can you expect the public to be? Private betas are fine, public betas are bullshit.

An informed customer is your best customer.""""Here’s an easy way to launch on time and on budget: keep them fixed. Never throw more time or money at a problem, just scale back the scope"" I also use Twitter (5 reasons you need to be on Twitter) and Product Hunt, which I find as a fun past time to see other like-minded makers, and enjoy some of the apps that are available on this platform. Finally, I'd recommend you to check out NuCode: As a “non” technical entrepreneur (not the biggest fan of the term), communities like this can spark your passion and help you understand that you can build a lot of stuff (without code)!.

44,content-snare," Hey! Before all this online business stuff, I used to program controllers that made real-world equipment come to life. Things like motors, pump, even entire mine sites. Like most of us in online business, my business partner and I just got fed up working for other people. We started a long, painful foray into software and web design. Over nearly 8 years we’ve built 3 (and a half) software products for our own business, sold one of them, built countless websites and undertaken some huge software projects for a range of clients. One of the biggest issues we had was getting information and content from clients. To be blunt, it was a total pain in the ass. It held up payments, stalled entire projects and added all this extra stress we just didn’t need. So that’s the challenge we’ve taken on with Content Snare - a tool to help agencies get content from their clients on time and in the right format. My roles in this business are community management and marketing. So… you know… doing interviews like this :) I’m lucky to have a business partner who’s a total tech-head and pretty much the best developer I’ve ever met. He handles the tech team so I can work on getting more people using Snare. Right now, Content Snare has a pretty simple model. It’s a monthly subscription based on how many team members are using the tool. In the future, we may toy with adding some services or add-ons. ‍",," I think we’ve been fairly lucky in this regard. I can’t think of any major things we’ve had to deal with. Some things used to get me really worried, like a competitor releasing a new feature or someone saying something negative. These kinds of things just don’t get to me anymore. I’ve learned there’s just no point in letting them upset you. You just deal with it and move on. The one thing that definitely still gets to me are the periods of slow, or even negative growth. It might only be a few days, maybe a week, but it definitely affects mood. Logically, all you have to do is zoom out and realize everything is still moving in the right direction. ‍  The biggest mistake by far was not being careful enough on feature selection when building our MVP. We rolled too many things into the first version which blew out our development budget. We spent way too much on our MVP. If I had to do it again, I’d pull out everything that wasn’t absolutely necessary, and work more closely with the development team to make sure we were all on the same page. The other big one is probably keeping our web design business going at the same time. It’s hard to call this a mistake because I’m still not sure if it was the right or wrong decision. The original idea was to keep building websites so that we had the additional income to keep us going, and so that I still had my finger on the pulse of the industry. That way I could write posts and make videos that helped out our target audience - so education-based marketing. I’ve since realized that one bad client can eat a whole week of my time (plus the team’s time) that could have been spent on Content Snare. I also realized we can work with other people to provide education to our users through guest posts. They’re experts at what they do. That means they write things way better than I could have and get some traffic and SEO juice at the same time. Truthfully, we probably should have dropped web design sooner. ‍",,," Wow, what a question! For me, it is definitely motivation, especially during those down periods. When we’re growing strongly, it’s great motivation. When things aren’t perfect, it’s definitely harder. Now that I say it out loud, I realized it’s the same when it comes to losing weight… With respect to our market, one of the biggest ‘disadvantages’ I think would be that there are a lot of freelancers out there who are struggling financially. A big part of our user base are freelancers. If they can’t afford our service, we have a problem. That’s why we do a lot of education to help web designers grow their businesses. Plus, it’s nice to get feedback that you’ve really helped someone grow their business."," At first, it was nothing more than a simple landing page built in WordPress. It asked for an email address in exchange for a discount when we were ready. To get people onto the list, I spoke to web designers I knew personally, got involved in Facebook groups and just asked people if they’d be interested. Really basic stuff. I’d heard so many horror stories about products never getting off the ground, so I wanted some confidence that the product was solving a real problem and was something people would be willing to pay for. That meant asking for money before we even had a product. A ‘pre-sale’, if you will. After we gathered a few hundred people, we ran a pre-sale to see if people would be willing to put money down. We offered a full year access to the product (starting when it went live) and beta access at an extremely discounted price. ‍ We sold 25 out of 25 available spots in about 2 hours. That was an exciting day, and it gave us some confidence that the product would work. That’s when development actually started. First, we hired a UX designer to come up with all the different screens we needed. We listed out all the functionality we eventually wanted and removed everything that wasn’t necessary for the MVP. Our business already had software developers, so we diverted their attention to building Content Snare. The front end was built with Angular 2, and the back end with Ruby on Rails. This is the tech stack we use for almost all of our client projects, so it was an easy decision. It took maybe 6 months from the pre-sale until the doors opened. In that time, we continued to build an email list, grow a Facebook group, run ads and run a beta program for the people that had paid for the pre-sale. This was to make sure any major bugs were ironed out before releasing to the public. One thing we focused on I think more than another MVP’s was the look and feel. We invested in good design up front, to make sure the product was visually appealing. Our target market are designers, after all.",," The original idea was actually completely different to what we ended up building. When we were building websites, I was actually pretty annoyed at the briefing process. I wanted to build a tool to help clients better communicate what they wanted in a website. I spoke to a bunch of web designers in our area about their process and bottlenecks. Almost every single one of them ended up focusing on getting content from clients. Not the brief. So basically, the idea was flipped on its head right away. As an agency, we could definitely relate to the problem, which made it fairly simple to think through and design something to make our own lives easier. Somewhere during our 8 years, our business kind of just fell into websites. Really, building and designing software has always been my number 1 business passion. That meant I had a ton of motivation to build this tool and make it our primary business. ‍"," Other than what I just mentioned, I’m really not sure! If I knew the answer to this question, I’d be doing it now. I think I’d say to work on building relationships with potential partners right away. This is a hard one though, as you may need a working product or a “name” in the industry before certain people will work with you. ‍"," It’s crazy when I look back at how many things we tried. If I told you about all of them, the answer to this question could fill an entire book. I was even documenting everything we did but had to stop because it was getting too much. It has been pretty difficult, to be honest. There are SO many different ways to attract new users, and there’s no way to know which will actually work. So, you just have to test them as fast as possible. The two biggest things for us have been: Our Facebook groupA giveaway From day 1, I began building a Facebook group of web designers. These are our target audience, so having direct access to so many of them allows us to better understand how they think and what kind of things they need to improve their business and lives. Through this group, I’ve even made a bunch of friends, several who I’ve met in real life. After this, the most effective marketing ‘tactic’ we used was a giveaway. In the early days, this got many people talking about us in various groups, and doubled our email list in 2 days. One tactic that didn’t work as well I thought it would, was Product Hunt. In the startup world, a lot of people put weight on getting to #1 on Product Hunt. We *almost* did that, except Facebook TV launched on the same day. So, we hit #2 instead. It drove a huge traffic spike, quite a few comments and more than 10x our normal daily signups, but none of them converted to paid users. I wish I could say that there were one or two things that just smashed it out of the park and resulted in explosive growth, but it’s just not the case. Our growth comes from lots of small things adding together, adding a few users at a time. ‍ Here are a few things we’ve tried and have worked to at least a small extent: Getting interviewed on podcastsGuest postsHelpful, quality blog postsSharing those posts in places where people need the helpSEO on keywords our audience is looking forEmail competitions/giveawaysBetaListProductHunt ‍"," You can find everything on the Content Snare website.

It took about 2 weeks to build, another 2 weeks to polish, and then we launched CopyAI to the world. We mainly used Webflow and Firebase. We launched it on Twitter which drove a lot of our initial traffic and got us a few thousand users. When users started converting, we knew we had something. We then decided the initial idea could be extended to other copywriting use cases and started building several features to help entrepreneurs with their writing projects. ‍",," Paul, my cofounder, and I worked together for the last 5 years. During our time at our last company, we kept working on side projects that we felt were important to us. None of them worked until CopyAI. We’ve been fascinated by entrepreneurship and helping people find their passion in business. We realized that being creative is a muscle and requires a lot of work. When we saw what the latest AI algorithms like GPT-3 can do, we knew that they would be able to help lower the barriers of entrepreneurship. One earlier idea we tried was called ConceptHunt where we helped founders discover their next startup idea. It was a daily interactive newsletter for brainstorming. We would send a few fictitious business names and you would have to send us the business model back. Unfortunately, it didn’t go anywhere. We launched other ideas using GPT-3. Simplify.so did text condensing, we built a slack bot that was never released and we made taglines.ai to help businesses come up with their slogans. ‍"," Startups seem to be about momentum. Once you get it started, you need to keep it up. Being fully open and transparent has given us a platform to promote our company and create fans who are a part of our journey. Being authentic and focusing on a big problem seems to be the best way to gain momentum and keep it up. ‍"," Our goal is to inspire more entrepreneurs. That means being very transparent about our journey. As a result, Twitter and the Building in Public movement has been our best channel to date.

",," Bugs works in mysterious ways. Once, we lost a significant partnership deal because of the random sequence of bugs when our potential partner was testing our product. They postponed the partnership for one year, yet we still needed to pay half a fee. Core takeaway: develop a robust testing system as soon as possible. Human errors also work in mysterious ways. We are such losers sometimes, like that one time when we launched a marketing campaign with the wrong URL as a call to action :) Core takeaway: invite your family and friends to click everything clickable before launching anything. Bad investor's deals work in disguise. Core takeaway: a) hire only those lawyers who understand how startups work b) don't hesitate to ask for help from fellow founders.  Investor soft commitment is not done deal.

Our idea was fortunate in meeting co-founders with the matching competence and experience, favorable context in our personal lives, and strong friendship. It took two years of building a product from scratch till public beta launch and two years after that, until this moment when we are confident about what we're building, how to bring value to our clients, and finally, become interesting for VC investors. After we committed to the idea, we gathered building resources — a real challenge started with endless creative possibilities on how to be sure what to build and what not to. I created an internal methodology called Core Truth as a solution for the team. It's a collaborative cloud document, a dedicated place to figure out Product-Market fit and be in tune with the reality of our audience. The document consists of guiding principles for customer interviews, industry insights, user persona archetypes, customer feedback archive, and product-market fit validation methods. We have defined 5 core principles that are guiding us for every ideation and prototyping process: We should feel uncertain about everything we make, yet confident about how we gather feedback. Feedback and debrief hierarchy — Problem, Connection, VibeWishful thinking must not become the attribution of Corebook reality to what product makers wish to be accurate or the tenuous justification of what one wants to believe.We're not looking for opportunities to build new features instead, we're looking for opportunities to create new experiences.Don't fall into the mental trap that learning about the customers' world is something we can finish.",," In 2004, I discovered computer software, artsy-type peers on the internet, heavy metal music, grunge fashion, and boys' ability to grow long hair (the start of my rebel going against everything teenage phase). In 2008, I spent one month in the hospital because of deep pain in the chest every time I breathed. Doctors never really figured out the diagnosis but assumed it was caused by anxiety in a school system where I felt I didn't fit in. I spent most of that time looking out of the hospital window at a lonely tree and wondering about life and stuff. A year later, I dropped out of art school, and I learned what my condition ""autodidact"" means. Then, I started teaching myself design. I founded my first business (graphic design studio) by helping out friends who played in rock bands by designing gig posters, album artworks, band logos, and Myspace layouts. In parallel, I tried to co-found another marketing agency startup. I failed fast because of a lack of money while bootstrapping. In 2014, I began traveling around Europe with nothing but a backpack, rollerskates, and freelance design gigs. My most extended stay was in Venice, Italy, where I lived with local art academy students. Two years later, I returned to Riga, Latvia, and co-founded a time management product startup. I failed fast because of personality conflicts between co-founders. In 2017, I accepted a creative director job offer at an advertising agency, and a year later, I quit the job because of shitty products I had to advertise, and my inner urge to still make f’n amazing sh!t happen through entrepreneurship. Soon, almost like from a scene of The Matrix movie, I met two bright gentlemen who later played a crucial role in my life as my business partners. We started working on a small startup idea called Corebook to disrupt how the industry creates and uses brand guidelines because it bothered us throughout our previous professional lives. In 2020, together with the other two co-founders, we managed to launch the public Beta of Corebook, officially registering the company as a legal entity and raising our first investment capital with a $1.2M valuation. Last year, I set up my second home in Spain’s Mediterranean island Mallorca and got a matching tattoo with a random stranger. Corebook is now used in 30 countries by the most influential brand studios and world-renowned brands."," My main lessons have been: Be open to advise from mentors. Nevertheless, if you open your mind too much, your brain will fall out.Create your own rules.Tomorrow you will be paid for what you do today.Your product will never be finished (deal with it). Integrate failures as a fun activity for team building."," Since we are designers and branding thinkers ourselves, we know where creative-type industry folks hang out, what websites they are reading, which thought leaders they are following, etc. One example: right after our product Beta launch, we created a beautifully crafted product landing page that got a web design award in a particular award organization we picked out to be showcased. It created traffic and interest. The first paying client was impressed by our design craftsmanship and customer service. And above everything, I was personally talking with every user in the early days, which formed trust and confidence in the product although it was in the MVP stage.  "," I'm using Linkedin as my main personal social media platform therefore, my Linkedin engagement rate is very high :) On my personal website, I have a cool footer featuring a floating list of my social and portfolio links.

47,crabi," I’m Cristina Carvallo (CPO at Crabi), I’m 35 years old, based in Guadalajara Jalisco. Together with Javier Orozco (CEO & Founder) and with Arnoldo de la Torre (COO), we founded Crabi in 2017 to transform one of the most traditional industries in México: the auto insurance industry.  Crabi is the first and only startup to offer a full-stack insurance product owned and operated entirely by the company. Our insurance company has become the First CNSF (government approval) Licensed Startup to Provide Full-stack Auto Insurance in Mexico and the only new auto insurance company created over two decades in the country.  Crabi is the first car insurance that you can acquire from wherever you are, whenever you want, while only paying for what you need. We envision a new way of providing insurance that focuses on the person and not the car.   Cristina: I’m currently Head of People Operations/PR, and my main focus is building our culture. We are a young, diverse, and geeky insurance company. Many of our team members work remotely from several states in Mexico, so we invest time and effort to instill our values (be bold, be brutally honest & enjoy the picnic) not only in them but to the rest of the team. Crafting Crabi’s culture is something I am very passionate about!  And as in any other startup, another of my “hats” is being the PR & spokesperson for the company. In this role, I take any opportunities available to talk about our history and how we embarked on the mission of creating a modern, fair & robust insurance product for car owners. ‍",," Cristina: Being a new insurance company with an innovative offering, we faced an initial distrust & misunderstanding about our products. Customers buying auto insurance in Mexico are used to being sold their policies face to face from an insurance agent.  Changing this mindset was our first obstacle as customers were not used to buying intangible products by themselves, let alone from their mobile phones. Fortunately, digital natives have been our most frequent adopters, and they are helping us spread this new model via word of mouth. This is why we are looking for ways to keep incentivizing and rewarding them. Arnoldo: Another challenge has been finding new ways to invest in our growth. Being a small player in the industry means we have a limited budget to compete with already established insurance companies with substantial marketing budgets that allow them to invest heavily in national media & PPC campaigns. In our case, we have to be super creative and efficient. This is why we are investing in our long-term growth by focusing heavily on inbound & content marketing. We know this will take some time, but it will be way more cost-effective for us in the long run. This does not mean we do not invest in PPC campaigns. We do, but with laser focus and constantly iterating to learn and build upon that knowledge. ",," Arnoldo: We are testing new ways to continue growing. Partnered with Buyapowa to launch our first “Refer a friend program”, by which we reward both the referring customer & the referee when they buy an insurance policy with us.  We also launched a new program to reward our best-driving customers when they renew their policy with us. This way they can rack up additional discounts on our already competitive prices. Finally, knowing the price of an insurance policy might be high for people in Mexico, we created a “Subscription Program” in which customers can insure their cars, paying a monthly subscription, like Netflix. And if they want to cancel it, they can do it without the hassle and penalization. We are the only company offering these differentiators, and our customers are reacting quite positively to them. We are more than 50 team members working hard to brainstorm, analyze, execute, implement and promote all these ideas and strategies. All this work is being noticed by our investors, led by Kaszek Ventures. They recently announced an additional $4M in Series A funding, together with Tuesday Capital & Redwood Ventures. We have grown our revenue by 110% this year, and we will continue growing at a 2-digit rate for the upcoming year. To offer a unique experience to our users, we are building an “Instant Claim” platform that will allow us to dramatically reduce response times to settle a claim, from a 4 hr average down to only 15 min. Cristina: We are always looking for great talent, which has mainly driven us to accomplish what we have done. Great people are self-directed with autonomy and curious to challenge the status quo and build a zero to one solution.",," Cristina: Before launching our first official product, we tested an MVP with 300 beta users. This stage was crucial as it provided valuable feedback, especially regarding users’ confidence in our product. There were questions about our solvency, financial backup, and capabilities because we were a new company with a revolutionary business model. We took this feedback and worked for a couple of months to come up with clear ideas about how to educate our potential customers regarding our model and what it meant for them, as well as to explain & communicate how we worked with an extensive network of top-notch providers all of whom helped us back up our clients in case they needed our services during an accident. We hosted an official launch in May 2019 at our headquarters in Zapopan, Jalisco. We extended invitations to local & regional media representatives as well as to governmental authorities, and we hired a local PR firm to help us distribute the news.  ",," Cristina: Javier, Arnoldo & myself were working on another company founded by Javier. We were manufacturing slot machines for casinos and other venues. One evening, discussing the world and the radical transformation it experienced over the last decade, we began questioning ourselves which other industries were bound to be radically transformed by technology, and a light went on: insurance. None of us had any insurance industry experience, but we studied, we learned, we listened. After spending a couple of years in the startup scene of Silicon Valley, Javier decided to exit his slot machine company and went all in to start Crabi. It has been quite a learning experience. Once we had the idea, we invested months reading auto insurance contracts, understanding the terminology, learning about the business model, discovering the legal requirements to start an insurance company, understanding the regulations, etc. Our first and most important milestone was obtaining our Insurer´s License, awarded by the National Insurance & Surety Commission in Mexico. This achievement didn't come easy we had to grind for it for a little over two years. But once we were allowed to operate as an insurance company, we were thrilled. While going through this process ourselves, we understood how intricate this product is for an average person. This fueled our motivation to create something much more straightforward, fair, and transparent. We wanted to move away from the standard pricing approach by which a user is charged depending on its vehicle model & sociodemographics. Also, we tried to eliminate intermediation as commissions added up to 50% of the total price a user ends up paying for their policy. It is insane! Using technology & data analysis, we began creating customized pricing models that weren’t so focused on the vehicle characteristics but more on the person behind the steering wheel. Also, we created an intuitive app that allows our potential customers to quote & buy their auto insurance in less than 5 minutes, without depending on an insurance agent. We also focus on communicating our product characteristics, benefits, and rules of operation in a much more straightforward & easy to understand way. We aim to be as transparent as possible. At one point, we considered including a driving tracking device as part of our service to better understand our users. However, we had to pause this initiative due to high costs. Crabi has been bootstrapping its way through the car insurance world with excellent traction and valuable user insights without tech and product being the main focus. Now, we’ve managed to create great product teams with an incredible tech infrastructure this will ramp up our value and differentiate us tremendously from our competitors.‍ ‍Our initial idea was to focus on a Pay How You Drive model (PHY), which has proven successful in Europe & North America. However, tropicalizing this model to Mexico was difficult, mainly because the insurance culture in the country is minimal. This is why we had to back out from this idea and craft a model which was more familiar & appealing to our customers."," Pay attention & listen to your customers. Almost every idea in our pipeline comes from trying to eliminate our customers’ pain points. We listen, prioritize, implement and iterate until we solve the problem. This is especially important since we target digital natives who are technology savvy and appreciate being engaged in the process.  ‍"," Arnoldo: Initially, we began promoting and selling our first policies to our family members and friends, but as you can imagine, we got to a point at which this wasn’t just scalable anymore. We then decided to jump into Google Ads and began running performance campaigns but soon discovered that this was not economically feasible at such an early stage.   We were unaware that the auto insurance industry is one of the most competitive niches regarding Pay per Click marketing. For this reason, we decided to temporarily pause this growth tactic and search for a more efficient alternative. The next thing we tried was collaborating with online aggregators which specialized in lead generation. We partnered with one of Mexico’s top auto insurance comparison sites and quickly began our 2 digit growth month-over-month. This helped us scale rapidly and create a relatively extensive customer base to test our operations. We also set our eyes on organic growth and began optimizing our site’s SEO. Our team worked over a couple of months to create a blog that touched every part of the inbound marketing funnel. This past July, we released it with over +90 informational articles. This one tactic has helped us increase our organic traffic from 3K visitors per month to almost 70K per month in about 3 months. And we are now in the process of optimizing our conversion rates to increase our lead generation. We are growing our revenue by improving our product based on customer feedback. We are also opening new cities & states regularly to increase our presence nationwide. Finally, we are focusing on enhancing our renewal rates. "," You can check our website and social media profiles (Linkedin, Facebook, Instagram, and Kaszek)."," Arnoldo: Hubspot's CRM is our most important tool as it allows us to manage, nurture and close the leads we acquire via the aggregator and our direct efforts. It is also super helpful in creating landing pages to test some theories via PPC quickly. Finally, it is helping us lately to create intricate retargeting strategies based on the funnel stage at which the lead is. MessageBird is another excellent tool as it allows us to reduce response times to less than 3 minutes via Whatsapp. It's also a great tool for creating different communication flows depending on the user’s request on various channels.

I do Google Sheet tutorials at BetterSheets, where you can buy lifetime access and get all the tutorials you want. The pricing model is based on Makerpad and I too made BetterSheets with no-code. I also run a newsletter called InfluenceWeekly, where I share the best data-informed articles in the influencer marketing space. It's the top newsletter in my industry with more than 6,300 subscribers.  I'm very active in newsletter groups trying to help people monetize, grow, and start newsletters. I write a lot on Indie Hackers about starting stuff. My mantra is “Go, Go, Go. Launch, launch, launch. What are you waiting for?” ‍"," Three months after launch, either lucky or unlucky, Instagram cut the number of actions you could do. That killed most growth hacks, but the product still exists. I could keep working on it. But looking back the actual problem was people didn't use it. I made a bunch of videos to explain how to use it. It was very complicated. Users needed to first decide to do growth hacks and then try to optimize them with the app. Not many people know 50 growth hacks. I had been doing a bunch of automation on my client accounts. All of their actions were taken down to zero for 30 days. Within one month, I went from 12 paying clients to none. I didn't charge them for Creator Growth Lab, it was free to sign up. I would charge later once I figured out who was it for. Big mistake. I did have the idea of Pro Accounts. Initially, it was created for individual users. I talked to a model agency that had thousands of models that were going to pay for using it. Could have been $9,000 a month. Then another person, a growth hacker, wanted to use it to manage 100 accounts. Their clients also left because of the change in Instagram policies."," Signups weren't a problem, or so I thought. I ended up getting 50 signups per month for four months in a row. The challenge was to get active users. It took a while to get to the aha moment. You needed to use it each day for a week or two weeks before getting the aha moment. That's painful. Users will never get that far. ‍",,,," I had a monthly income from my clients. Every dollar I made, I put it into Creator Growth Lab because I wanted to go fast. I quit my job in December 2018. Gave me a month to mock a prototype. After a month, I realized I couldn't build it fast enough. It was going to take me about a year to figure out how to build it and then three more months to build it. I took all the money I had from my agency, and I used it to pay off one designer and one programmer. I found a designer in Bali. And then I found through a friend of mine, a Vietnamese programmer. My friend became an ad hoc Product Manager and we became a four-person team. It was fast. Within 30 days of working remotely, everything worked exactly how I planned."," Initially, I had a dozen users that were paying me to grow their accounts, who I thought would also use this Lab. They were paying me between $100-$200/month each. It got 50 new user signups in the first month and the next month another 50 user signups. I used InfluenceWeekly to promote Creator Growth Lab to my existing audience and I got a dozen signups from that. I also sent direct emails to creators I knew because I had worked in the influencer marketing industry for five years. ‍"," Five years ago, I had a side hustle where I would grow people's Instagram accounts. I got my clients anywhere between 2,000 and 5,000 new followers every month. Three years ago, Instagram started announcing policies that I knew would make that method not last. This is a natural thing with growth hacking. First, it works well. Then something changes and it does not work anymore. Creator Growth Lab helped Instagram creators to grow by themselves. They could log each day their growth tactics and measure how many followers they gained and their hashtag performance. Every single day you could go to the Lab and see your growth. Then figure out which was the best one. Optimize it and grow more. ‍"," I'm not leaving this industry of creators, I'm not getting offline anytime soon. I can't imagine working for anyone else other than creators. Every single project I ever do is for creators. I’ve learned a few lessons from Creator Growth Lab. A product needs to immediately do more for the user. It’s got to feel like a superpower.  The problem is the same every creator on Earth has, which is how to live off a piece of work I made. ‍  One of the most important things I learned was that I talked to users, but I was not listening to them. I had so much hubris and very little humility because I had been successful at helping people grow for five years. “I went into Creator Growth Lab thinking I knew everything. You don't know anything. Even if you think you know everything you don't.” I spent a lot of time educating creators on why to use the product. Every successful creator will tell you that they grew by making good content. Creators want to create. I had no competitors. No one was trying to do this, that’s a warning sign. It ended up being not needed. Another lesson learned was that you need to talk with users, not just tell them about your product. I've only started to do this within the past years and it opened my mind. When I get on the phone with a user I'm not teaching them how to use the product. I get on the phone once or twice a week with my newsletter readers and ask them about what's going on in their life. Just chatting with them. I would have never tried new ventures if I didn't talk to the same users again and heard the same problems again with a different frame of mind and a different angle into it. Your solution might not pan out and doesn't mean your business doesn't work. It doesn't mean you're not successful. It means that solution didn't work out. Figure out who your tribe is. Find them. If you talk to people for enough time, keep trying different solutions, and keep asking for their problems, you'll figure out a solution. You always have something to learn. ‍",, You can find me on Twitter and Medium," The Dip by Seth Godin. Winners quit. This book tells you to stop what doesn't work for you.

We did not want to bury ourselves in so much debt, where we were working for the first two-three years simply to recoup our losses. We started small, purchased 100 nets, sold them and rebought 200. Now we’re buying in 7500 unit increments. It’s an awesome feeling.    Our worst mistake was launching our company and accepting orders before we had our final product and enough inventory in our warehouse. We’d bring our prototype to the beach and dozens of people would have an absolute blast playing it. We’d then direct them to the site where they’d purchase with the understanding that they’d receive their order in a few weeks. In the beginning, a few weeks turned into a few months, and that was our first experience with how important having good customer service was.  I always tell fellow entrepreneurs to make sure you 100% have your inventory in before you start selling or to properly set customer expectations for the absolute worst. Customers won’t complain about getting their order earlier, but they certainly will about getting it late. We now pride ourselves on having a 48 hour turn-around time and getting almost every order that arrives before 5 PM EST out of the warehouse on the same day.  ",," Our goals for 2020 are to finally release our indoor model that hundreds of schools are patiently waiting for. Teachers and volleyball coaches will be able to take their current CROSSNET model and add our indoor base attachment to create an indoor permanent solution. Set up time will be around 5 minutes and we envision classrooms having dozens of students working on their volleyball skills on our net.  We are also looking to become more involved in the volleyball community and create as many events and tournaments as possible. Financially, we will be looking to hit $5,000,000 in sales in 2020, while continuing to be 100% profitable. With more revenue, typically comes more expenses. We will be looking to bring on several part-time, remote employees to help take CROSSNET to the next level. We will need to hire customer service agents to deal with wholesale and retail inquiries, general customer service issues such as tracking and shipping, and somebody to answer our phone line. Additionally, we will be bringing on graphic designers, copywriters, and an email marketing team. We can’t do everything ourselves and training and staffing will be a top priority for us in Q1 after we wind down from the holiday season. ",," The next morning we woke up with this idea of four-way volleyball on a piece of paper with 200+ ideas crossed out above it. We drove to our local Walmart and bought two volleyball nets, cut their centers out and rigged up a prototype. We then invited our best friends over and started playing elimination volleyball, one hit only, and used old school four-square rules like we were back in elementary school. Simply put, it was a blast and we were onto something. Next up, Mike started crafting blueprints and finding potential manufacturers. We then found one that excelled in the sporting goods industry and patiently waited as we had samples delivered. We’d then wait and wait and wait for some more. We’d finally get the game and immediately point out flaws. Go back onto Whatsapp, relay the feedback and repeat the process. A year later, we had our final product!  While this was going on I was working full time at my job at Uber and coming home at night building the CROSSNET website, while my brother Greg was launching our social media accounts and building hype and an audience for launch.",, I was working at Uber HQ as an Account Executive helping launch the UberEats app in Boston and Providence. I came home for the holiday break and one night was up late with my brother Greg Meade and childhood friend Mike Delpapa. Mike just graduated from NorthEastern with an engineering degree and wanted to invent something. We sat up all night writing down the most ridiculous ideas and then four-way volleyball was proposed. We quickly realized it was not as ridiculous as we thought! ," Break down every single cost and find ways to improve your margins from day one. Negotiate on everything possible. If you end up saving $50 here and $200 there, you may end up saving yourself a month’s pay. I wish we did this in the beginning instead of feeling helpless to these larger companies manufacturing your packaging and product. It would have helped us become profitable much sooner. "," Every time we set up CROSSNET we always gather an impressive crowd. Our four-way net turns heads because nobody has ever seen anything like it before. We quickly figured out that if we were getting this reaction, all of our customers were probably experiencing a similar thing. This meant it was vital to get as many nets out into the world as possible and spread them out across the United States to reach as many customers as possible. We were very selective with ambassadors and influencers who we thought would have the best following and pull in their local communities. We also sought out influencers who had a consistent history of putting out high quality, engaging content. We would offer product exchanges for a video and story post and saw our brand grow overnight. We would then repurposes the best of the best videos and run Facebook and Instagram ads with them to generate revenue.  When starting off with this strategy we learned that if we continued to send out tons of units on a limb and prayer that the influencer would actually create the content we would quickly find ourselves in the red and out of tons of money and product. When selecting an influencer we will always get their personal phone number, email address, and have a way to contact them. There is nothing worse than getting your message left unread by dozens of influencers after shelling out hundreds of dollars to ship your product out and having no idea if you’ll ever see content created. We’ve learned to start small, build trust with your connections and scale from there.  After using the videos to create traffic to the site we are constantly looking at data to determine where customers are dropping off, how we can build motivation, and increase conversion. A few helpful applications that Shopify users should be using are Privy, Klayvio, Hotjar, and Carthook. When starting off with a lean budget we used Privy to capture emails and provide discounts to increase conversion. Hotjar can be used to find where customers are dropping off and will allow you to quickly identify the weakest points of your website. Carthook is an incredible application that we just started using that transforms the checkout process from three pages to one, this has increased our conversion by almost 1%, which is hundreds of thousands of dollars across the year.   ", Visit our website to learn more about CROSSNET.

50,css-for-js-developers," Hi there! I’m a front-end software developer from Montreal, Canada. I’ve worked for organizations like Khan Academy, DigitalOcean, Concordia University, and Gatsby Inc. For the past year, I’ve been building an online course called CSS for JavaScript Developers. It’s a comprehensive course that combines various media formats, from videos to articles to interactive widgets and mini-games. My original plan was to finish the course in 3-4 months. After 6 months, in March 2021, I was only about halfway through 😅. Not wanting to spend a year working on something that might flop, I decided to open pre-orders for 1 week, with the goal of selling $50k. The response was overwhelming—I wound up selling about $550k in that one week! ‍",," I mentioned the coupons, right? 😅 The biggest challenge has probably been how difficult it is to forecast work accurately. This won’t come as a surprise to anyone working on a technical product, but stuff always takes longer than you think. I had expected to finish this course in 3-4 months when in reality, it will have taken more than a year of full-time work. I’m reminded of Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take Hofstadter's Law into account. If you think something will take 2 weeks, so you give yourself 4 weeks, it’ll probably take 8 weeks. ",," It’s been a busy 6 months since the Early Access pre-launch! I’ve been spending the bulk of my time working on the course, filling in the last 5 modules. I’m also active in my course’s Discord, helping students who have been going through the course from the Early Access period. In the future, I don’t think I’ll do things this way. It’s a surprising amount of pressure to be on the hook for delivering something that people have paid for! I’d rather work with a small group of test students and open sales to the public once the course is fully completed. The flip side is that I’m not too worried about the launch in terms of revenue. The pre-launch has already funded the business for a few years, so any additional sales at this point are just frosting on the cake. Organizationally, the “team” is just me and a part-time couple-hours-a-week contractor who helps with general admin tasks (customer support, video captioning, etc.). My expenses are pretty low, probably about $1000 per month.  I’m not looking to grow too quickly I’m a fan of Paul Jarvis’ Company of One, and growth for growth’s sake isn’t something I’m interested in. For now, my focus is on creating a sustainable business for myself. Though I expect my ambitions will grow over the next couple of years! ",," So, I did a bunch of stuff wrong, at least according to the indie-hacker best practices. There are off-the-shelf course platforms I could have used, things like Teachable or Podia. The smart move might’ve been to pick one of them, but they weren’t sufficient for what I wanted to do. My vision was to create a rich, interactive course loaded with explorable examples and mini-games. So for the first couple of months, I focused on building the platform from scratch. The big benefit here is making the content interactive. This is an active course, not a passive thing where you sit back and watch videos.  It also meant I could customize the experience and make something unique and premium, and whimsical. For example, I’m pretty sure my course is the only one that celebrates your enrollment with live-animated fireworks. After those first couple months, I divided my time between content and platform. Once I had a couple of modules ready, I invited about 30 people to test-drive it. I offered free invitations to former students of mine, from when I taught a web-development bootcamp at Concordia University. I got some good feedback from this process, but it wasn’t really ideal the bootcamp alumni were busy in their job hunt, and because they hadn’t paid for the course, they weren’t really invested. They were checking it out as a favor to me, not because they were highly motivated to level up their CSS skills. Towards the end of 2020, I started building in public. I shared quick GIFs of things I was working on, previews of the content and the platform. I'm building my own course platform for my CSS course, because I want it to feature interactive minigames. Being able to tangibly play with concepts is the best way to build a working mental model / an intuition.I'm so excited 😄 pic.twitter.com/3LwuB5MGEh— Josh W. Comeau (@JoshWComeau) November 15, 2020
 ‍ This helped build some early traction, and I started covertly selling the course to people who had emailed me asking about it. I got a ton of valuable feedback this way. By January 2021, I realized that I was still nowhere near completing the course, so I planned an “Early Access” launch. This would essentially be a crowdfunding campaign for $129, people would get instant access to the first 5 modules, and they’d get to follow along with the course development. As I mentioned, I set what I thought was an aggressive target of $50k. I wound up hitting that mark in about 10 minutes. 😅 I only kept sales open for 1 week because I still had a ton of work to do finishing the course and knew that a constant drip of new students would divide my attention too much. By the end of the week, I had sold almost 5000 copies: It was a heck of a week. There were a bunch of technical issues (the downside of building your platform from scratch!), and I spent most of that week trying to catch up on an ever-growing mountain of support requests. It was stressful and exhilarating. Of course, people weren’t paying for a half-baked CSS course. So after taking a couple of days to breathe, I got back to work on the course. It’s currently August, and I plan to launch the course in full next month, on September 27th. ",," So in March 2020, right near the start of the pandemic, I injured my ulnar nerve. Frustratingly, I found I wasn’t able to type without pain. For several months, I could only type for a couple of minutes before my elbow would start burning. It was a tricky predicament to be in as a software developer! Fortunately, I was able to find a way to be productive without the use of my hands, and after about 8 months, I regained the ability to type. But the experience was harrowing, and it taught me a valuable lesson: life is short, and being able-bodied is temporary. I had been pretty happy working as a staff software engineer, but I wanted to create my own thing. I imagined myself following in the footsteps of Wes Bos or Kent C. Dodds, becoming a full-time educator. So over the summer of last year, I left my job at Gatsby Inc. and started work on CSS for JavaScript Developers! I chose to focus on CSS because I know so many JS developers who find CSS frustrating. Ask a typical React or Vue developer, and they’ll tell you that their least favorite part of the job is writing CSS. A lot of us really don’t like working with CSS 😅 CSS isn’t inherently bad, though! It’s a really elegant language. The problem is that it’s implicit. The rules of the language are concealed, and if you don’t understand those rules, you’re not going to have a good time. So the goal for my course is to change that relationship, to help folks realize that CSS can be a lot of fun! It’s a pretty lofty goal, but I wanted to pick something that would be high-impact and long-lasting. I’m excited by the prospect of helping developers realize the elegance of CSS and hopefully make it as fun for them as JavaScript is!"," So, super tactically: don’t do limited-edition coupons. The night before the prelaunch opened, I sent an email to the waitlist with a coupon for $20 off. It was limited to the first 50 people who used it. That coupon got used up in the first 90 seconds. It takes more than 90 seconds for an email broadcast to complete, so there were people who clicked the link the moment they got the email, only to discover that the coupon code didn’t work. Dozens of people emailed me telling me that the coupon was broken. Worse, about 50 people were shown that the coupon was successfully applied but later realized they were charged the total amount because the coupon expired in the seconds between when it was applied and when the checkout process was completed. I issued partial refunds for everyone affected, but it was chaos for those first couple of days.  More broadly, I think that the pre-launch was so successful because I have such a high-quality bar. It’s trendy in certain circles to ship quickly, start with a barebones MVP, and iterate. And while I do agree that perfectionism can be dangerous, I do think it’s worth spending the time required to make sure you’re delivering something solid.  It’s a nice idea to spend 2 weeks on a proof-of-concept to validate demand, but what if the only thing you’re validating is that people don’t want to buy something that only took you 2 weeks to build? If you’re doing something totally unprecedented, then this is probably a good idea. But if you’re following in the footsteps of successful businesses, as I was with Wes Bos and Kent C. Dodds, the demand is already validated. You just need to nail the execution. "," My primary strategy has been to be as helpful as I can be! Both because I enjoy being helpful and because it’s a great way to show folks what they’re getting with me. If I’ve helped you solve a problem in the past, you’ll be more likely to trust my course!

 ‍ I also have a blog, joshwcomeau.com. The blog posts are essentially “deep dive” versions of the tweets. They’re mainly on the topic of JS and CSS, though I have some posts about career and personal development. My goal in mid-2019 was to publish 1 post every 2 weeks. My nerve injury got in the way of that goal, but I’ve managed to publish about 60 posts since then. It gets between 60-90k unique visits a month, according to Google Analytics. When people visit my blog, they’re asked to join my newsletter. About 20k people have opted in so far. I have two other email lists managed with ConvertKit. I wrote a short book in 2020 focused on building a developer portfolio site. I self-published it and gave it away for free (though I do require an email address to send it to). About 12k people have downloaded the book.I created a waitlist for folks who wanted updates on my CSS course. About 11k people have signed up for that one. Email has been the most significant lever for me so far, and the only reason I have an email list is my blog. Twitter has also been helpful (responsible for about 14% of sales, according to the referrer), but email is king."," You can find me on Twitter at @joshwcomeau, learn more about my CSS course at css-for-js.dev, or check out my blog at joshwcomeau.com."," In terms of tooling, I don’t use a ton of services.

51,cuddli," I spent 13 years at Microsoft, working my way up from a technical writer to eventually running IT for, and reporting to the head of, Microsoft Research Asia while living and working in Beijing. When it was time to leave Beijing, I decided to leave Microsoft and go for an international MBA in The Netherlands. For part of the program, I was an exchange student at INCAE in Costa Rica where I took a class in entrepreneurship and venture capital. During the course of that class, I got really excited about the possibility of leveraging my software skills into a startup, and the plans for Cuddli began to take shape. I worked on Cuddli with the team until the end of 2016. We were extreme bootstrappers and kept Cuddli alive through sheer force of will, but it never found a large enough market. I currently work as a senior information security architect for the State of Washington. As it turns out, I learned a lot about security keeping users of our app safe. However, this was a limited time gig, it’s wrapping up, and the economy has apparently just collapsed amid a Coronavirus pandemic. I have my next role lined up after this (in theory), but ask me again in a few months whether it panned out or whether I’m even still alive. Also, if the airline industry ever becomes operational again (as I write this, global air traffic is heading toward a full ground stop), I help people book trips with their miles and points at my company AwardCat. "," Most startups fail because of founder infighting, running out of venture capital, or a failure to find product-market fit. We built Cuddli ourselves, and never took outside investment. We all remain good friends and have worked on other projects together. And we had an excellent product-market fit: we were the #1 app in our category, with over 100,000 users and creating thousands of beautifully geeky “Cuddli couples.”  So why did we give up, after four long, hard years of building a category-leading app (and after I invested my entire life’s savings)? We simply had no path to profitability or to exit, and we were all out of personal runway. We knew that we needed to either sell or close the app. Our core plan for monetization was clever, but incredibly difficult to execute because we were just too early. We integrated Foursquare into the app and built a date scheduler. Because we could prove that our users visited a physical location, we thought restaurants, bars, and other date spots would be excited to partner with us. The reception was lukewarm at best - these are businesses that operate on razor-thin margins so selling to them is tough, and getting paid is even tougher. If I had to do this over again, I’d partner with Airbnb and sell their experiences as date experiences (this wasn’t an option since Airbnb initially launched “Experiences” shortly before we shut down). We also sold custom digital stickers in the app, along the lines of LINE. We spent weeks and thousands of dollars building the functionality to do so, and I think we only ever sold 3 of them.   In the end, when we were looking to sell the app itself, nobody wanted to buy it except for spammers who would do terrible, unethical things with it. We were strongly values-driven (to the point that our values were on our front page), and put our money where our mouths were, refusing to sell to anyone who wouldn’t uphold them. We ultimately closed the app."," My biggest mistakes were (a) building the app based on a business model rather than an audience, (b) making a strategic error on the launch platform that cost us extremely valuable earned media, and (c) being the wrong CEO for the company. I already addressed (a) and (b) above, but being the wrong CEO for the company was very important learning. One thing that I think we did right is to build the company on a foundation of values and hold ourselves accountable to them. These were ours: Everything we do starts and ends with people.We always consider our users first.We are all team players.We are humble and self-critical.We communicate openly and honestly.We solve problems, not create them.We deliver on our promises. Following the values of communicating openly and honestly and solving problems, not creating them, we’d have very deep conversations. Bear in mind that Pinguino, Steve, and I have all known each other for over 15 years, and we were all good friends before we started Cuddli, so we were uniquely positioned to do this. But we were also all older, and I think this helped a lot--we were more mature. There was a point in the company where it became obvious that my marketing initiatives were gaining limited traction, Pinguino’s user acquisition initiatives were gaining considerable traction, and the most important thing our company needed to do was get users, not do MBA stuff with business models. I stepped aside as CEO and moved into a supporting role as COO and chairman of the board. Pinguino stepped up as CEO, and the fact that she did kept the company alive for another two years. ",,,," I went to visit my friend Steve in Croatia. We both grew up in the Seattle area but he fell in love with a Croatian girl and ended up moving there. We were talking about my relationship frustrations, the business idea, and the explosive growth of Tinder and we decided that we were going to build this thing. Top-notch mobile app developers were affordable in Croatia, Steve is a developer himself and he could write the back end server code, and our mutual friend Pinguino joined as the third co-founder two weeks later (she’s an amazing designer and as it turns out, also the best boss I have ever worked for). I started as CEO and later became COO, and took care of the business side of things.",," I wasn’t single when I moved to The Netherlands to start my MBA, but the relationship ended shortly after I relocated to Europe. I started using dating apps and the user experience was (and remains) incredibly frustrating. The basic business model of freemium dating apps (which is the vast majority of the market) is to introduce friction and charge users to remove it. This fundamentally puts the core interest of users (meeting people) at odds with the dating app’s business model. I thought there was a better way to build a dating app and started from a business perspective on the problem (by the way, this sounds logical but was a fundamental error). What if a dating app, in its very design, had aligned interests with the users? That was the fundamental principle in starting Cuddli: it started with a business idea (which I still think is a good one) and worked backward from that into finding a market, rather than starting with a motivated group of users and finding a workable business model from there. I also sought feedback from investors. They raised all sorts of (valid) problems with dating apps, such as the audience constantly changing, user churn (people had no reason to continue using an app after they met), etc. We solved for virtually all of these in the app design. "," It seems painfully obvious now, but there are two things that I will not do as an entrepreneur going forward. I won’t put in my own money. OK, I’ve broken this rule with AwardCat but that was a really cheap business to build. It cost me less than $3,000 in coding using a great team in Ukraine (I worked with them onsite in Kyiv), and it has made considerably more than that. If I were building a crazy high risk, venture-scale startup again, I’d raise venture capital or go home. Venture investors spread risk across a portfolio but founders only have one startup.I’ll get paid. Fundamentally, I need a place to live, enough to eat, and health insurance. I can get a tech job with approximately zero risks so if I start a startup, my “skin in the game” is the fact that I’m working more hours and making less money than another job. Living under a bridge (although fortunately it never came to that for me) is a truly massive distraction and startups require your full attention. "," We thought the app would sell itself. It was packed with amazing features that no other dating app had (there was no friction for users at all, every feature of the app was available for unpaid users), the design was incredible, and we threw a really great launch party in LA. We launched on Android first, since that had 90% of the mobile market at the time (everyone else was launching on iOS). We had, on a punch list, addressed every concern investors could possibly have about the sustainability of the business model. We honestly thought that the app was so well designed, so accessible, and removed so much friction that it would naturally take off. Our first indication that we’d made a really big mistake by launching on Android is when every single tech blogger and reporter who showed up at our launch party had an iPhone. Little did we know at the time that it’s really hard to grow the audience for a dating app. Earned media is almost essential, and I really blew it by deciding to launch on Android. This was an absolutely critical error, and we’d have saved ourselves a lot of time and money by just shutting down then.  Most dating apps are segmentation plays, and there is only room for a couple of market leaders who can take advantage of a technology shift. Unfortunately, Grindr, Tinder, and Bumble had been first to market on mobile and had captured the vast majority of broad-based audiences. All that was really left were segmentation plays. We also quickly discovered that we had almost nothing in common with mainstream audiences, so couldn’t create relatable marketing collateral for these audiences on our own. We’re all geeks, so what we did that eventually worked was to revert to our authentic selves. We tweaked the app to relate to geeks like us, and we started promoting the app in person to geek audiences at geek events like comic-cons and anime conferences. This truly resonated--we were a dating app by and for geeks. We started to get earned media coverage, became one of the top dating apps in Spain (for some reason, the app wasn’t in Spanish and we had never done any marketing there), and we literally created the category of geek dating apps, becoming the #1 app in the category. People loved our app so much that they asked us how they could help. We responded by sending them “Ambassador Packs” with a Cuddli T-shirt, flyers and stickers which they could distribute at their favorite geek spots to help Cuddli grow. Yes, users loved our app so much that they were literally doing work for free to help us grow. I’d like to say that our marketing was deliberate brilliance but we literally just made things up as we went along and doubled down on everything we found that was working. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a large enough category, which I’ll get to in the next section. ‍"," Here’s my current company, Award Cat. I also run a travel blog, which you can find here. You should also give a read to my article: “Is your unicorn really a shark?”."," I think the best people to learn from are other founders, at founder events. For example, WeAreLATech has an “experience club” where LA area founders can come together and enjoy an activity such as an escape room, but also have conversations with people who can uniquely relate. Be sure to get to know founders at different stages, not only early-stage founders. Later stage founders “pay it forward” a lot and they can be invaluable sources of information just bear in mind that they are busier than you. Some of the least valuable sources of information are venture capitalists. They are sharks--they’re smart, but they also have sharp teeth. One huge mistake I made was listening too much to the opinions of VCs and not (at least initially) finding people who could be potential users and talking to them. VCs say they care about profitability and business models, but what they really care about is the market size and exponential growth. They want to hit as close to the bottom of a hockey stick in growth as possible. They write and talk about what they want to publicly signal they’re investing in, but a lot of their advice only sounds good with the benefit of hindsight. Also, VCs who would never really invest in your business will still kick the tires and poke all sorts of holes in it. Those holes may be both entirely valid and also not even close to the most important thing to focus on. Some will even give you advice that is borderline unethical. Note that VCs who have invested in your company or who are personal friends are an entirely different breed. You’re part of their portfolio (or social circle) then, and your interests are (at least somewhat) aligned. An unaligned VC’s blog is an interesting data point but usually no more than that. I think that many tech entrepreneurs “pooh-pooh” business resources in the community that are super valuable. I teach a class on startups and entrepreneurship at a local college, which is informed by the very real experiences we had. You may find a former founder teaching a similar class at your local community college. The SBA hosts workshops for prospective entrepreneurs. This is a great way to meet other founders who you won’t be competing with and may even collaborate with. It’s also very much worth going to pitch competitions (here’s our pitch deck, btw) to see what other startups are out there, and what investors are currently most interested in funding (this isn’t to say that you should chase trends, only to gather intelligence). ‍"," We were extreme bootstrappers. To build the app and run it for 4 years, including all software development expenses, marketing expenses, hosting expenses, corporate filing (in two countries), etc. cost a bit less than $200,000. This is because we did all of the work ourselves, apart from coding the mobile apps (the server code was written by Steve, and in parallel, he worked with developers in Croatia who built the mobile apps based on Pinguino’s design).  But at what personal costs? I lived in a neighborhood so dangerous my neighbor was murdered. I was so poor that I qualified for Medicaid. I started to look at spaces under bridges and started seriously thinking “if I lived in a tent under there, I could extend my runway.” Pinguino’s relationship with her partner became strained from lack of income. Steve lived in a Soviet-era building where--I swear I’m not making this up--raw sewage was pouring from the ceiling during one visit. We all stretched ourselves to the limit--and then some--keeping the app afloat through sheer grit and determination if not outright lunacy. The app never made money and we lost everything we invested. ‍",Software & Hardware,Bad Business Model,United States,"May 20, 2020",Robert Walker,https://www.failory.com/interview/cuddli,"['https://www.award.cat', 'https://www.seat31b.com', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-unicorn-really-shark-robert-walker?articleId=5995668203617935360#comments-5995668203617935360&trk=public_profile_article_view']",failure,0,,"Robert was the co-founder of Cuddli, a dating app for geeks.

52,curiouscheck," Hey - So I’ll dive a little into my family background. My mother was born in Puerto Rico and my father was born in Switzerland. My friends actually used to call me Switzer-Rican during my childhood.  My father moved back to Switzerland when I was 4 years old and I’ve never been able to find him or hear from him ever again. I married my best friend Megan Crameri when I was 29. We have two amazing boys: Charlie (2 years old) and  Jack - (1-month-old).     Now, my professional background has always evolved technology in some sort of way. Even though I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice degree, I specialized in Cybercrime. This led me into the world of criminal data solutions, then to financial technology and now CuriousCheck.   CuriousCheck is not your typical business directory listing. We’re changing the game by providing a full-service advertising platform, where reputable business software can gain additional exposure and educate their target audience.  We provide a free listing where software and essential business services can sign up and showcase their products in a new way. Premium features, like National SEO, Video Ad creation, and more are available.  In addition, to be considered in our listing, businesses must have online reviews totaling 3.5 or higher to be accepted. This is because our reputation score is based on a combination of ALL reviews online. Yes, we aggregate all reviews so businesses can see a clear unbiased picture of the product and make the best possible choice.  For software shoppers that aren’t still sure what company to pick, we’ve added an additional service called our Advisor Tool. This interactive questionnaire accurately finds the best services for your company, based on your company size, industry, and a couple of industry expert questions in seconds.    ",," Obstacles?! Plenty. The most current obstacle we are all struggling to overcome- Corona. But before all of this, my main developers went out of business, I had to migrate servers multiple times, and my wife and I welcomed our second son. But CuriousCheck has persevered.  Our goal is still the same - to simplify and provide a platform for business advancement.  We bring transparency and knowledge to a space often overlooked, because people tend to stay stagnant in their way, regardless of how technology evolves.  We understand the thought of uprooting and starting over can be hard, but we make it as easy as possible and even exciting.  ‍  I don’t believe I had any great disadvantages at all. It’s what you do with the cards you’re dealt with.  My worst mistake was not researching how to have a React-based APP optimized for SEO. I now know that you must have middleware installed which provides a server-side framework. This simple mistake has delayed CuriousCheck’s domain reputation.  ",," One goal for the future is to be the #1 premier software and services finder for small businesses.  CuriousCheck wants to provide as many useful & affordable tools for business owners and executives globally, so time and money are not only saved but utilized at the fullest capacity. Partnering with the wrong business can cost you thousands of dollars and we want to make sure this does not happen to you, ever! Our second goal is to perfect our Advisor Bot and gain as much feedback as possible so we can start having it learn on its own with minimal human interaction. Currently, we use a scoring model based on industry, size, services, online reputation, and a few others. ",," I started in May of 2019 and partnered with a team of software developers that used to work for Zillow and Tesla.  They created a roadmap for my MVP (minimum viable product) and showed me the steps on how to scale.  While the MVP was 70% completed, the team had to close due to gaining too much work and unable to pay their vendors.  This caused a drastic delay and shift in mindset. I was actually able to gain one of their vendors they were working with and teamed up with them full time.  This team, after 3 months of delays, was able to get my MVP out in December 2019.  However, without my initial team I worked with, these developers did not create my MVP as planned and so CuriousCheck, a React web-app, was not built to be SEO optimized.  The developers I partnered with were backend developers, but were not pros in SEO, thus leaving a crucial part of the roadmap coding off.  Let me dive into the problem and make it as basic as possible. React-apps are Single-Page Applicants (SPAs). These apps consist of only one page that’s loaded once. All other information is dynamically loaded when necessary. Unlike typical multi-page apps, SPAs are quick and responsive however, you must take additional (expensive) steps to optimize SPAs or bots that will clump all the pages into one, omitting most of your content.  We initially tried the most common approach to solving this issue, which is pre-rendering. Pre-rendering are special programs that intercept requests to your site, and if a request is from a bot, pre-render sends a cached static HTML version of your website. If it’s from a typical user, the page is loaded as usual. When we created this program through prerender.io, the pre-rendering took too long due to the number of pages and some other factors.  After speaking to famous React consultants, we finally found out the only other way to solve the issue is to install new middleware for server-side rendering. This makes browsers and Google bots retrieve full content. The main issue with this was that this would take at least  2 months and $15-25k.  It all worked out because while trying to find a new more affordable solution, I met a talented developer on Linkedin that has now recreated 99% of my app on WordPress. He had to develop numerous custom plugins to have our site fully functioning and even faster than before.  What I would tell anyone building a React-based App is to make sure you add middleware and make a server-side framework for your app. Reach out to me if you have any questions.  As I explained, If you do not do this, your app will not be accurately fetched by Google accurately.  Don’t get me wrong, React-web-apps are great, other companies that have reportedly used React in their tech stacks, Airbnb, Uber, Hulu, Facebook, Netflix, Instagram, Twitter.  I’ve now learned my lesson and am helping as many people as I can to deal with this costly situation. On launch day, Jan 15th our team scheduled a successful Press Release through some great reputable companies. We were fortunate enough to gain some traction from the press release and receive additional publications with high traffic and high authority links.  After much feedback and the migration to WordPress, we’re relaunching April 15th.  I’ve tremendously enjoyed this journey and cannot wait to show the world what’s coming. ",," As I quickly talked about before, I graduated from Kennesaw State University (KSU) in 2010 with a degree in Criminal Justice/Cybercrime and was immediately hired as a full-time employee from my college internship at a Criminal Data provider. These are the companies that provide Criminal Data to investigators, background check companies, and more.  As I was always techy, the next year I was accepted to the Master’s program at Southern Poly State University (Now KSU) for Software Engineer. After a year I dropped out due to financial situations and YouTube being a better teacher than my professors.  After a decade, moving up into a managerial role, building a failing betting app, and then the birth of my first son later, I moved on to work for the soon to be 9th fastest growing tech company in North America, bringing in over $800,000 in sales monthly (while also having a couple of side-gigs). This is where I learned structure in selling to consumers, handling rejection, and most importantly, measuring and analyzing the right data to scale efficiently. In addition, the importance of online reputation management, SEO, and streamlining 3rd party lead generation tools.  In late 2018 I was given an opportunity to jump back into the HR field selling to enterprise companies at one of the most infamous background screening firms in the nation. Here I leveraged business trips and built as many relationships with successful business owners as possible. I learned the importance of strategic partnerships and started to mold myself into an industry leader.  Through my 2+ decades of experience working in multiple industries, startups, small and medium-sized businesses, I made sure to learn from their mistakes as well as what helped them overcome their biggest hurdles. This provided me a great path for success as well as an open mind to possible failures.  ‍",," Initially, my marketing strategy was: Grow my SEO and domain authority right off the bat, 3 months prior to our January 2020 launch, but due to the complications with my React-based app, as I mentioned previously, Google was unable to accurately locate my online content. On top of that, Google remained thinking my whole site was only one page.Bring in as many companies with a high online reputation into my platform as soon as possible. We partnered with over 80 businesses within the first 3 months and growing. Companies are ecstatic to join a modern business directory listing that’s actually dedicated to helping them grow. For the businesses lacking online reviews or having too many negative reviews, we provide review management. This is where we help create a strategic roadmap to implement and drastically increase the percentage of reviews from their clients, partners, and vendors. Many companies, especially in unique niches like Background Screening, simply believe that only pissed off customers leave reviews, which is far from the truth. They just simply don’t understand how to have a proper plan for review management.Educating the audience on real essential business software, by creating an intelligent and interactive advisor bot that provides your company’s top software service choices in seconds.

Reach out directly to businesses through Linkedin and Instagram and advise them for free on Software or Services that may be of use to them. For instance, advice on the best Chatbots for their industry, top Press Release companies, and the ideal payment processing companies with much lower rates than PayPal and Stripe.  We are receiving a lot of traction from small businesses. Most people don’t know exactly what type of software they need, if it’s compatible with their industry or if it’s the most affordable solution. Since the most recent study shows 94% of people don’t search past the first page of Google, this leaves off thousands of great companies to choose from. We’ve gone ahead and not only made software shopping simple, we’ve combined the reviews from all top review sites into each software profile. Here you can easily read reviews from the Better Business Bureau, Trustpilot, Google, Capterra, and much more.  Our goal is to provide as much transparency to shoppers so they can make the perfect choice for their business.   ‍", Learn more by connecting and engaging with my personal account on Linkedin. Feel free to schedule a call.  Some places to learn is our blog and our IG provides inspiration as well as tips on affordable software alternatives and SEO advice.," To tell you the truth, I don’t read books at all anymore. I simply don’t have the time.   I recommend trying to put yourself in your customers as well as your vendor’s shoes.  Follow the hashtags they follow, engage with them, ask them questions through Linkedin, Instagram, Twitter, or even Alignable (a great underground small business platform). Become a leader in your space, get to know people at their level, and build a relationship not based on a possible sale, but based on trust and support.  For SEO advice, I follow the source: SEM Rush Academy and blog, Moz, Diib, and Neil Patel. In fact, I was consulted by Neil Patel’s team on SEO for quite some time and learned a ton. However, it’s extremely expensive. Along with working with the 9th fastest growing tech company, working with Neil Patel’s group pushed me to go full-speed with SEO as soon as possible. ‍ For general business, I follow Gary Vaynerchuk, The Hustle Newsletter, and Chris Do. Going to interviews. In 2019 I applied to hundreds of companies and went to at least 50-60 interviews. Most of the time, I didn’t even have a goal of getting hired, I simply wanted to go directly to the owner and ask them their story. How did they become profitable and what steps are they doing to maintain profitability? You see, I think it’s extremely important to learn and ask questions, especially to those that have the answers. Through this time, I learned so many different channels within each industry and unique useful software that it literally blew my mind.

53,delite," Hi, my name is Pat Walls and I am a Software Engineer living and working in New York City. Right now, I am working on Starter Story, a website where I interview entrepreneurs on how they got started, similar to Failory!  In October 2016, two friends and I built Delite, a SaaS platform for B2B wholesale orders, which ultimately failed. ‍"," There were a few problems with Delite, in no particular order: ‍ SCOPE The scope of Delite was too big. The product was too ambitious. We tried to enter the world of B2B sales, which is a big market with a lot of complexity. One customer was looking for a possibly very different solution than another.   NOT PRACTICAL Delite was a really cool product. It was a new way of doing B2B sales. Unfortunately, it did not really fit in how these companies work today. B2B sales are manual and personable. Salespeople are making sales over the phone, exchanging tons of emails, making special deals under the table, etc.   TIME My co-founders didn’t have enough time to work on the business. We all had full-time jobs, so we were free to work on Delite on nights and weekends. That would have been fine, but all of our customers worked 9 to 5. So that means we had to jump on sales calls, answer emails, and do customer support while we were at our day jobs. I had to leave work almost every day and go to a coffee shop and take some sort of phone call. This was really stressful and it wasn’t possible for us to do that in the long term unless we quit our jobs.   NECESSITY Delite was a “nice-to-have” for our customers. You know that thing in your life that you keep putting off, you know you need to do it, but it can wait? That was Delite for our customers. They knew they needed something like this in the future, but it’s something they are putting off to another day to implement because they were very busy.   REPLACING CORE PART OF THE BUSINESS Sales and order management is core to our customers business. Using our product would change the way they operate in a lot of ways. It’s a lot of work to move to a new technology or learn how to use a new one.   TARGET NICHE Our niche was not technology focused. We were selling to people that were bad with technology. Although that can be a huge benefit because it’s an open market of new customers, it also means they are really hesitant and need a lot of hand-holding. We had to have multiple sales calls and demos with each customer to convince them to use the product, and teaching them how to use the product was extremely time-consuming.   FEATURES We did not have enough features, and we didn’t have any integrations with other software. A lot of customers want it to “just work” with Quickbooks, and about every other platform they have.   USAGE & RETENTION Once we got users signed up and onboarded, we noticed that actual usage was low. They weren’t really using the product.",," To be honest, we didn’t really have any direct competition. The key feature of our product, ability to send wholesale order forms with no login, did not really exist at the time. Our target niche also typically didn’t have any technology they used for this process other than manual email. You could compare us to some more enterprise solutions like Handshake and other wholesale management platforms, but our software was aimed at a smaller customer and had simpler features. ‍",,," My roommate had the idea to build Delite in late October 2016. He owns his own business selling pet products and sells his products to hundreds of different retailers. The process of getting orders and invoicing all of those retailers was really time-consuming for his business. He wanted the ability to send all of these businesses a secure web form where they could fill out their orders automatically without having to log in or anything. We called the company Delite and came up with the idea to create “delites”: customizable order forms that you could send to your customers. I am a software engineer and he also knew how to code. We started building the product immediately. It took us about two months to build the MVP, which was basically the ability to create “delites” and send them to your customers, where they could fill out the orders and pay with a credit card. We then spent about four months getting customers and adding features. We applied to Y Combinator and got to the video interview stage, but got rejected. We didn’t quit because of the YC rejection, but it was coincidentally the point where we evaluated the business and decided to shut it down.  ",,," Building Delite was an amazing learning experience and I don’t regret anything. It was the most fun professional experience I’ve ever had. But in a completely hypothetical situation, this is what I would do differently. ‍ Find 5 or 10 customers willing to pay before building the product: Get them interested and get their input on what they need. I would hack together prototypes as fast as possible using Typeform and do a lot of manual work behind the scenes. ‍ We would have charged money for Delite from the beginning, and charged more than we “thought it was worth”: We wanted to give away our product for free to our first customers. In B2B, a free product signals a bad product and you look desperate if you offer it for free. And if you think it’s worth $50/month, charge $100/month. ‍ More cold calling and have a better marketing approach: We were all over the place in our marketing, sometimes doing full days of cold calling and emailing, but never really following up multiple times and having a “real” sales process. ‍  First of all, if you have an idea, just try to build it. Sit down for a day and try to hack something together. You don’t have to know how to code to do that. You can use tools like Typeform and Webflow to build real applications. If you’re reading this, you’re already doing it right. It probably means you are interested in entrepreneurship and starting your own business. Never before has it been easier to start your own app, brand, business, etc. You don’t need VC funding anymore to create a technology company. Sites like Failory, Hacker News, IndieHackers, Product Hunt, etc are creating a revolution in entrepreneurship and lifestyle. Just try to soak everything in and make sure you are always on the creating side of it. Work on an idea that you are passionate about. I’m passionate about building apps and starting companies, but I wasn’t passionate about the idea behind Delite or the problems that Delite was solving. After our YC interview, I lost the motivation to keep working on it. I wonder if I would have kept going if I really believed in the idea. Find something that can work for your schedule. Everyone has a different situation. For me, I have a full-time job so I now know that I should focus on something where I can move the needle on nights and weekends. That’s why I started Starter Story. Not only am I passionate about entrepreneurship, but I can put in serious work on nights and weekends and get a lot done! ‍"," Once we finished the MVP, we thought it would be pretty easy to get people to start using the app. Turns out that was a lot harder than we thought. Our target customer was small to medium businesses, such as a small scale manufacturer that did most of their product sales in-house. We started in the niche of pet products. We chose that niche because one of my co-founders was well connected in that industry, and a lot of businesses were not currently leveraging much technology. We built a list of potential customers based on anyone we could think of. We started cold calling/emailing these customers. Responses were pretty low, but we ended up acquiring a few customers. The sales process was long for each customer, including multiple emails, sales calls and live demos of the product. We came up with some unique ways to get new customers. We went to a “health food” trade show in San Francisco and handed out personalized business cards, getting many leads and a few customers that way. We also found another trade show attendee list and email blasted everyone on the list, like 1000 people. We got a few customers that way too.  In a couple months, we had acquired about 5-10 customers who were willing to try us out.", Starter StoryTwitter, Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth is awesome. ‍,,Software & Hardware,No Market Need,United States,"March 17, 2018",Patrick Walls,https://www.failory.com/interview/delite,"['http://www.starterstory.com/', 'https://twitter.com/starter_story']",failure,0,,Delite was a SaaS platform for B2B wholesale orders.

54,deluxemaid," My name is Finn Pegler and I run a local cleaning company in Indianapolis called DeluxeMaid. I am 31 years old and run the entire business remotely from London, England. The main difference between my cleaning company and others is that everything can be booked online in just 60 seconds. Pricing is intuitive and based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms so there is no need for us to visit every house to quote, which would of course be difficult all the way from England! We do have management teams in Indianapolis but they do not visit homes to quote either. I work with a fantastic team of VAs from around the world who handle all day to day operations while I focus on more of the big picture stuff and help to refine company policies on a daily basis. ‍",," Customer service is definitely something I struggled with in the beginning. I was not used to dealing with angry customers especially when I saw their complaints as unreasonable. Over time I learned that it was best to ‘take the hit’ on these types of customers as they are not worth stressing over. Moreover, if a dissatisfied customer leaves a bad review online it will likely cost the company future revenues far in excess of refunding a partially refunding a customer. It’s important to leave your ego at the door in the service industry and act in the best interest of your business at all times.",," Business is better than ever in spite of Covid slowing us down for a few months in the middle of 2020.

I own three smaller cleaner companies in Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Milwaukee, and they are also run remotely.  ‍",," The idea came from a Reddit thread by Rohan Gilkes which explained step by step how to set up a local service company. The beauty of it was how quickly everything could be done and in just 27 days I created my own cleaning company and had my first customer after about 45 days. The first step was to pick a location that had a lot of potential. I decided to go with Indianapolis as it had a metro population of about 1 million and at the time not many house cleaning companies (none which offered flat rate prices and online booking in under a minute). Obviously, big markets like New York, Chicago, or LA were tempted but it may have been harder to penetrate the markets there.",," Before setting up DeluxeMaid, I was part of the ESTEEM graduate program at the university of Notre Dame. The program focussed on bootstrapping businesses and removed obstacles I previously thought would be impossible to overcome when setting up a business. I previously thought substantial investment would be required to even get the business off the ground but the ESTEEM program taught how much easier it was to just set something up to see if it stuck. Interestingly, I didn’t go straight from ESTEEM to running DeluxeMaid and initially worked as an engineer at a large motor company. I left the job after less than a year just a few months after setting up DeluxeMaid. The company was only generating around $1k monthly revenues at the time but I was determined to make a real go of it and give it my full attention. I pretty much hated my engineering job and I figured it was better to be at the bottom of a ladder I wanted to climb rather than be halfway up a ladder I had no interest in. ‍",," Initially, I used Facebook, Craigslist, and Thumbtack but the long-term strategy was very focussed on SEO and improving our visibility on Google. SEO can take a few years before seeing a ROI but it is now by far our most successful channel. 90% of our revenue is now through SEO traffic. We found that PPC had a negative ROI for us. The CPC for the keywords in our area was quite high and we were converting very few of these clicks. PPC can be great in some industries but we found it ineffective. ‍", You can find out more about my house cleaning business on our website. ," Slack is how we communicate on a daily basis. We have different channels for each important area of the business e.g #hiring #procedures #schedule. I enjoy reading books about goal orientated entrepreneurs. Two books I’d recommend are Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture and the Elon Musk biography. They both focus on the importance of having ambitious goals and setting deadlines. This recently inspired me to create a new project for the cleaning companies called ‘Operation 200k’. The goal of which is to have a combined 200k monthly revenue across the cleaning companies by July 2021. It will be difficult to get but it is always good to have ambitious goals for your business, as even if you fall short you’ll still hopefully have seen substantial growth. ‍",,Services,,United States,"February 24, 2021",Finn Pegler,https://www.failory.com/interview/deluxemaid,['http://deluxemaid.com'],success,1,$25k-$100k/mo,"Finn had a typical engineer job.. but he hated it.

55,dick-at-your-door," Hey Failory! My Name is actually Adam and I am the owner of Dick At Your Door. I started this company just over three years ago after spending the last seven years in various sales and marketing jobs. For the most part, I had worked with early-stage startups in the tech industry. I had met so many people in that world I believed weren’t up to snuff on motivation, education, and/or skills. Not to say I’m any kind of a genius. In fact, I’m far from that (re: 2.7GPA in high school and an art degree). I do understand how to work hard and learn from other people’s mistakes. I also know how to read. I was dirt poor so didn’t have much to lose when it came to financial repercussions if I failed (it also meant I had nothing to invest - low expectations). Basically, I had the itch to start something of my own and see what could happen. I’ll be the first one to tell you chocolate dicks were not on the radar back then. Dick At Your Door started when a buddy found a silicone penis mold at a random sex shop on a cross-country drive (thank you Lincoln, Nebraska). My buddy and I thought it would be hilarious to send chocolate dicks in the mail to our friends. Disclaimer: It was hilarious. We eventually threw up a website to continue the prank and people started reaching out that weren’t our friends. That was the lightbulb moment for us. From there it was perfecting the molding process, finding a real chocolatier (and eventually becoming chocolatiers ourselves), building a secure website that was legit and going forth into the world of dicks and chocolate making. ‍",," Our single biggest challenge was (and continually is), finding and reaching the correct people who are prepared to take action on our products and services.  We were a “business” for two years before we found any type of traction anywhere.  We were so slow for a number of months in the beginning that we simply stopped updating anything.  I would stop paying attention to the site entirely until an order came in, get reinvigorated and write some content, do some outreach, etc,  get discouraged, and stop paying attention. That cycle was on repeat through the first two years. We finally broke through with a feature in Huffington Post.  I had been bugging this comedy writer-at-large at daily for a couple of weeks until she finally gave up and featured our product.  That was our “big break” (read: we saw this could be something profitable and real).  From that article, we received something like 30 orders which gave us some cash flow to play with. I rolled that into a marketing budget and we were off to the races...so to speak. Of course, there are also always challenges with summer seasons.  We are a delivery chocolate service.  High temperatures mean melted chocolate and people who are none too pleased. Our solutions are always a work in progress.  However, we have minimized melting by shipping more quickly, shipping in thermal envelopes designed to keep contents cool, and including ice packs during the hottest times of the year. We still get a good handful of melty dick emails though.  We can’t control someone who leaves a package in the direct sunlight in Atlanta for three hours in July.  Just going to have to roll with the punches and understand that will happen. ‍  Our single biggest mistake has been underestimating our audience. We honestly never believed this would have been something to be successful. it was always just two friends having fun messing with our friends. That means we went far too long not having a good email list built, no marketing, no real work went into building the foundations of the company. If I had to do it all over again, I would start with a solid website, strong email list builder, and bigger outreach to prospective audiences. I would have gone after more social platforms (Twitter, FB, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, etc) to gain the audience we were looking for. Behind those early days mistakes, I would have invested in the chocolate making process much sooner. We spent a couple years bootstrapping all our equipment which proved to be much more expensive (in the long run) and time-consuming. ‍",,," Biggest disadvantages have always been the size of our niche. Being an e-commerce company, we rely solely on the people that we are getting in front of. If no one is searching for what we are offering and we can’t find ways to market to the people who don’t know they need to buy a chocolate dick, we are sunk. Novelty products such as ours are very reactionary.  That means, people don’t necessarily wait to purchase our products.  99% of our customers saw a funny meme with a chocolate dong or a reaction video featuring our products and pulled the trigger immediately. That’s why most of my time is simply outreach and making sure people are even aware this type of product exists.  We are constantly finding new channels to pursue with our advertising and marketing.  Along with that, we have to understand that each social platform is constantly updating and changing.  Many times, we are just cracking the code to an algorithm update when it is updated again.  It’s a constant battle. Being a small business means we have a smaller budget than most of our competitors/novelty products services.  The Google Adword struggle for top the position is REAL. "," What started as a joke quickly became a viable business with real opportunity. When we first created our product, it was down and dirty. Just a couple of dudes in the garage melting Hershey chocolate and pouring it into a cheaply made silicon mold of a penis. Looking back to those first days, it was never even in our mind to create a business around chocolate, let alone chocolate dongs. It was always just a funny prank to pull on our friends. Slowly, sales started building. In the beginning, it was a very crude design. A straight black box, a stamp we had custom made, some paper mache to avoid broken chocolate, and a handheld plastic melter to wrap the box. I remember the first time we had 10 orders to fulfill at once. It was a disaster. Took almost 4 hours. It was frustrating and very much not worth our time. Nowadays, we can package and mail 500 orders in the same amount of time. The boxes are custom and ordered in bulk, and we are officially professional chocolatiers. It’s been a long road, and to be honest, I don’t know why we stuck with it. Call it a fun experiment I guess? ‍",,," I would have immediately started making chocolate myself. We spent so much time and energy finding a supplier and a manufacturer who would produce our chocolates. This eventually led to us realizing it was much more efficient to become chocolatiers ourselves. From there, we have been able to teach and train the right people to help grow our business from within, rather than from delegating outside our walls. ‍"," We work on creating strong content that is centered around the business of chocolate, pranks, gags, and novelty products. It is a very small niche, so there is a lot that goes into becoming the top-ranking company that sells chocolate novelties. Fortunately, my business partner understands how to set up a website to optimize so we get the most out of the time spent building content. Things like tagging, alt text, thought out page names, and sharing across multiple platforms has really helped us grow into a viable company. Secondly, we rely on outreach. I spend around 30 hours per week just banging the phones and sending out emails to potential press connections, marketing opportunities, or other companies that may be interesting in what we have going on. It’s very much like your typical sales job in that I am working every day to expand my product to a larger audience. Lastly, this product is viral in nature. People think it’s funny to post about sending a chocolate penis to someone in the mail. Because most people are not sending it to themselves, we always include an offer code and a way to get to our site in every order. It is a literally a direct marketing campaign paid for by our customers.", You can check our website.

56,dotahaven," Hello there and thanks for the invite to do this interview! I’m Kyril Kotashev, I’m 29 years old, from Bulgaria, and I’m the founder of DotaHaven. It is a gaming/esports content website with a SaaS in it that aimed to provide content creators and influencers in its niche an additional way to monetize. Our startup is in the process of joining the ranks of the failed projects. Even though the website is still online (people are still reading some of the content), we’re leaving it on auto-pilot for the foreseeable future and moving onto other projects. Our concept didn’t deliver good-enough results and we’ve just decided to stop active work on it. So, I’m currently in a period of introspection, not working on anything actively. I’m organizing my head, the ideas I have, and the many lessons from my experience so far as well as looking forward to new challenges and projects in the near future. ‍"," A biology professor (Bret Weinstein) used to bag all the dead animals his cat brought home and put them in his freezer. At some point he made his graduate students autopsy the animals, and what they found was that the majority of the cat victims (I believe he said two-thirds) had additional health problems. In other words, most of these animals were more susceptible to death by a house-cat than their peers because of their additional health issues.  As we know, the same is true for coronavirus victims. A young, healthy person usually manages to deal with the virus. However, a person with comorbidities and a compromised immune system is at a much greater risk. I strongly believe the same principle applies to businesses. Few businesses fail due to a single factor. Usually, some kind of stress coming from the environment puts the final nail in the coffin, but it only manages to do so because the business already had serious underlying problems. In our case what killed the business was that the trend we were riding (the new Auto Battler game genre and the Dota Underlords video game) died out. The important underlying issue, however, was that we had exhausted most of our resources developing a service before we had validated the need for its existence. This left the business with not enough room to breathe to properly pivot and test new concepts & strategies, business models, etc.  ‍"," Again, the biggest mistake by far was that we spend >80% of our resources developing something very few people needed. I was aware of the concept of the lean startup, but I didn’t know how to put it into practice and how you can take it to an extreme in order to improve the chances of finding the elusive product-market-fit. IMO the most important thing for a startup by far is to be lean and agile. It seems to me that if you fail at any of the two you’re very likely to waste your time and money, as we did. You need to be able to challenge, test, and if required change your assumptions as cheaply as possible in order to give yourself the best chance to find the right approach. It’s wise to start serious investments in development and marketing only after you have tangible evidence you’re on the right path. Besides that, there were many other problems, mistakes, and learning experiences along the way. For example, I’d avoid doing another startup as a solo founder. I think a co-founder is extremely beneficial. I’d also avoid doing another startup without a mentor. That said, I don’t think those are true for everyone – they are negotiable, case-specific, and they have pros and cons. Being lean and agile, however, is simply non-negotiable. There are no downsides besides the fact that it requires more effort on the side of the founder(s), but this is well worth the increase in the chances of success.",,,," Wrote a business plan, built a detailed wireframe, and started fundraising. Eventually, I managed to raise $90k from a few local business angels that were interested in the niche. I was successful in fundraising mostly because I used my experience from the 1st startup and the new developments in the market niche (new competitors making money) as proof that we have a good chance to be successful in the niche ourselves. I am not a developer and didn’t have a technical cofounder, so we decided to outsource the dev. process. We partnered up with a small local software company that we trusted and started work on the platform. Meanwhile, I started gathering a team of freelancers to work on the content with me. The site went live after 6-7 months of work behind curtains. At first glance, all of the above seems in order, but people with a bit more experience would have noticed that in the last sentence hides our most fatal mistake. More on that below.",," Stubbornness, mostly. In my last year at university, I got invited to work as the main content guy of a gaming/esports startup. We partnered up with one of the biggest esports teams in the world at that time (Na’Vi) and created the first premium educational platform for the Dota 2 video game. Long story short, the startup showed promise but was ultimately unsuccessful due to lack of funding and most importantly – mismanagement caused by our total lack of experience. The founder of said startup eventually quit, but I wasn’t ready to give up because I saw a lot of potential. I wanted to make something useful out of all the knowledge I had accumulated from the project. And on a deeper, personal level – fear. I was terrified by the thought that I might have to find a traditional job. I had an MSc in Finance, so the local big banks were my most likely employer. Yet, every time I went into a bank branch, the atmosphere of soul-crushing bureaucracy haunted me. Accepting a job there seemed like death to me. I was clinging to the idea of working on this startup as a drowning man clings to a piece of floating wood. Not because I wanted to be rich or famous or anything, but because I wanted to make a living out of something interesting and stimulating to me on a day-to-day basis to keep my soul alive. So – stubbornness and fear. The most inspirational of motivations.  (P.S. I’ve grown a bit wiser now and am aware that first, not all 9-to-5 jobs are soul-crushing, and second - there are many ways one can keep their soul alive even in a not-that-stimulating 9-to-5 job. Third, the idea of working on something you’re passionate about is a bit romantic and divorced from reality, but that’s a different topic and I’m struggling to avoid writing a 5k word essay on each one of your questions.) ‍"," I’d put the initial investment in a bank account.I’d find a co-founder if possible, and we’ll spend a good amount of time experimenting with no-code solutions and different kinds of content while the only major expense is our salaries.We’d start investing in proper development and marketing only after we’ve had a successful validation experiment and our no-code MVP is gaining some traction. ‍"," We started with an email marketing campaign. Then, we experimented with small ad campaigns on Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Reddit.  We got visitors on the website, but 1st, they weren’t converting, and 2nd, they weren’t coming back. It became obvious that the problem wasn’t in the marketing campaigns, sadly, but in the service we were selling. We weren’t the only providers of premium educational content in our niche anymore, and our strategy for differentiation (eCommerce model instead of SaaS, different partners/influencers) wasn’t successful. Very few people were interested in what we were offering. There was no product-market-fit. (The lesson here is that investing any money in paid promotion is generally speaking a waste before you’ve established a product-market fit. Paid promotion is a growth expense, and we were still in the validation phase, not in the growth phase.) We realized that we had to pivot. Even though we had invested very little resources in the promotional campaigns above, we had invested a lot in the development of the platform and the premium content in it, which meant the startup was in a bad place. We changed the business model to a traditional subscription model and at the same time changed our strategy: rather than focusing on the value to the end-consumer of the educational content, we were trying to find a model in which we create value for our content-creator/influencer partners as an additional source of income. At the same time we started an organic content marketing strategy (I talk about it in detail in this content marketing case study for those of you interested). The pivot was ultimately unsuccessful (sadly, we didn’t have the resources to test the new concept properly), but the new strategy brought new visitors and the website was growing: We used this positive trend to secure an advertising contract to keep the business alive and we were positioning ourselves for a third pivot. Sadly, the trend we were riding to grow (a new video game genre) died out and with it - our traffic started falling. This made the business unsustainable and landed us where we are at right now. ‍"," Before wrapping this up, I’ll allow myself to tell yet another somewhat unrelated but hopefully interesting story: When you invited me to do the interview I, naturally, checked out the Failory website. I started listening to your latest podcast (at the time) with Bernard Huang from Clearscope. The name sounded very familiar, and then a friend of mine reminded me that years ago we used to write some Dota 2 content for his Game Runners website/startup as freelancers. Now, we live half the world apart from each other (I’m in Eastern Europe, Bernard is in the US, and my friend is currently in Japan), and yet our paths have intersected again randomly. This gave me a profound realization that even though the world is huge, the startup community - less so, and in a way, we are all walking on this path together. The best we can do is try to learn from each other and whenever possible – help each other. Startups are not a zero-sum game. The more we support each other, the more value we’ll create for ourselves and the rest of the world. If you want to follow my story and learn from my mistakes, the best place to do so would be my blog on Medium where I occasionally post stories like my 5 Lessons from 2 Failed Startups. If you’re into social media, the blog has my other links."," Before giving you a list, I must mention that I avoid motivational, life-coach-style, this-is-the-way-to-become-rich resources like the plague. Moreover, I strongly believe that domain knowledge is way more important than knowledge about entrepreneurship. I try to consume (professional) content on two levels: First, I get high-level, broader startup and entrepreneurship lessons mostly from the stories of other entrepreneurs. I treat Paul Graham’s blog like the Startup bible, and I have been deeply influenced by the thoughts of people like Sahil Lavingia, Jason Fried, and many others. That said, I prefer long-form blog posts/articles, podcasts, and the occasional book. I don’t believe reading Tweets will make you a better entrepreneur in any way (Twitter is just useful to keep track of what these people are up to). I must mention that I’ll definitely add failory.com to my list of resources I visit – it’s a great way to find the stories of the not-so-famous members of the startup community. Second, I try to develop useful practical skills that I can apply in the projects I’m a part of. In my case, this is content marketing, especially SEO. I’ve learned plenty from the Ahrefs’ Blog and the writings of Nat Eliason. This is useful only if you want to get into content marketing and SEO, however. ‍"," Our expenses were: Salaries (initially a team of 3, then only mine).Platform development expenses (outsourced to a software dev firm).The fees of the freelancers who helped with the content.A whole bunch of other minor stuff (servers, a few PCs, etc.) All in all, we managed to spend about $125k over two and a half years, with the majority being spent in the first 6-7 months while we were developing the platform and content behind closed doors. Our revenue: About $35k advertising income. Most coming from the one-on-one advertising partnership we entered, a smaller part from the automatic ads from a display ads network.And an insignificant amount from the actual SaaS we were trying to get going. If I draw the line right now we lost about $90k (the initial funding), but it’s worth mentioning that the website is still online, has traffic, and we haven’t made an attempt to liquidate the assets of the business yet (this decision remains to be taken) to mitigate some of the losses. ‍",Entertainment,Bad Market Fit,Bulgaria,"June 10, 2020",Kyril Kotashev,https://www.failory.com/interview/dotahaven,"['https://www.failory.com/podcast/bernard-huang', 'https://medium.com/@KyrilKotashev/how-i-grew-my-gaming-blog-from-0-to-500k-monthly-pageviews-in-6-months-72f97f32514', 'https://medium.com/@KyrilKotashev/5-lessons-from-2-failed-startups-fda090d9b278']",failure,0,,"Kyril is the founder of DotaHaven, a gaming content site that’s currently passing away.

57,dream-client-academy," Hey everyone ! My name is Alex Albarran, I’m 21 years old and the founder of Dream Client Academy. We’re a consulting firm based in Hollywood, Florida. Dream Client Academy is a company dedicated to unlocking rapid growth for client-businesses. We do this through marketing consulting services & training programs. I bootstrapped the company and have grown it from $0 to $31K in monthly revenue (as of February 2020). My current role as Founder/CEO has evolved into focusing mainly on business development, product development, managing our team members, and client-retention. ‍",," The biggest challenge I faced as an entrepreneur wasn’t the marketplace, my clients, prospects or a difficult Facebook ads campaign. It was my own mindset. Developing the mental toughness/grit to handle the inevitable obstacles, challenges and difficulties of entrepreneurship. Forcing myself to get rid of the “scarcity” mindset ( don’t take risks and seek safety ), and develop a “growth” mindset ( take calculated risks and get out of your comfort zone ). Developing the confidence to not listen to naysayers & doubters ( especially people around me who told me to go get a safe job ). Not quitting even when things weren’t going well. Having the patience to think long-term and delaying gratification.   I would say that one of our greatest disadvantages is the fact that our industry is getting over-saturated with low-quality consultants/service-providers.  We have many of our prospective clients tell us that they’ve had very bad experiences with consultants, which makes them skeptical of working with another one.  We counteract this by putting extra attention on building trust/credibility with our prospects as well as having a fantastic background of social proof. The mistake I made in the beginning of this business was not investing enough back INTO the business. That limited our growth greatly at first and it took me time to mature & understand the necessity of investing back into the company for long-term growth. ‍",," We're seeing consistent growth in key areas such as. Roughly $100k in new deals for Q1 of 2020.Return on ad spend is at 7X.New testimonials/case studies coming from clients multiple times per week. The macro/long-term vision for the firm is to work with Fortune 500 brands and grow to $2M/month in revenue. I'll be laying the ground-work for that over the next 7-10 years by establishing our credibility/reputation, retaining clients for the long-term through amazing customer-service & generating undeniable results, growing my personal brand as the head of the company, building an infrastructure to handle clients at the large corporation-level, slowly but surely working with larger & larger clients and ultimately leveling-up as an entrepreneur & business-operator. ‍",," I was handling EVERYTHING by myself at first, including sales, business development, client-fulfillment, billing, content marketing, etc…  While this limited my ability to grow at first (as there's only so much one person can do), it gave me an understanding of how each key sub-system of the business worked which has helped me greatly in terms of being able to clearly communicate what I expect from my team members. The entire first full-time year of being in business is when I was figuring out all of the foundational aspects of the company. From what verticals/niches we should work with, how to structure our offers, how to generate new business, what services we should offer etc… It was very difficult & lonely at times as I was on the journey alone, lacked clarity on many key aspects of the business, and was struggling to consistently generate revenue. I wouldn’t say the process was enjoyable or unenjoyable as a whole. There were good & bad moments throughout the process, but I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing today if I quit when it got difficult.  What also helped was making an effort to NOT overestimate what I could do in 9-12 months while NOT underestimating what I could do in 9-12 years. Our initial offers/packages were vastly-underpriced which also limited our growth potential/ceiling.  Think about it like this, if you’d like to grow a consulting business to $15k per month in revenue, would you rather have: Roughly 37-38 Clients @ $400/Per Month Each ClientRoughly 7-8 Clients @ $2,000/Per Month Each Client Just the simple concept of raising our prices helped us attract higher-quality clients and generate more revenue. Higher prices attracted higher-quality clients AND weeded out the cheaper/headache-filled clients. Higher-quality clients don’t want to get the $0.99 lobster special.  They’ll pay a premium for something/someone that delivers great results.",," When I graduated high school, I launched a healthy meal delivery/catering company (called “Slim Pickins Meals”) from my parent’s kitchen. This was my first “real” business operation where I learned about things like payroll, overhead, COGS, delegation, marketing/sales KPIs + much more. ‍ I eventually moved into a commercial kitchen space as I outgrew my parent’s home kitchen (and they wanted their kitchen back on the weekends). While I was running that company, I started helping other business owners at my church run social media advertising campaigns as I had built up a solid knowledge base from managing advertising campaigns for my own company. It started out as very part-time but organically grew to the point where my consulting business was generating more profit than my catering company. I then eventually decided to shut down the catering company so I could focus on growing my consulting company full-time. I came to this decision in part because of the low-overhead business model that the consulting company offered, the improved work/life balance, and my strengths as an entrepreneur aligned more with this business. "," I would tell my former self to relax, stay patient, keep working hard and everything will work out. It’s so easy to seek instant gratification and to push for positive growth to happen very quickly. However that can lead to people taking shortcuts, which will lead to mistakes. I wish I would’ve spent more time on sales/business development in the beginning instead of content/social media.  A business doesn’t run off of likes & comments, it runs off of revenue & sales. I’ve found that auditing what you’re doing every hour of every day is great to measure true productivity/output.  You can work 10 hours, but in reality you might’ve only focused on high-priority tasks for 2 hours and the other 8 hours was low-priority tasks. Focus your time in the morning on the high-priority tasks ( marketing, sales, client communication ), then spend time on other lower-priority tasks.  "," In the beginning, we relied on cold prospecting, word-of-mouth and content marketing. Once I realized that this wasn’t going to consistently deliver enough sales opportunities for us to grow our revenue - I started running paid advertising on Facebook & Instagram. That’s developed into our largest source of leads & sales. It’s predictable, controllable, and scalable. At the time of this writing ( February 2020 ) - we generate $7 in revenue for every $1 we spend on paid advertising. We go into each quarter knowing that: If we spend around $10,000 in paid advertising dollars...We’re going to end up with roughly 310 or more completed sales/consultation calls... 20% or more of those calls will close for our consulting or training products/services ...We’ll end up with “X"" in gross revenue ( variable depending on the types of clients we brought on that quarter/the services we sold ) We’ve been able to significantly lower our cost per lead & cost per appointment by implementing custom/lookalike audiences within Facebook Ads Manager.  The “cold” interests that are offered to you inside of Ads Manager haven’t been very effective for us in any B2B campaign. Retaining our current clients for the long-term is also a way for us to maximize our marketing ROI, gross revenue and referral generation. ‍"," If you’d like to learn more about our company, visit our main website by clicking here.

58,edlatimore," I’m Ed Latimore and I’m a writer who focuses on overcoming addictions, dealing with trauma, and developing practical applications of stoicism and forgiveness to improve the relationship you have with yourself and others.  My website is edlatimore.com and is broken down into five categories: Mental mastery, physical mastery, emotional mastery, money skills, and addiction & sobriety. To supplement the free information on my site, I have a variety of books and courses to help people develop in these areas as well. ‍",," I’m fortunate in that I’m involved in content creation, so it’s difficult to make mistakes, per se. The one thing I wish I had more of is to promote my products more aggressively.  My email list is probably half the size that it could be today because I did not do the work of heavy promotion early on. I’ve easily left six figures of revenue on the table because I did not promote as heavily.  The big thing I’ve learned is that if you’re in business for yourself, you live and die by promotion and marketing. One of the big changes I’ve made recently is that I promote my content much more heavily now than I ever have before. This has resulted in more sales, signs ups, and visitors. All of those are excellent outcomes for my brand. ‍",," Today things are going very well from the revenue and social media side, but I have hit a small snag in the search engine traffic. However, these things are bound to happen when you rely solely on organic traffic, as Google is always modifying its algorithm. This just means that we have to adapt on our side and create even better content. My goals for the future are to get the site to making $50,000/mo passively, as well as doing 100k visits/mo from organic traffic. I believe the best way to reach these goals is to continue to provide useful content that is both optimized for the search engines and serves my audience. ",," I started like any other would-be blogger or writer. I launched a WordPress-hosted website and began writing. Once I felt like I had a big enough following, I decided to start writing books and producing programs based on the things that I felt met two crucial criteria: I had personal experience with the problem and I could stand by what I taught no matter what phase of my life I was in.  The first thing is what I think should be standard in the content creation industry, but unfortunately, many people are “faking it until they make it”. The second thing forces me to not only make decisions based on what I want my name and brand to be associated with, but also how I will carry myself in the future. For example, I’ve been sober now for almost 8 years. I really enjoy the life that I have as a result of sobriety. I feel like overcoming that problem is something I have a lot of experience with (The first criteria met) and I’ll always want to be a sober guy with discipline over himself (The second criteria met). The second condition also works as a small hedge against any type of relapse. I’d never be taken seriously again if people caught me drinking, for example. I’d lose both from a business and personal standpoint.",," I grew up extremely poor in public housing projects, but I managed to move out when I was 18 and I’ve never been back. I spent most of my 20s doing two things: drinking to excess and boxing. The former almost destroy my potential to go far in the latter, however, I eventually quit for good on December 23rd, 2013. Recovered addicts never forget their sobriety date.  Drinking was my “keystone habit”. Once I knocked that one out, the rest followed. Now I could focus on being an even better fighter, writer, and eventually earn my degree in Physics. During this time, I had been writing about all aspects of my life and journey on my website. I’ve always wanted to have a blog and be a writer, but I had trouble finding my “voice”. As a result, the blogs never quite took off or I lost interest. The thing that made this blog stick is that I found my voice—writing about what I’d learned the hard way with the intention of making sure that other people could learn it the easy way. Because I’d overcome so many challenges (grew up in poverty, struggled and overcame alcoholism, won national titles as an amateur boxer, boxed professionally, and earned a physics degree to name few things), I believed that my perspective was authentic and that I could help many people with it. ‍"," From a content creation side, I’ve learned that if you went through it, someone needs to hear about your experiences. We are not so unique that no one has ever experienced similar problems before. You can help someone by creating something that teaches what you learned.  This means that you should write about it (or shoot a video, podcast, or make a post). Someone is going to get something from your story, even if you don’t think there’s anything particularly useful or remarkable about it.  From a business and operations side, I’ve learned the power of delegation. If you want to be successful at what you do, then you won’t be able to do it alone. It’s important that you select good partners and associates to team up and delegate work to as well as putting great systems in place to help you achieve this.  I’ve gotten better at delegating over the years so that I can focus on the most important part of my brand, which is content creation. I have people who handle my tech and advertising so that I focus on what I’m best at."," I’ve relied on a mixture of strategies to grow my website and brand. First, I’ve embraced social media and I’m extremely active there. This has given me a large audience to share my content and has made it easier for people to discover my content as well.

I am currently working on a product idea called Market Canvas - think ProductHunt for marketing software. A discovery engine that helps marketers find right and latest marketing tools.  "," We spoke to a few interested parties initially and the feedback we received were: - Personalization was not an immediate need as of that day in the app world. We failed to realize how big a problem like that was, and somehow assumed the market would see the value in the product. - We approached the wrong end or segment of the market. A mobile dev house is the last mile for an app that’s being developed, so personalization software sale targeted towards them is not a great idea. - We were yet another software in the already crowded mobile software field. There were no case studies or a quantifiable way to articulate our value proposition except for drawing parallels to the web. This failed to capture the interest of any prospective customers. - We were early to the game of personalization of apps and our marketing strategy and approach was wrong. - Our brand name was a disaster and most of the traffic that we got, for free, was looking for an alternate name called “Eliquis” a drug from Bayer. There was no way we would win the SEO game. We had no SEO strategy or any other ecosystem strategy to piggyback our marketing on. - We were early and spent our energy on different things rather than focusing on building a case for ourselves and personalization needed in apps. We failed to educate the market.  I believe that we’re all inundated with quite a lot of learning/how-to articles than we care to read or manage to read. However, being selective and choosing your learning sources is something that I actively do now. My key goal is to learn from anything I read and listen.

What I saw was that the web evolved from being hello user to “Hello Bob, it’s great to meet you on a wonderful December day” - whereas the mobile app was the same except for the social app e.g. FB, Twitter, 4Square etc. The rest of the apps treated the user very transactionally. We thought a way to remedy that was to offer a personalization platform and humanize the apps.  "," A few things: - We would validate the idea at the conceptual level by creating a few ad campaigns and digital marketing campaigns to gauge user interest and need. We’d interview the target or potential customer segments and try to understand the problem and not assume a need. - I would definitely not put a lot of emphasis on domain name or invest a lot of money without researching the potential of the name. - I would build the product in its entirety as an API, SDK rather than a service and launch it toward the developer network e.g. like Twilio only focused towards personalization. - I would find an ecosystem to market to as it’s hard to acquire customers directly. I would also educate, engage and involve myself in the world that my initial customer segment lives in. - I would create a much better customer acquisition strategy either via personal recruitment or ecosystem mining. I definitely would start with a SEO strategy and not mess up on the brand name as I did before. ‍  I will use some expressions to summarize my learnings Don’t put the cart before the horseDon’t assume a market need, validate it.

60,embarque," I'm currently the founder and CEO of Embarque, a productized agency for premium content that converts, at affordable prices. At the moment, most of our clients hire us to create SEO content, including blog posts and landing pages. We've worked with many hyper-growth startups such as VEED, MentorCruise, and Levels FYI. So far, it's been great. ‍  I've been getting paid for my writing since I was 16 (I'm now 27). I earned a BA in English Literature with Creative Writing on a scholarship from UEA, one of the UK's most competitive universities for the program. Founding a content marketing agency might seem like a natural progression, but I didn't have a desire to grow my own revenue-generating business until I stumbled upon the indie making community in October 2018 when I was in London, UK. In fact, before that, money was an afterthought, and my living conditions were scrappy, to say the least. For instance, throughout my time in London, I slept on friends' couches for a few months, lived in a house under renovation for free in exchange for (very bad) carpentry work, and rented a pantry as a bedroom. During the last one, the house was located on a street in Tottenham that was quarantined twice due to gunshot noises. That said, the room was only £380 with utilities included, so I'd say it was a fair deal for London standards! While being part of the indie making community, it dawned on me how lucrative my skills were in writing and community engagement. I expanded my network in the scene by taking part in fun online blogging initiatives, such as being an editor at Maker Mag and actively engaging in relevant communities. The indie making community has changed my life on a financial level. Three months after being part of it, I was earning 2.5x more than my full-time salary in a French email tech company by working with founders and bootstrappers. It helped me develop a healthier relationship with money, understand the value of my work, and see how launching and growing companies can be darn fun. The community has helped me understand that I can build an ethical business and provide a reasonable stream of income for content writers and other creatives.  So that brings me to Embarque. I owe much of my creative growth to extremely talented — yet overlooked — underground writers, artists, performers, poets, and journalists who are either brown, queer, women or a mixture of these identities. At Embarque, we want to link talented English-speaking content writers to founders and companies that need their services. As a nod to my creative roots, we aim to make our hiring practices as inclusive as possible. As the saying goes, 'talent is everywhere, opportunity is not.' On the client-facing side, we want to help bootstrappers and early-stage startups grow fast through quality content marketing. A year into the business, I’d like to say that the results speak for themselves. ‍",," I’ve made so many mistakes along the way that I’m not super proud of. I'll mention some of the main operational and personal obstacles with building Embarque. I'll start with the operational ones. First off, creating a hiring pipeline for skilled writers, fact-checkers, and editors is really, really hard. If a working relationship does not pan out, then you're back to square one in the hiring process, which can easily last for more time than you want.  I have encountered several issues related to hiring that I had never expected to happen. Here are a few off the top of my head: Writers using plagiarized or spun content. We've caught a writer hired through referral spinning content from various sources, and I was not ready to tackle this issue when it happened. It ruined a relationship with a bootstrapper whose work I greatly admired. Oh, well. Since then, we've doubled down on our fact-checking efforts and implemented a zero-tolerance policy for all types of plagiarism, including duplicate content and content spinning. A candidate submitted a portfolio full of content written by a GPT-3 tool. No joke. This only happened once, but I was shocked by how the person thought they could get away with it. I'm confident that people who can't distinguish good writing from bad would be easily fooled by this.Writers not meeting tight deadlines. An added issue of being a remote-first company is having employees who will ghost you if they don't meet deadlines or expectations.  Hiring can still be a struggle. At Embarque, we have a certain quality that we want to uphold. The content marketing industry is tough. One poorly written article can instantly sour a long-term relationship with a client. We need great writers who can follow guidelines, are proactive, and can think clearly and strategically. These qualities allow us to compete against other agencies that promise similar results at significantly higher price points.  As for my personal obstacles, I decided to pursue a Master's program that I ended up not liking, and it took a lot of time and energy that I could have spent on building Embarque. There were times when I had to decline large orders because I had too much coursework to do.  This will probably sound cliché, but the biggest issue I face is taking care of my mental health. I struggle with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD). I have a history of substance abuse mainly attributed to BPD. That said, these very issues mean that I can be obsessive towards achieving things and can do 15-hour workdays without much of a break. The lockdown has helped me focus on work, but I hope I won't regress once everything opens up again. Finally, being a first-time founder, I can get into my head quite often and find myself procrastinating on things out of fear of not doing them well enough. I've learned some prioritization techniques to ensure that I do the tasks that move the needle forward. ‍",," Some exciting stuff ahead. I’ll be launching a newsletter blog called SEO for Startups, which aims to teach startups how to use SEO to scale their marketing without breaking the bank. In the next few months, I will be focused on growing all aspects of the business, from operations to customer acquisition. I have not been able to work on Embarque as much as I wanted to, so I'm pretty excited about what lies ahead. In particular, I want to: Work on expanding our key offerings, including technical content creation and making our email copywriting services more apparent. For the technical content bit, I'm currently collaborating with very talented indie makers such as Basile Samel to work on expanding our technical content services.Boost our marketing strategy. From SEO to social media, I'm working to make our social media presence more active!Build out our sales and affiliate program. Many people are inquiring about becoming an affiliate for Embarque, and we're already seeing some promising returns after onboarding an affiliate partner. ‍",,,," I'm a first-time founder, and the idea behind Embarque came about in a chat that I had with Dominic Monn in May 2020. As the founder of MentorCruise, Dominic was looking to scale his SEO content production efforts but hated the process of looking for writers. So he pitched the idea of me launching a content writing marketplace.  I found it interesting but quickly realized that it would take a long time to see profitability with that business model. It also still wouldn't eliminate the vetting process completely. Platforms like Fiverr and Upwork can be interesting, but people's skills in writing, editing, and content strategy can vary widely. Content mills tend to produce spun content of subpar quality, underpay their writers and are often involved in shady practices that I don't want to be part of. Eventually, I stumbled upon the productized service business model employed by some of the competitors in the content marketing niche. It was perfect for Embarque. Productizing our content marketing services allows us to show our pricing transparently, focus on being good at selected key offerings, and scale our growth through these services. On the operations side, we can look for and vet talented writers to make sure that our clients get quality content, on time."," I've learned a ton about profiting on scalability. Before Embarque, I had only worked with agencies as a freelancer and had no idea about the business development side of things. I didn't have a sense of people's purchasing habits for high-ticket content marketing services. As I mentioned, I mistakenly thought that my main market would consist of people who would buy single articles or the lower-tier packages. In reality, we mostly have repeat clients who pay for the top packages valued at $1250 or above. B2B clients will pay a lot for vendors who can scale their content production without much hassle. Why? Because scaling production is a process in itself that requires coordinating, vetting, and hiring writers, editors, fact-checkers, and content strategists. If a vendor can relieve them of these tasks, clients will be willing to pay more so that they can focus on other strategic initiatives that will help grow their business. Another important lesson that I've learned is that there is a limit to being scrappy. Scrappy is great when you're in the process of getting your first clients. That said, once you've achieved product-market fit, not having robust processes due to an overreliance on scrappiness and 'quick' fixes can lead to problems later on. I learned this the hard way when I didn't spend enough time hiring new writers and had to turn down a very big potential client. Make sure that you're quick to react to market changes and trends, but not at the cost of building processes and systems that allow your startup to work and grow. Finally, I've known this for quite a long time but somehow forgot along the way: use your connections. I was so busy building my own company and making it seem like I knew what I was doing that I forgot that there are people in my network willing to help me thrive and succeed in growing Embarque. Contact the people you've worked well with in the past. If they are willing to work with you again, this can eliminate a lot of hassle in the hiring process."," Community engagement and word-of-mouth referrals. I have experience in online community building, so I already knew how to interact with groups and the like, but I would be lying if I said that I was disciplined in my efforts. My acquisition efforts have been mostly haphazard at best, but this is something that I do want to change in the future.  However, there were a few specific milestones that have helped us grow our revenue by a large amount. Here are some of them: This became a top milestone for the day on Indie Hackers and was featured in the newsletter. I converted three Steer clients from that feature. Pretty rad.This case study tweet thread converted one Steer client and a couple of lower-tiered ones.  I also got some package clients by being active on Weekend Club, Indie London, ContentUK, Email Geeks, and the Productize Community on Facebook. It's worth having evangelists in relevant communities that will readily talk positively about your services, rather than doing the bragging yourself. Having evangelists brings more credibility to your business. Aside from that, you can always provide value by sharing your progress in a vulnerable, authentic way. Lean into the human side of growing a business and share the unsavory bits. Don't fight the funk.  I got a significant portion of my MRR (around $5,000) through personal referrals. This isn't easily repeatable, but when you've come to a point where you are steadily getting clients, remember to nurture your relationship with every single one. If your services require client-side account management, make sure that you're personable and reachable. If you're a SaaS business, automate meaningful engagement with your customers, such as through email campaigns asking them direct feedback. In the next few months, my focus is on refining and systemizing our growth processes. I'm also in the process of doubling down efforts on certain channels, namely affiliate, sales, and SEO. These will be exciting times for us! ‍"," TwitterSEO for Startups blogEmbarque’s websiteMy personal blog If you're interested in updates on what I'm up to, feel free to follow me on Twitter.

61,emit," Hey, I’m a 23-year-old engineering graduate from Imperial College London and co-founded emit with my friend Thushaan in June 2018. emit is a smartwatch that makes you more conscientious with your use of time by using the psychology of scarcity. emit shows you a countdown of your most important tasks, events and goals - and the name is just time in reverse. I’m CEO of emit and as a new start-up we have to do everything ranging from designing the watch and the manufacturing to building a community of supporters to back us on Kickstarter. ‍",," The challenge in growing emit is being in a place where the minimum order quantity from our manufacturers is 1000 units which is not much for them, but needing to raise around $45k from Kickstarter which is a large amount for a project with very little market spend. We have had to bootstrap a lot of the marketing, outreach to PR and customers, as well as create the creative assets to showcase emit. It's an exhilarating experience as we get to learn incredible amounts every day, and have to learn to be rapid and decisive but also thoughtful with our actions. Being a recently graduated student, there is always the pressure of pursuing a traditional corporate career with big names and high starting salaries. It is initially difficult to express your vision with a business especially when it has not yet started generating revenues. Our hardest challenge so far has been raising funds by exhausting our list of friends and family as our initial group of backers. Apart from being very time intensive as you have to manually reach out to them, it also involves a lot of awkward conversations and unfortunately strained relations too. To the personal relations who do back you, you now have the added pressure of delivering a successful product as it puts your trustworthiness at stake. On the other hand, it also drives us to work even harder to make a success out of emit. ‍  In terms of mistakes, we started by asking what now looks like really basic questions about manufacturing to our manufacturers. We have had a very steep learning curve about the process so far. We also realized that spending money on Facebook ads ought to be done with much more tight goals (metrics) as otherwise, you can be fiscally very irresponsible in the chase of acquiring customers. We have learned to set a fixed customer acquisition cost and divvy up the different strategies that we will spend on to trying to acquire a customer. We are also improving our outreach and media assets in quality with every piece of content we release. We have become clearer on wanting to only produce content that is valuable to our community instead of pure ads as it builds a stronger sense of service for us. We have also become more disciplined in prioritizing goals and milestones instead of trying to do a bunch of different things at once with diluted effort. We started off by wanting to only show countdowns on the watch, but user feedback led us to quickly incorporate normal time, heart rate monitoring and footsteps as well. We did this to balance being a purely time keeping device with the minimal functions needed to convince a user to have an emit on their wrist. This was probably our biggest pivot - but we stay true to our core of wanting to change a user’s behavior with time by always showing them some form of time. ‍",,," The greatest disadvantage we have is being a start-up doing hardware. The saying “hardware is hard” is true. Not having the scale of a large manufacturing facility and being based in the UK, whilst working with Chinese and American partners can be challenging but part of the excitement too. We are competing against both traditional watches, and smartwatches. Whilst we don’t provide the social media and music functions of smartwatches as we want to keep it purely timekeeping focuses - we also have to convince people that their wrist space can be used to project a part of their personality that is pioneering and forward thinking with emit. The first pushback we get from people is why not make this an app on the phone or on a smartwatch - which is clear to us won’t work. The mission of emit is to be a physical reminder of the importance of your time and goals - like a wedding ring does to you when you’re married. An app wouldn’t work because it would be lost amidst the clutter of all the other distractions like social media and messaging which would be counterproductive to you. The other common reticence about emit is the fact that it might be stress-inducing which we have countered by limiting the countdowns to 10 events and goals - to ensure that you’re not using it like a minute by minute planner but more like an overall guide of timelines to the most important things to your life."," We started working on emit in Jan 2018 by making a storyboard of the watch user interface and decided on all the important features for a smartwatch that would enable users to improve their time management and productivity. We wanted to keep it minimal in design so went with a black and white color scheme. We then coded an Android app that mimicked the required features and uploaded it onto a Motorola smartwatch - this was our first prototype. It was an MVP that allowed us to get a feel for the usefulness of the watch and show it to other users. Being Engineering students, we approached the design from a very utilitarian perspective, with the objective of keeping emit as simple and declutter as possible. Our goal is to use technology to change your mindset and behavior versus just adding more functionality. Using Computer-aided Design at our university (Imperial College) we then made a 3D model of our casing, strap, screen and internal components - which we sent to different manufacturers in China. After figuring out which manufacturer was best in terms of manufacturing requirements, shipping and pricing, we asked for sample prototypes to be sent. We then also developed a phone which will be used for inputting all the user’s countdowns through calendar syncing into the watch. We had to overcome the challenges of convincing people to first look at time in a completely different way (in reverse) than has been done for centuries. It also became clear that we are trying to appeal to users who no longer use watches because they can see normal time on their phones, and don’t see the point of wearing a device that only does that. We wanted to contextualize time to each person - and our challenge was to find the niche group of people who were specifically looking for a similar solution. We decided to launch on Kickstarter because it was the perfect ground of marrying investors with customers -  a place where we could raise funds and gauge market interest. We wanted to price as aggressively as possible, and are happy that we’ve managed to have Kickstarter tiers at $99, $119 and $139 depending on how early in the campaign you buy them. This is still less than half of what smartwatches retail for, and it ensures that we can compete with both - smartwatches and traditional watches.",," My co-founder, Thushaan, and I would often walk back home from university together and talk about how we never have enough time to do all the things we want. As engineers, we wanted to solve this and realized that traditional watches don’t show you how to best use your time. We set out to design a simple and effective tool to change our mindset in regards to productivity and time. As students, procrastination often plagued our days and was the cause of unachieved goals. We wanted something that constantly reminded us of our priorities and what we should be doing with our time. The idea was born out of a joke of thinking of making a deathwatch, one that would count down to your death. But we then realized that it would be really interesting to play on the psychology of scarcity to make our minds realize how valuable and irreversible time is. We decided to make use of technology to help change behavior. Keeping it as simple an idea as possible we wanted to bring something fresh to the watch industry which is either saturated with smartwatches that all do the same thing or traditional watches which show you nothing but present time. We’re charged to change people’s attitude towards time and convince them that there is an even better way of looking at it. ‍"," Hindsight really is 20-20. We would do a lot of things differently - be more decisive, act faster, do fewer things that weren’t a key to the existence and immediate success to emit but I guess we can only know what they were in hindsight. It would have been hugely beneficial to have read up on the manufacturing process of watches and crowdfunding specific marketing prior to starting work on emit. We should have spent more time building a community for backing emit instead of purely focusing on the product and then spreading the word. We were initially worried about having our idea copied, and very quickly have come to realize that execution is by far more important than just an idea. We’re no longer afraid of competition as it’s a longer-term challenge, and we believe we’ve already got a head start in terms of community building. ‍"," In terms of marketing, we’ve built a social media following on Facebook and Instagram. We’ve released campaign videos explaining the ethos of emit and our vision with starting a revolution on time. We have built a community of people who are focused on improving themselves and their lives by controlling time instead of accepting defeat to its inevitable nature. We began by building an email list of backers who were interested in emit and wanted to keep up to date with our progress and know when we launch on Kickstarter. We also used targeted ads on Facebook which we realized requires a larger budget for optimizing metrics and decided it was too expensive for us to run on a tight budget. We then started using Reddit to gain some traction from sub-Reddit on discipline, productivity and motivation. We’ve realized that getting the video out there to the right audience is the hardest bit as once we do show the concept, people are often interested at least. It feels great when people proactively reach out to us asking about emit, and when they can grab one as it makes us feel like we’ve made something that’s valuable. For Kickstarter projects, we have found that Instagram is perhaps not yet the best platform to find backers as much as it can be a great source of telling your brand story. Our university has been great in spreading the word to the wider student community and getting us in touch with other Kickstarter projects too. ‍"," The best place to find out more is on our website. You can keep up-to-date with our Kickstarter campaign on. Feel free to reach out to us on team@ownemit.com - we’re super happy to answer any questions or just have a chat! UPDATE: We successfully raised over 330% of our goal on Kickstarter, and with 180 backers pre-ordering and supporting our project - it’s been a great early validation to us that there is a strong interest for a smartwatch that helps people see time in a different way. We are now in the process of manufacturing the watches and raising our seed-round. We are very excited to build the next version of emit with time management analytics and an AI assistant that enables smart scheduling. Thanks!"," There are loads of immensely instrumental books on entrepreneurship, but just a few of the ones we’ve found helpful are: The Hard Thing about Hard Things, Lean Startup, Zero to One and Creativity Inc. It’s much more important, I think, to know what specifically you are looking to learn, than just reading books that are considered generally good. Paul Graham’s essays and all of YCombinator’s Start-up School content on Youtube is also very helpful in shedding light on common challenges faced by startups and what a good framework to solve those are. Medium is also a great place to find other Kickstarter projects who have laid out pretty much step by step processes on all the strategies they employed to get funded. Having done as much research as we can on other startups, founders, projects - and continuing to learn as much as we can from others’ experience - we have found that trying things on your own is still the best teacher. ‍",,e-Commerce,,United Kingdom,"April 10, 2019",Stephen Titus,https://www.failory.com/interview/emit,"['http://www.ownemit.com', 'https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thush/emit-smartwatch-change-your-perspective-on-time', 'mailto:team@ownemit.com']",success,1,$0-$10k/mo,"Inspired by their lack of time and problem with procrastination, Thushaan and Stephen co-founded emit, a smartwatch that aims to boost productivity by showing you countdowns.

62,encharge," Aloha, Failory! I’m Kalo, one of the founders of Encharge – a marketing automation tool that aims to connect all your marketing apps. My background is in interaction design. I built my first website when I was 11. It was a website for the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons. Yes, I’m that kind of a geek. I graduated in the UK with Graphic and Digital design.  Then I started working in one of the top digital marketing agencies in London with the bold name Elvis. I’ve done works for big boys like Magners, Virgin, Sky, NBA, Microsoft, UK Gov, and the list goes on. It was always a dream of mine to work in a cool, big digital agency, but I soon found out client work is not my cup of tea.  In 2013 I started my entrepreneurial journey – since then I’ve started at least 7 different startups – most of them failed miserably. I’m currently 27 and residing in sunny Sofia, Bulgaria where we build our latest startup Encharge with my co-founder Slav. ",," As an early stage startup, the obvious challenge is validating that people actually want to use your product.  As a pre-launch tool, we are still not 100% confident that the feature set we have on our roadmap is the right one, but we do our best to minimize the risks. In a more personal aspect, I’d say the biggest obstacle for me is balancing my client consulting work with the startup.  As a bootstrapped pre-launch company, I still don’t have the luxury to work full-time on Encharge. Right now, I’m consulting 2 days a week while spending the rest on Encharge. It’s challenging to juggle between projects, but I do my best to tackle it by having a very organized schedule and a daily to-do list. ‍  One of our advantages is also one of our biggest disadvantages – the marketing automation market is extremely saturated. There are dozens if not hundreds of decade-old gorillas like ActiveCampaign and Mailchimp. It’s scary because these guys have built a huge barrier to entry and compete on relatively low price points. We still believe that no one is solving the marketing connectivity problem good enough, so there is room for tiny players like us with a unique positioning angle.  Before starting with Encharge, we made the mistake of not sticking with a single product for long enough. We were jumping from project to project and not giving them enough of a chance, discarding any ideas that don’t receive positive feedback within 10 customer development interviews or less. Another mistake we made was not relying on our strengths and interests enough. We tried to validate ideas in markets that we weren’t very interested enough or require skills beyond our core skill set. Before moving forward with Encharge, we jotted down specific criteria for the type of startup we want to work on: Big, horizontal categoryA lot of existing competitors (saturated market)Something that excites both of usSomething that we have experience withB2BSelf-serve mode – Something that we can sell from a website ‍",," Our goal is to generate at least $3,000 in MRR by the end of the year.  As a pre-launch/pre-revenue startup, this goal is motivating but also challenging.  We’re going to face challenges with finding (some) product market fit in the first few months. As people say – the first 10 customers are the hardest. For the moment we aim to stay small and lean. We’re currently using people off UpWork for smaller tasks but don’t see expanding with full-time hires before start generating revenue. I’m very excited about a couple of side marketing projects that we have in the makings – for example, this directory of free tools that we aim to launch on Product Hunt soon. ",," We’re still pre-launch but before we started building Encharge we actually validated the idea and made $4,000 in pre-orders. Since cold emails didn’t prove to be very effective for customer development, we decided to switch the script and do some inbound marketing.  It all started with the article in which I shared my previous experience with HeadReach. That article generated almost 3,000 page views and 500-600 email leads. We later validated the idea for Encharge with that audience by creating a mock prototype and a landing page with the opportunity to pre-order a lifetime access to the tool for $89.  In 2 weeks we got 50 pre-orders. We haven’t done a lot of marketing for the pre-order deal apart from sending to that list of 500 people. Because we’re scratching our own itch and we had conversations with potential leads, we knew we were targeting a real pain – the message was clear, and people didn’t need a lot of convincing to understand the solution.‍ Note: currently the landing page shows an email opt-in.  With the pre-order revenue, we had some confidence to start building the product. My technical co-founder is building the product in React. We also rely on out of the box services like JointJs (for our flow builder) to get fast to market with smaller development times.  We’re currently in Closed Beta. It took us 6 months to build a product with the most vital features. Being in a very competitive, red-ocean market the challenge is to build a robust feature-set while scoping it down as much as possible only to the most valuable features. ‍",," Before I started Encharge, I was working on another SaaS tool – HeadReach, a lead generation tool.  HeadReach was generating $2,000 in MRR, and we had a few thousand users. Just as we started growing HeadReach, Google emailed us that they’re closing the Site Search API – the primary “technology” we use to find leads. Long story short, we sold HeadReach to one of our competitors for a small fee. After HeadReach I felt miserable for a year. I was bouncing from project to project without any traction. That feeling when you don’t have a clue what product to start building. It very much resembles a sickness. Then we decided we’re going to validate new ideas with Slav. It took us at least 5 or 6 startups until we stopped on Encharge. We started building Encharge in October last year, and we just launched our closed Beta. Launching the Open Beta in a few weeks. The idea for Encharge came from my pains as a marketer at startup companies.  Integrating the whole marketing stack is hard.  In every startup that I worked at it took at least 2 developers and a few weeks until we had the right setup to execute powerful lifecycle marketing campaigns. Every time I tried to make the CRM, emails, in-app events, landing pages, and other tools work together, I failed. I had to resort to ugly hacks, and eventually involve a dev team.  That’s why most early-stage startups and even mature SaaS companies default to sending one-off email blasts and don’t do anything beyond that.  They simply don’t have the right data and set up to do something more holistic. We thought we could change that with Encharge by building a simple to use tool that connects with you marketing apps and allows you to create powerful marketing workflows.", Do things that you like Experiment fast Persist more. Don’t put out fires that haven’t started burning. Keep a daily to-do list. Don’t multitask. Keep a regular sleeping schedule. ‍," Since the validation stage, we’ve been aggressively focused on pre-launch marketing.  We have 2 goals for the pre-launch: Grow our organic/sustainable website traffic to 150 unique visits per day.Grow our email list to 3,000 subscribers before June We’re slightly behind schedule but growing steadily with both metrics. Our current list growth below. And of course, we use Encharge as our marketing automation and email sending tool :) Since we’re a bootstrapped startup, we don’t spend anything on paid acquisition. All of our traffic and leads are coming from content and resources that I create and distribute using free channels.  The marketing tactics that have worked so far are: Creating long-form posts like this one and this one and promoting them.Creating free marketing resources.Posting engagement posts on LinkedIn And growing our private Facebook group.

63,endeavorun," Hey, I’m Jake! I’m 33, live in Arlington, Virginia, and I’m the creator of Endeavorun, a running company that hosts retreats for recreational adult runners. Our retreats are a hybrid vacation & workshop where runners of all levels join a handful of professional athletes, coaches, and experts (sports dietitians, strength coaches, etc.) for a pro-style training camp. I launched Endeavorun back in 2019 and our first attempt at an in-person retreat was delayed due to Covid. We pivoted to creating a virtual community during the pandemic that was a huge success and we (finally!) have our first in-person retreat this August in Boulder, CO. Today, I’m focused on all aspects of the business from marketing to product design and customer service, but my main focus is planning our upcoming retreat and thinking strategically about what might come next. ‍",," My bandwidth has been our biggest obstacle to growth. In addition to my full-time job running my consulting practice, I am also a doctoral candidate completing my dissertation, have a toddler at home, and have been recovering from surgery. So I can't always dedicate the focus I'd like, which is part of why I need to be strategic about what's needed if we are to attempt to grow this fall.  Beyond that, I’ve made a few tangible mistakes along the way. I’ve spent the money I allocated to marketing inefficiently I tried a few different approaches just to see what would stick and many of them didn’t. We tried a tiered pricing strategy, created some less-than-perfect-looking online ads, and we hired a marketing consultant to put together a plan that wasn’t any good.  ‍",,"  We’re up and running (pun intended, again)! That’s all I could ask for given how bad 2020 was for launching an in-person event business. Revenue is low as we’re just getting started but we are already profitable. We’ve got a few dozen participants signed up for our first retreat and a handful of brands partnering to provide everything from products, services, and even sponsorship fees.   After our first event this August I’ll have to decide what’s next. We’ve been approached by one or two investors so far and there’s the potential to expand the business significantly. We could not only replicate this event, but we have some ideas in the works to expand similar offerings, branch out into new sports, and add a few more scalable revenue streams that nicely fit alongside our in-person events business. One of the great things is that we need such little capital to operate the business that we could expand organically if we want to without raising any money or taking on much if any, debt. But I have a feeling that if we decide to grow we should go big or go home, in which case we’d probably want to raise money this fall and hire at least one other full-time person to help things expand. ",," I first ran the idea (pun intended) by a few friends who are big in the running industry. Professional runners, professional coaches, fitness writers, running store owners, and entrepreneurs. My explicit goal was to gather feedback and see what obstacles might arise… but I was also really looking for moral support. Did they think I could do this? Did they think anyone could do this? From there, I just went for it! One of the most appealing elements of the business was the ease of launch. Because we don't make a physical product, don't currently employ anyone full-time, don't need an office, and don’t have to physically transact anything, all we needed was a website and commitments from some key industry leaders to be a part of a future event.  For a self-funded launch, I think it went fairly well. By no means did we become the household name we’d like to be one day, but we popped up on enough radars that customers were excited to sign up based on the promise of our retreat alone.  We opted to price our retreats to reward those who signed up earlier. While our service isn’t scalable like a digital product or service, we can create a model whereby there’s a revenue threshold to cover costs and anything beyond that is potential profit.",," Endeavorun is oddly a perfect blend of my own background. I’m a serious runner, an industrial-organizational psychologist and executive coach, and even spent many of my younger years working at summer camps.  The idea came much more organically, however, than simply trying to amalgamate my various interests. The inspiration came from a friend, well-known fitness author Matt Fitzgerald, who had spent a summer living with a professional running team based in Arizona. Matt was already a sport guru but was amazed by how much he learned simply by being immersed with pro athletes. We talked about how much average adults could benefit from an experience like that and tried to distill it into something far more accessible.  Originally, we wanted to create a longer-term running program that was much more comprehensive than a running retreat. But when Covid derailed our original plans, it also allowed us to revisit what the market was clamoring for, and that’s how we arrived at our current vision.  While I do run my consulting firm, I can’t say that I leveraged any specific hard skills from that experience into the creation of Endeavorun. However, there’s no doubt that my background has heavily influenced everything from our external branding to our programmatic design. In particular, my graduate training in adult learning has prepared me to design the retreats with real intent. It enables me to create the workshop elements of our retreat in keeping with the highest standards of professional learning and development programs, rather than simply throwing together a schedule based on convenience and hoping activities are “fun”. That part of my academic background hopefully gives our retreats a unique flavor. "," Don’t launch an in-person events business just as a global pandemic is starting. I don't advise that..... More seriously, I am constantly learning how much to try and shape vs. respond to the market. Our willingness to pivot without compromising our core mission and vision has kept us afloat and I don't want to lose sight of that balance.  ","  We relied heavily on our featured experts and professionals for marketing and created an affiliate-type (though more involved) relationship wherein everyone benefits when the retreat does well.   That helped, but I also made some mistakes. Our first attempt was to offer significant discounts off our starting price through multiple channels, which didn't work as well as I hoped. I think that strategy probably diluted the value of our product, which relative to competitors, is a premium offering.   Lately, we've focused much more on partnering with local stores and groups around the country to create mutual benefit. These groups have sincere local followings in our target demographic, so we've set up opportunities for them to financially benefit by cross-promoting our retreat. For example, we have a handful of great local running specialty stores around the country that can offer their local clients a $100 gift card on us if they sign up for the retreat. It's been a win-win.  We also have a secondary revenue stream that comes from sponsors and partners. There are some impressive companies out there looking to market toward our demographic, so we’ve created partnerships with them wherein they get to take part in our event for a sponsorship fee. At its core, Endeavorun is currently set up like a professional conference business: we bring people together around a topic (running) as well as brands that are trying to access that demographic, so we can bring in revenue on both ends.   ‍", I’d love for you to check us out at www.endeavorun.com and search for Endeavorun on your favorite social channels. We have a lot of work to do and are excited to do it!," I wish I had tools to share… the nature of our business is that we’re very low tech (thanks, Squarespace!) and our secret sauce is in the people and programs we put together! Most of the business inspiration I have comes from academia.

64,eola," Hey! I’m Dan, 25, cofounder and CTO at eola, the complete management platform for activity centres.  Managing a business providing activities and experiences is difficult. There are many tasks to complete, and administrative work that needs to be done every day, including everything from dealing with customers, to managing instructors’ timetables, and staying on top of resource availability. We enable these businesses to automate their processes, massively reducing their daily workload, while significantly increasing their revenue. We make money when our outlets make money. We charge a flat 4% fee (including payment processing) on any transaction that happens via us. We provide our centres with a widget they can put on their site, allowing them to manage and receive bookings in real time. ‍",," At the beginning of this year, we were in the process of closing our largest funding round. Things were looking good for the Summer. Then, lockdown was announced. Though the round was approaching completion, it hadn’t finalised. That’s when disaster struck. We received an email from our lead investor saying that they were out. We called an emergency board meeting at 11:30pm on a Thursday night, trying to work out what the hell we were going to do.  We only had 2 weeks of runway left, and we had to somehow turn that into a year. One of our investors suggested that we choose 1 of our 9 employees to keep. That was a hard thing to hear. We came up with a few options to pursue, but we didn’t have much time. It was with a heavy-heart we called the team meeting that day to announce the current situation. The initial response from the team was phenomenal, something neither me or my co-founder, Callum, could have possibly predicted or asked for. Everyone rallied. People offered to take pay cuts or no pay. We didn’t ask them to do that. Thanks to an incredibly solid effort from Callum and overwhelming support from the team, we managed to navigate through 2020. Somehow, though, we didn’t just “hang on” as a business, we grew. Quite substantially, actually. This is one of the biggest obstacles we've overcome as a business. As a startup we will encounter countless more, and if this taught me something, it is to treasure the team and the support we give each other through the good times and the bad. ‍",," Despite ostensibly being in the travel industry, business is booming during lockdown. Experience providers around the world have found themselves in a unique and challenging place during the COVID outbreak, following restrictions and lockdowns. To operate safely, they need to ditch the paper diaries, disclaimers and receipts now more than ever. They need to be fluid and flexible, with access to easy mass-communication and refunds. As a result, there has been a massive acceleration in the number of businesses looking for software that allows these things, while also not costing them money when they don’t take any bookings. Our growth during COVID has exploded. We've seen a huge increase in inbound leads. Our platform is highly customisable, and only costs money when businesses make it. This makes us the ideal solution to their needs, regardless of whether they're a solo operator, or an enterprise business. We’re currently at nearly 5x revenue from last year, and that number is rapidly growing. As we grow, our margin grows too. We’re currently seeking investment that will help us reach £1bn through the platform by 2025. We’re also expanding our functionality to go far beyond the industry standard, which is massively solidifying our position. ‍",," Neither of us had run an activity centre before. However, something that we both believe in passionately is talking to the customer. To this day, we make it a priority to encourage everyone in the team to join activity trips to get to know our partners and hear direct feedback from our users. From day one we were visiting, calling, and emailing centres, trying to understand where their pain points were, and what we could do to address them. We were initially worried that everyone would have a different set of requirements, but it became pretty clear that almost everyone in this space has a very similar set of issues. We knew it was a big undertaking. Every startup has to make a judgement call on how much time to spend on building an MVP and getting initial systems in place. When we launched our Beta in 2018 with just 5 customers, payouts were being handled by Callum meticulously going through payment spreadsheets and paying out directly from our bank account. That wasn’t scalable, but our other systems were becoming increasingly sophisticated. In order to validate the idea before we’d built a functioning product, we created a “pioneer program”, where businesses could pay £100 to show they were interested in the idea. They got essentially nothing in return, but their money proved to us that there really was a need.",," My co-founder, Callum, originally came up with the idea of making adventure activities more accessible. After going surfing in Scarborough in Winter (I know, right?), he was surprised to see how difficult it was to find more adventures to go on. At the time, I wasn’t looking for a new position, having recently closed down my web development agency. I was tired of the over-hype that came with starting a startup. But when I saw Callum’s job ad, it was quite different. It was realistic and down to earth. Callum had an idea which he thought could work, and he wanted a partner to help build it. From the outset, we had the mindset that we’re almost certainly going to fail, but every day we’re going to try our damned hardest to make sure that’s not the case. We realised pretty rapidly that the main reason that the huge, multi-hundred billion dollar activities industry is primarily offline is due to lack of decent tools and automation. We were going to change that. ‍"," Before starting a business with someone, spend at least a weekend away with them. Get to know them on a personal level, don’t just interview them. I got lucky with Callum, but given the stresses of making a million important decisions per month, I can easily see where less compatible founders could struggle. Fundraising takes longer than you expect, even if there’s a lot of interest. Everyone says it will take longer than you expect, so you increase how long you think it’ll take. You’re still wrong, it’ll take longer. Transparency is the best thing. Between founders, employees and investors, share your best and share your worst. It’s easy to share the good things, but make a habit of sharing the bad. It’ll result in you being trusted, which is vitally important."," During the first years we focused on getting to know our target market, solidifying our business strategy and doing manual reach-outs to new potential partners to test the waters. After the initial period of understanding the market and our customers properly, we hired a head of marketing to start building a more active marketing strategy. We were (and still are) in a pretty classic startup position, where we would love to do big, splashy marketing campaigns on a shoestring budget. Luckily, there’s a lot of things we could do on minimal marketing expense.  We started by building and procuring contact lists of highly relevant experience providers, so we could focus on a personal sales approach. To raise awareness, add value and increase bookings for our partners, we’ve focused heavily on producing high quality B2C content across our blog and social media channels. We promote our partners and their activities in many ways, from exclusive interview features, activity inspiration posts to direct Book Now ads. Additionally, we create content for our partners, including tips and tricks on how to increase bookings, optimise your website and reach new markets. This focus on putting our customers at the centre of our business leads to referrals and great word-of-mouth effects. Combined with low-cost digital B2B campaigns and a strong focus on SEO, this strategy has created a steady stream of inbound lead generation. This has all worked wonders on a modest budget. Though we’re looking forward to being able to do more with greater resources, we believe that the real value will always come from keeping our customers at the centre of our business and us growing together. ‍"," You can learn more about eola in our About Us page or blog. If you run an activity centre, you should consider joining us )"," Other than what’s in our technical stack, there’s very little extra tooling we use.  However, one thing that I definitely can suggest is using Notion to create a data room for investors.

65,eventloot," My name is Justin Anyanwu, I am 34 years old. I am based in Raleigh North Carolina. My background is a bit of a mix. I got my masters in Computer Architecture and my bachelors in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering. I did a bit of coding in college, but I didn’t pick up coding until I started working on personal projects. A few years ago, I built Eventloot, a SaaS platform for wedding planning professionals. It was inspired by the idea that most wedding planners at the time were using Google Docs and Google Spreadsheets to manage weddings for their clients. So, my partner and I decided that we could offer planners a solution that reflected the convenience of cloud-based SaaS products. ‍ What were your job duties at Eventloot? I was the co-founder and CEO of Eventloot. As a developer, I helped my partner who was the architect with development. But my other role involved customer acquisition, marketing and business development. ‍ What was your business model? It was simple. A monthly fee to use Eventloot. Wedding planners will pay a monthly fee to use Eventloot to manage weddings for their clients. ‍"," Poor planning. We didn’t talk about our customers about what they wanted. We made assumptions about what they needed. For instance, we assumed that all they needed was a platform that tracked their events on a calendar and stored contact information and may be sent emails on their behalf. We didn’t plan for onboarding either. Most of our users were coming in with a massive collection of contact info and data. We didn’t plan for how they could import this information. ‍ How did you find your business problems? Problems started occurring the moment we went live and users would sign up and never come back. ‍ How did you realize you were going to fail? After 3 years of working on the platform and we started getting feedback from users that showed that we hadn’t built the core functionalities they needed. For instance, the average wedding planner has helpers/employees. They mostly wanted to be able to create separate accounts for each helper and give them the ability to collaborate on the platform. ‍ What did finally provoke the shutdown of Eventloot? When one of our legacy competitors quickly updated their platform with contemporary design patterns and technology stack. At which point we lost what little leverage we had. That combined with the fact that we’ve been coding for 3 years with nothing to show, we were quickly demoralized. ‍ How did you shut it down? We sent an email to all our users and shut down our azure hosting. It was quite uneventful. Only 2 of users cared. ‍ How did you feel when you close your doors? Relieved. For a while, we knew it was over. And it was no longer fun to work on it. So, closing the doors was just finalizing something we already felt. ‍"," Building the platform quickly and cheaply. Using the .NET stack, I found was too clumsy a way to build the platform. At least I found that was too inefficient. Maybe because of the complexity of learning each component in the stack. My current project is using MeteorJS and MongoDB. Took me less than a month to learn. ‍ What obstacles did you have? Convincing prospects to sign up. Keeping my partner’s spirits high.Your personal and your team disadvantages. ‍ Were there any disadvantages in the market of Eventloot? Event planners are very busy. Wedding seasons make them virtually unreachable. The profession is not exactly established. There’s a range of commitment in that community. Some planners do it for fun others will quit in a couple years and then there are those that have an army of planners working for them. ‍ Did you have any disadvantages in comparison with your competitors? Our competitors were either very established or well-funded. ‍ Did you commit any mistakes? Building Eventloot without consulting with a customer. Initially building without designing the platform on paper. ‍ Did you make any mistakes that cost you time and/or money? We didn’t talk to the people we were building Eventloot for. As a result, we spent a lot of time building either the wrong thing or something they didn’t need. Hiring subpar freelancers initially and then having to find a replacement to redo their work. ‍ Were there any things that could have been made in a better way? Build Eventloot with MeteorJS and MongoDB. Roll out with an MVP that had core functionality that was absolutely useful to a planner. Consult with an established wedding planner at each stage of developing the app. ‍ Any missed opportunities? Working with wedding planners early on.",,,," This was our very first foray into creating software as a service. In the beginning, we tried to do everything ourselves. 1) We tried to rig together a UI, which was basically stitched together from various CSS designs on other sites. I highly recommend that no one should ever do that. It is the least useful thing you can do. 2) After our very first disastrous version, we realized that we needed to hire experts for certain parts of the project. For example, we outsourced the UI design to a freelancer we found on Fiverr. We hired a number of AngularJS freelancers to handle the frontend for us. 3) We met at Starbucks to code whatever feature we had agreed that the platform needed. ‍ How long did the process take? Quite a lot - 3 years. ‍ Who was involved? My partner and me. And 2 freelancers we hired. ‍ What resources/tools did you use? Bizspark credit from Microsoft. This allowed us to use Visual Studios Enterprise. Free Azure hosting for the platform. Starbucks as our office. ‍ How did the initial product look? The one thing that we did right was the design. A lot of our prospects commented on the design. Some wished it had a more feminine look. But most people felt it was much more contemporary than our competitors. ‍ Did you run into any obstacles in this process? A lot of the obstacles were more mental. The feeling that we might be making a big mistake with how we’ve tackled the project. The feeling that we might be in a crowded market or that our customers might be too difficult to sell to. We simply pushed forward. ‍ Did you enjoy the process of building it? Actually yes. A significant chunk of the journey was a lot of fun. The sense of purpose and ambition. Waking up every day knowing that you had something interesting to work on. That was a lot of fun. Also, the comradery that I built with my partner. ‍ How did you approach pricing your product? We bounced between charging based on the amount of effort we put in which would have put us at $30/month. And pricing it strategically to undercut the competition at roughly ($9-$10)/month. We settled on $20/month. ‍ Did you launch/publicize your product in any way? That too was a first for us. We spent roughly $600 on Facebook ads. That got us nowhere. It was very difficult to properly target for event planners or wedding planners. At least we knew our conversion rate was awful. So, I spent more time sending out emails to planners on WeddingWire. That was a lot more rewarding. If nothing else we learned why prospects wouldn’t join or what it would have taken for them to join.",," I’ve always wanted to start my own business. At the time, I was already running an Anime lifestyle brand. We sold graphic tees and posters. But I quickly realized that it wasn’t scalable. The profit margins were not enjoyable and the need for inventory made it hard to consistently realize a certain level of profit. I started gravitating towards software after I met people who were making a livable wage off their software assets. And considering that their profit margins were much higher and also the fact that their expenses were a little more manageable, it was too tempting to resist not considering. Another thing I loved about the idea of Eventloot is the fact, that if we got it running properly we’d basically have a system for recurring income that didn’t require us to trade our time for money. Eventloot just happened to be an idea I came up with after I ran into an event planner who told me she still used spreadsheets and email to manage her events. It could have been anything depending on the type of person I ran into that day. ‍ What part of your background defines you, and possibly led to starting Eventloot? I am a software engineer by trade. I don’t consider myself to be a great software engineer. But the one thing I can say about myself is that I have become fairly resourceful due to my experience with starting entrepreneurial ventures. I know where to find the right freelancers to help us achieve a goal. ‍ Before Eventloot, what were you doing? Before Eventloot, I was running an anime lifestyle brand (I still am) and I had a day job (I still do). My day job involved writing software that ran on Point of Sale systems. ‍ Did you have any failed or previous businesses? Before Eventloot, I built a trading platform for college students while still in college. It was a massive failure mainly because we didn’t code it in a scalable way. It was written in PHP and HTML with an SQL DB. That’s not the problem, the problem was that we wrote almost everything in two-three files and we wrote all our queries by hand. It was awful whenever we found a bug that needed fixing. ‍ Did any big life events lead to starting Eventloot? Not really, Eventloot is just a product of my desire to be my own boss. And that desire started after I sat in on a group of NCstate alumni talking about how they started their own company. ‍ How did the idea come to you? Eventloot came to me after talking to an event planner who was trying to invite me to a valentine’s event she was organizing. It was after asking her how she managed her business that I realize that there might be an opportunity there. ‍"," If you could talk to your former self before Eventloot, what would you tell him? Know who you’re building your product for. Understand what they really want. Plan before you write even a single line of code. ‍ What do you wish you spent more time on? Talking to customers. ‍ What do you wish you spent less time on? Marketing. We weren’t ready to start marketing. We should have taken an incremental approach where we could at least satisfy a small number of users and a gradual scale from there. Marketing a failed product was a waste of time and money. ‍ Were you worried about anything when starting that at the end you realize doesn't matter? Yes, Trademark and incorporation. None of that matters until you have a clear path to profitability. ‍"," We spent a lot of time scanning WeddingWire and theKnot. We’d harvest emails of planners from those sites and send out personalized emails to each one. That was a lot of work. ‍ What tactics worked? Emailing planners, we found on the sites I mentioned. ‍ How did you approach these tactics? We had to script a scraper to obtain the emails from the sites. ‍ What didn't work? Facebook Ads. Awful ROI. Oh yea, 1 on 1 meetings with prospects was just as bad. A 1-hour meeting with a planner just to get $20/month? Will never do that again. ‍ Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous? Sometimes a mix of sweat equity and ingenuity goes a long way. So rather than just running ads or having 1 on 1 with planners, I found a middle ground. I obtained a ton of emails and I took the time to create a customizable email based on the recipient. ‍"," You can follow me on Twitter or on the Indie Hackers community.

66,explorevr," Hey Failory! Thanks for sitting down with me to do this interview. It’s great to have an opportunity to do a post-mortem on a failed business attempt and to share my experiences with other entrepreneurs. You are doing a great service to the startup community because it seems that talking about this subject in business is largely taboo. It seems like there’s a lot of lip service being paid to accepting failure, but in reality, we only tend to tolerate it from people who have already become successful at what they do, and now tell us their war stories. Where does that leave the rest of us who are still trying to find traction? There’s a martial arts maxim that goes “we either win, or we learn”. I feel that the business world could greatly benefit from adopting that some of that mindset. A few words about me: My name is Andrey Norin, I am a 35-year-old technologist and budding entrepreneur living in Queens, NY. I work as a senior enterprise technology consultant primarily in the financial services space. Currently, I am regrouping and getting ready to jump into another venture. About a year ago, I felt the urge to start working on creating my first legit startup. I have read somewhere that it takes an average of 6 business attempts or pivots to hit pay dirt, so I felt like it was my time to get in the game and start paying my dues. This is where ExploreVR.net comes into the picture. Last summer, I became quite interested in emerging technologies. At the time it seemed like Virtual Reality (VR) was finally getting ready for primetime. That made me want to explore various low-cost business models that I could potentially get into. Initially, I thought about starting a VR equipment rentals business. VR hardware is prohibitively expensive for the casual user (between $1,500 and $2,000), so I thought about purchasing some headsets and accessories that I could lease out in the short term. However, after having done the math, I realized that the business model I initially chose was very unattractive. Research showed that margins would be low, the risk of losing the initial investment was high, and the amount of manual labor around inventory management and customer service was unacceptable to me. So that led me to (what I thought was) a “genius idea”. I understood that not everyone would be as diligent as me in terms of doing the hard numbers in advance and appreciating the risks involved. There would be an emerging ecosystem of small Virtual Reality based businesses such as rentals, arcades, event providers and content creators. My goal would be to create a specialty directory site, not dissimilar to something like TripAdvisor, but focused 100% on Virtual Reality. Businesses would be able to list themselves for free, and users would go on the site, find the type of VR business they were interested in, leave reviews and book appointments directly from my site. As the site would get more users on it, I would create a paid membership tier that would allow businesses to highlight themselves in search, publish a larger number of events, etc.… Thus ExploreVR.net was born. I was the founder, the guy responsible for all the successes and the failures of the project. ‍"," Me. I was the cause of failure. Or more precisely my lack of experience in creating a business from scratch. Life in the corporate world doesn’t prepare you for that. I was overwhelmed by the number of new and unfamiliar activities, and I also lacked many critical skills. Learning the required skills while the project was already in-flight proved fatal to its success. While I did end up learning the skills in the process of doing, it messed with the correct sequencing of major phases of business creation. What I mean by that is researching the market should come prior to product creation. In my case, it was the other way around.  It’s embarrassing, but what can you do ) Drilling further into the cause of failure of ExploreVR.net, I can attribute it to several major reasons. Reason 1 – I completely lacked any understanding of how to carry out market research. I simply didn’t have the skills or the requisite background of facts to figure out the supply-demand equation, and whether a business with a compelling enough USP can be created in this niche. In addition to that, the concept of business positioning was completely alien to me. In essence, I created a business that competed head-on for the same customers as Yelp and Google. That reason alone is enough to sink most startups. Reason 2 – I had no business promotion skills. When I started the project, I literally had no idea about the strategies and techniques that can be employed to help customers find you. My marketing game was a fail. Prior to the start of the project, I had heard of SEO and things like keyword research, but I had no idea how to put together a cohesive strategy to attract customers. I am embarrassed to say this, but I attempted to “retrofit” marketing to an existing product. Oyyyyyy vey… (face palm). Reason 3 – Underestimating the technical difficulty of the project. As I mentioned earlier, I do have a tech background, so I thought I could produce a top-notch WordPress based app within a reasonable amount of time. Well, right now I can, but back then I couldn’t. Reason 4 – Having an extreme product-focus. Because I was so in the technical weeds of the project it put my focus basically 100% on the product instead of the customer. Major fail. I had built a site that I wanted to see, without giving much thought or evidence if it’s something my potential clients even wanted. It turns out, they didn’t. But I didn’t have the skills or the insight to find that out in advance of building the product. Reason 5 – Not talking to prospective customers early enough. This ties in very closely with the other reasons I listed. Had I actually tuned into the customer conversations earlier in the process, I probably would not have ever built ExploreVR.net. I didn’t spend enough time identifying the problem areas that were pertinent in this niche. Nor did I have a good enough of a gauge to figure out the extent of the pain, and the customer’s willingness to solve that set of problems. The realization that the project was doomed came on gradually.  As I started to educate myself on marketing and digital service creation, the dots started to connect. It was not an overnight realization, but more of a slow coming to terms. As a business owner, one of the hardest things to do is to maintain an objective outlook. Passion for your product is actually a detriment in some sense because it blinds you and causes a distorted perception of reality. Once objectivity set in I realized that success was not in the cards because my business was built around a faulty premise. The problem with my site was that users simply didn’t care to be on it. The few visitors that I had only stayed briefly, and most never came back. I did get some people to sign up for the free tier, but they found the site of limited utility, so the decision to abandon the project was kind of obvious. By the time I was finished with getting the site to work and look in the way intended it to, I realized that there is no need to continue. The thing was dead on arrival. I did everything I could and learned a ton in the process, so moving on was easy. ‍"," One challenge that I had run into that I didn’t previously consider is platform loyalty. It’s a royal pain in the ass to get people off the platform that they are already using and to get them to start using something else. There are a number of reasons why that is the case, but the most important one is that you are going directly against the platform’s investment of keeping their users right where they are. The Facebooks of the world invest hundreds of millions to make people stay in-app for as long as possible and actively work to discourage switching to a direct competitor or the use of alternatives. Another factor that made ExploreVR.net an impossible business was timing. Bill Gross says that timing is the single most important factor in the success or failure of a company. When I started ExploreVR.net I felt that the timing was spot on, but the more I got into the project the more I realized that I was about 2 years too late. Later on, I learned about the Technology Hype Cycle model (which I highly recommend that anyone working with emerging technologies studies) and it just crystalized exactly how late I was to the party. My gut tells me that if I built the same exact site two years prior, it would have been successful even in spite of every mistake I committed. That’s right, a better timing would have changed everything. Jumping in the same exact niche earlier would have given me the time to correct my mistakes. Very often it’s far more important to be first, to define the category. Two years ago, I would have had a shot at becoming the biggest site of its kind and delivering value to the users. But I entered the market too late, and as such couldn’t put together a compelling value proposition. As a wet behind the ears startup founder, I was out of touch with the element of timing. Finally, I’d like to point out one supposedly critical thing that was not a factor – money. I made a decision to be self-financed. To this day I firmly hold the belief that having or not having money doesn’t solve the fundamental business problems. Problems like, you know, your customers not wanting your product…. Would Plankton’s Chum Bucket be a big hit with Bikini Bottom residents if he had 10 branches and a $50 million dollars operating budget?  No, because he didn't sell Krabby Patties. Also, as the Founder and CEO, you need to be ready to handle money.  This is especially true if we are talking about outside capital.  What assurances do your investors have that you won’t just squander the cash on stupid stuff? Go and learn with your own money. The magnitude of the lessons learned when playing with your own cash on the line will make you into a stronger business person. You will learn just how irrational you can behave when there is skin in the game. Raising money when you have a solid product that customers want, and a management team that knows what they are doing is not a problem.",,,," ExploreVR.net was built in WordPress. I started out with a super basic list of requirements. I was going to have a spreadsheet where I would keep all the data about the businesses, and then I would figure out a way to present that data through WordPress as a website. Each row in the spreadsheet would a separate entry on the website. Those were my Version 1.0 requirements. Later on, I would add forms to the site where users could go to list their business, as well as adding a bunch of other functionality. Initially, I build the site using a listing engine called Connections Pro. At the time, my knowledge of the WordPress eco-system was very poor, so I kind of went with the first thing that sort of fit the description. Unfortunately, my initial choice of the listing engine couldn’t do about half the things that I later discovered were necessary, so after investing 2-3 months of work into Connections Pro, I had to switch to another engine. It was really hard to walk away from a site that I’d been pouring my all into, but I realized that it was necessary, so I ended up re-doing the site in much more modern listing engine called Listify. It was totally worth it because this engine could do things like logins with social network accounts, it was fully responsive and mobile-first, and in general, it was a big step up. The one thing that I did correctly at the outset of the project was to settle on a building methodology. I knew that my set of requirements was fuzzy, so I decided to go with something called the Agile approach. Basically what that means is that I would start with version 1.0 that was super-bare bones, and I would work in small increments to improve it and add features. Doing it this way would allow me to always have a ready (although imperfect) product on hand that I could show to people. Going with this approach helped me avoid the trap of waiting forever to release a product. A little company called Microsoft is famous for utilizing this approach. It’s basically the process of incremental product improvement over time. Besides myself, I did have a co-contributor who helped me with working on the site. I partnered up with a designer who helped me with creating graphics such as the logo and helping with some appearance tweaks, like deciding on the right typology, color palette, etc. Later in the project when I had the need to populate the site, I hired a contractor through Upwork.com to do it. This person did some manual content scraping for me, as well as created many listings. That also helped a lot. One of my cardinal mistakes (due to inexperience) was grossly underestimating how long it would take to get to an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) that was ready for public use. I was stumbling upon one hidden requirement after another. And it took a lot of time and effort to figure out certain technical issues. One of my major frustrations with the business is that it forced me into the trap of being a webmaster. That part I legitimately hated because I felt like it was cutting into the time that I should have been spending on marketing and promoting my product. Ascertaining the technical difficulty of getting something done is hugely important. But…it was a lesson that had to be learned the hard way, I guess. All told, I kept the costs of the project very low. Because it was a self-financed operation and because I did most of the development myself using off-the-shelf components, I only spent around $5,000-6,000 on the project. Interestingly enough, the bulk of that budget was spent on food. Yep, because I wanted to spend every waking minute working on my business, my takeout bill went through the roof. Other than that, I did spend a portion of the money on software licenses and business incorporation. But nothing too bad.",," My primary motivation to start ExploreVR.net was to create a highly profitable online business. Inspired by the successes of sites like Airbnb, Yelp, and TripAdvisor, I became very keen on the idea of User Generated Content (such as product reviews) as a source of providing value to customers. I thought that if I married some basic information about VR businesses with some user generated content, I couldn’t help but win. I believe that people appreciate having a central “hub” location where there is a lot of user content on a specific topic along the lines of old-school messaging boards and sites like Reddit. My initial hope was that my topic was niche and timely enough to not have any well-established players already in it. In early 2017 I volunteered on a grassroots political campaign as a member of their technology team. These guys were doing something I thought was pretty neat. They were using WordPress with a few customizations to create a full-featured online app. So that got me thinking – I have a core business idea for a product, and a low-cost means of creating that product, possibly all by myself. I made the connection between those two things in my mind and got to work. I didn’t have any previous WordPress experience, but I thought – “this can’t be that hard”. And it wasn’t that hard. Just time-consuming. So, I went for it. I knew right out of the gate that my chances of success as a first-time entrepreneur were against me, so I decided to do it part-time while keeping my day job. That was a good decision. My standard of living (financially) didn’t suffer, and I got to follow my dream at the same time. That was great. ‍",,," Check out my personal blog! If you are reading this, and something I had said has resonated with you, make sure you leave a comment or drop me a note."," I read a ton and I always try to seek out information that would make me better in areas that are critical to entrepreneurs, specifically marketing, selling, product creation, consumer psychology, team management, and negotiations. Currently, I am exploring the angle of business literature that treats people as emotional and irrational actors. Right now, I am reading “Never Split The Difference: How To Negotiate As If Your Life Depends On It” by Chris Voss. It’s a very cool book written by a former FBI hostage negotiator and it’s full of little tactical gambits that you can bring with you into any area of business to raise up your emotional intelligence. I read tons of (good) books, take lots of courses, and follow many blogs and podcasts. Actually, I maintain an updated list of all that stuff on my personal blog site. If you are interested go and check it out at AndreyNorin.com! ‍"," As I’ve stated before, my total expenses were somewhere in the neighborhood of $6,000. I kept the project costs low because I did most of the work myself. Project duration was about 6 to 8 months, from inception to until I realized that shutting it down was the only way to go. If you had to start over, what would you do differently? To be entirely honest with you Rich, I would not change a thing. You need a foundation of experiences, plain and simple. Starting and failing with ExploreVR.net was just how I paid my entrepreneurial dues. Having said that, if I were to do it over I would: Spend as much time on market research as I did on product creation. Spending 3 months on niche research and testing, doing customer conversations, figuring out how to build a product that customers want and need. Had I done that market research properly I would have never built ExploreVR.net.Come up with a better name! ExploreVR.net was a horrible name for many reasons. For one thing, it’s difficult to remember and easy to forget. There is no embedded benefit in the company name. And under no circumstances should a product that you build end in anything other than a .com, especially if there is already another site with that name. Naming is so very important.Spend much less time trying to be a webmaster. In the future, if I decide to do a similar project I will focus on the marketing research, and then once I’ve nailed that down I will raise the money to hire developers. Or maybe bring on-board a more technical co-founder. Product creation is difficult and time consuming. It cuts into the time you have for important business activities. During the time that I was engrossed in the project, I was quite worried about having to admit failure to my family. It was a totally irrational thing, as I am a fairly successful guy. But there I was, feeling anxiety about telling them that I am entered a new business, and then having to tell them a few months later that it went belly up. Sometimes you just gotta learn what not to do. ‍",Software & Hardware,Lack of Experience,United States,"April 27, 2018",Andrey Norin,https://www.failory.com/interview/explorevr,['http://andreynorin.com/'],failure,0,,"Andrey Norin is a budding entrepreneur, responsible for all the successes and the failures of ExploreVR.

67,fantastic-house-buyers," Hi, I’m Alan from the UK and my background is in business analysis, mainly for global organizations. Last year I decided to give this up and launch my own start-up which ultimately failed and I’m currently in the process of validating my next startup Flow Metrics. This came from wanting to reduce the amount of time I was spending finding and extracting information from Google Analytics during my failed startup Fantastic House Buyers, which I’m delighted to be able to talk to you about today! Fantastic House Buyers was an online service designed to improve the expensive and stressful experience of buying a house here in the UK. The premise was simple: a digital assistant that helped house buyers through the process and provided everything they needed in one place, including recommendations of professionals they would need during the process. I was the sole founder and employee on this and financed it myself. The business model was to take commission from recommending professional services and it seemed like a no-brainer with low operating costs and high potential revenue per user meant I only needed a small number of users to make it profitable. In hindsight, I committed a rookie mistake that led to its failure before it generated any revenue, one that should have been apparent and solvable from that start but took me a while to realize. ‍"," This is a tough one to answer honestly. I spent quite a bit of time reflecting on this and it was difficult to admit that my main cause of failure was building something that no-one wanted! If you read anything about starting a business you’ll quickly find that the main reason for failure is exactly this, however, it’s quite difficult to really appreciate this until you’ve made the mistake yourself. I realized that it wasn’t going to work as the users that were signing up just weren’t interacting with the site enough and return visits were very low. This, in turn, meant I couldn’t generate any revenue, this wasn’t necessarily an issue as operating costs were low but what finally made me shut it down was one key question: Would I use my own product? My honest answer was no, I wouldn’t - which seems a strange thing to say. I had big ideas and plans about what I wanted it to be and I certainly would have used the final product, however, the minimum product I launched just didn’t solve a pressing issue. This was my main learning, make sure your product is solving a problem and that you can identify a market for it before you commit much time or money to building it. If I’m honest I felt disappointed when I shut the site down. I’d invested a lot of time and effort in building it and didn’t want this to go to waste so it was a tough decision to finally shut it down. I’d read so many stories about the importance of persevering so it was difficult to know whether to keep going or admit that it wasn’t going to work. I’m happy that I made the right decision in the end and I’m now treating it as a learning exercise to take into my next venture. In fact, my next venture actually came out of a problem I identified while trying to market and grow fantastic house buyers! ‍"," Having thought about this a lot I can put the mistakes that led to the failure of fantastic house buyers down to one main thing: not validating the idea before launching, unfortunately, this is something I should have realized at the outset. A lot of challenges can be overcome but not having a market for your product can only end one way! Having been through the start-up process I now realize how important it is to build something that is genuinely solving a significant problem for a significant amount of people. I set out to build a product that I thought I would want, and without a clear vision of the problem I was solving, and who I was solving it for, my chances of succeeding were very slim from the start. The great thing about this experience is that all I lost was time rather than a significant amount of money, instead of seeing this as time lost I see it as a valuable learning experience to take forward to my next venture. While marketing fantastic house buyers I spent an awful lot of time on Google Analytics, sometimes 1-2 hours a day trying to understand what my users were doing, how many were converting and where I needed to improve my marketing and sales funnel, or where I could potentially generate revenue through affiliate marketing. I was spending so much time on this that I built a visitor analytics function into the fantastic house buyers admin (I was already utilizing user tracking so it was essentially a rough and ready front end to show me the numbers and info I needed, rather than having to dig through GA and plug it into spreadsheets). While dissecting the failure of fantastic house buyers I realized that this was a pain point I had solved for myself and others may also want something like this so they can spend more time on their business and less time trying to gather the insight they need. This time, instead of worrying about the features and writing the code I’m fully validating the idea first. To do this I’ve put together some rough mock-ups of what I think the product would look like and have a landing page where people can sign up, I’ll only develop this further once I’ve hit a certain number of sign-ups and know that there is enough interest in my product. You can find the landing page here and I’d be really interested to hear what your readers think. (Note that I’ve not even committed to a product or domain name until I’ve validated the idea!) I also think there are a couple of secondary reasons fantastic house buyers failed, I think these could have been overcome but certainly didn’t help: Poor choice of the market: In hindsight, the UK property market is currently being disrupted by a number of online real estate agents which are significantly undercutting traditional estate agents. These currently only account for around 5% of the market and the remaining 95% is quite conservative and skeptical of technology that could reduce their income, making it very difficult to get traction. There is also a lack of online communities and influencers, with 2 huge property portals serving most consumer needs. For my next venture, I’m very much focusing on the tech/start-up world where I think there is a much more supportive community and an inherent culture of embracing new opportunities and products.Lack of industry experience: Again, I don’t think this an obstacle that cannot be overcome but choosing an industry I had no real knowledge or experience of for my first start-up only served to make it more challenging. While I don’t have a deep knowledge of the market for my next venture it is at least one I have experienced for myself and where I can better understand the challenges and problem I’m trying to solve from my customers point of view.",,,," I didn’t have much money to invest in my idea, but I did have a lot of time so I decided I’d build it myself and keep the costs and risk low. I set aside 6 months where I’d cover my day to day living costs from my savings and re-assess my options after then. While I was by no means a developer I had done bits and pieces of coding and been exposed to software development in a few of my previous jobs so my first task was to build on this and learn how to build and launch an online platform. I figured that worst case scenario I’d at least learn a new and useful skill. I decided to stick with the Microsoft stack that I had some familiarity with, I even found that Microsoft run a program for startups that offer free software and credits for their Azure cloud service so I enrolled in this and set about building fantastic house buyers – the great thing is this meant my set-up costs were close to £0, how could I possibly fail! I already had a rough idea of the product that I wanted to build and I immediately set out defining what the final product should be and build it. In hindsight, this was one of my fatal mistakes, instead of focusing on the problem I was solving and identifying the market for it I set about building something I thought I’d want and focused on the product rather than the problem and who would use it. On reflection, I did spend quite a bit of time agonizing over this at the start. I ultimately decided I wouldn’t know what the product was until I’d built it and would find it hard explaining to people what it was. This really should have been a red flag and is a good lesson that I learned, if you can’t explain your product to someone and the problem it’s solving then you need to work this out before you spend any time on product development or writing code. I’ve always been quite a technical person but had never really considered that I would be able to code something myself so I was quite proud that I managed to build the entire back end, front end and database myself in around 6 months and thought the end product was pretty good. I did quite enjoy the challenge of working out how to solve coding and design problems and learning a new skill, however, as I was working solo I also found it a little frustrating at times not having anyone to run ideas and challenges past. This did have a positive side though in that it really taught me how to identify and focus on the important tasks and ignore the noise (something you don’t really learn to truly appreciate when working in a large organization). I quietly launched the initial version of the site in August 2017 but I had no real idea how to market my product and get users. I ended up having some success with paid adverts on Facebook and Google but I found it really difficult to achieve much traffic organically, this was mainly because the vast majority of people visited two main property portals here in the UK that were very difficult to compete with in terms of content marketing and SEO. ‍",," I’d always had the idea that I’d like to try running my own business, though I’d never really thought about exactly what this meant or what kind of business. Over the last couple of years, I’d started to become disillusioned with the corporate/business world that I’d been working in for the last 15 years. Last summer I decided this wasn’t a long-term option for me so I quit my job and took the plunge to launch my own startup business. Having recently been through the process of buying a house I’d had the seed of an idea to build a platform that helps house buyers, I was amazed at how disjointed and difficult the process was and I guess my idea was to build a kind of LinkedIn for house buying, something that would provide the advice and guidance on what to do when buying a house, would connect you with professionals and allow you to manage everything all in one place. A lot of the jobs I’d held were around analyzing and improving processes for organizations and I wanted to apply this to something myself so this seemed like a good opportunity to do so. On a personal level, I guess I also wanted more flexibility about how and when I worked and believed launching my own startup would offer this too. I really had no idea about how to launch a business or what to do, however, I learned pretty quickly the importance of diving in and giving it a go! It’s important to be prepared and do your research, but at some point, you just need to get out there, make the mistakes and learn from them for the next time! ‍"," This one’s easy! Put down the laptop and not write a single line of code until I’ve identified the problem I’m solving and can potentially sell my solution to someone right now! The other thing I would say is to pick something I’m passionate about. I didn’t fully appreciate the difference between starting a business on your own and having a team of colleagues to fall back on when you work for someone else. I think finding something that doesn’t necessarily feel like work would make it easier during the tough times and make you more likely to stick to it. I really enjoy solving problems and I have an interest in coding and design (enjoying something doesn’t necessarily make you good at it!) and I find these enjoyable so tend to focus my efforts on these. I’ve learned that it’s equally important to focus on the aspects that I’m not so good at it, like the sales and marketing side, and for my next venture will be focusing a lot more time and effort on these. One of the things that held me back at the start was worrying about not knowing what I was doing and the fear of getting it wrong or negative feedback. I quickly learned that you can’t beat just jumping in and trying something and that’s a great way for me to learn, my mantra now is just do it! You might get it wrong or fail, but if you don’t try then you definitely will fail. Finally, I’d be tempted to find a co-working space or office to work from at least once a week as having a change of scenery or a supportive community was something I felt I missed during this project.  "," I started out with social media and aimed to grow my followers on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Pinterest hoping this would drive traffic to my site and generate some users. This never really worked out for me though and I quickly discovered that Pinterest wasn’t really relevant to my audience. LinkedIn and Twitter were useful for connecting with people and finding contacts in the industry but drove very little relevant traffic to my site. I did try paying for some promoted posts on Twitter but I didn’t find this an effective channel. Facebook didn’t really work organically either but I had quite a bit of success with Facebook ads. At first, the results weren’t very good but after experimenting with my adverts I started to get a bit of traction. I was getting a couple of thousand clicks a month for about £100 so I thought I’d hit a winning strategy, all I had to do was pay for more adverts and I’d get more users! As you can imagine, this didn’t happen. Although I was getting visitors my bounce rate was high and sign-ups were very low, those that did sign up never really came back and it dawned on me that the traffic I was getting wasn’t targeted, it was people seeing an advert and having a look at what the site was but realistically most of them weren’t my target customers and I’d be unlikely to convert them. I then moved on to trying Google Adwords as I thought this would provide more targeted traffic since people were already searching for the terms I was advertising for. I got some success this way and around 20% of visitors from this source were demonstrating an interest and around 5% were signing up, which would have given me enough revenue to keep going. I also found that my click-through rates were consistently between 5 and 10% which I thought was pretty good. My main issue here was that the cost per click was pretty high since there was a lot of competition from big established companies for the keywords I was targeting. I did a lot of research into marketing strategies and tried most of the tried and tested methods but none of them seemed to work which was another clue that my product wasn’t solving a problem for enough people. I tried content marketing and wrote a few blog posts and created some useful tools such as a mortgage calculator and managed to get some traffic to these, again it was mainly paid though. I found it difficult to find relevant sites to link back to mine and with a couple of big sites already dominating the keywords competing with SEO was really difficult. I also tried reaching out to influencers and generating some press coverage but there were very few people operating in this area and I soon realized that marketing was going to be an uphill battle or require significant investment."," You can find out more about my next venture flow metrics on my personal website, as I’m currently validating this idea I’d love to hear what your readers think! You can also find me on Twitter, I’m always interested to hear from new people and especially people involved in the tech or start-up world or people running their own blog or business so feel free to get in touch!"," Tool: I used Google Analytics a lot, I think it’s vital to analyze and understand your visitors so you know what to improve. Google Keyword Planner is great for finding the keywords you want to rank for in your SEO efforts, whether you’re going for paid ads or organic traffic. Blogs: I love the Bare Metrics blog and the concise and insightful guides they have for pretty much everything, I also love the open start-up aspect. There are a number of other blogs I dip into but Neil Patel is one I come back to often for ideas on content marketing.  Design Inspiration: Product Hunt and Dribbble are excellent for finding new tools and design inspiration. Coding Resources: The community at Stack Overflow is amazing and I used it extensively for solving coding problems, I don’t think there’s anything that you can’t solve there! I also found CSS Tricks to be a great resource for learning how to achieve a lot of my front-end design. Books: I’m currently reading Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares, which covers a lot of different growth channels and contains some great examples. I also liked a lot of the principles in The 7 Day Startup: You Don't Learn Until You Launch by Dan Norris, this really helped me to focus on the important tasks when launching a start-up and getting stuff done! ‍"," Luckily, I didn’t lose much apart from my own time and my main costs were my own living costs, I’ll count this as time well spent if it contributes to the success of a future venture! In terms of costs, this is roughly what I spent: Web hosting: Free – I signed up for Microsoft’s program offering free credits and software to start-up companies, this gave me £115 credits for Azure cloud service which was more than enough to host my website and database etc.Web domains: £30. I bought 4 domains and 1 SSL certificate, one of which I renewed recently in case I wanted to continue.Marketing: This was my main cost, I haven’t tallied up the final figures but reckon I invested maybe £250-£500 in paid advertising for both Facebook and Google Adwords.   Aside from that, I think my only other costs were for things like a new laptop and monitor (I’d always had one supplied by work previously) and some small pieces of office furniture for my home-office. I still make use of these though so I guess they weren’t necessarily a business cost. In terms of time, I think I probably spent about 6 months full time on this in total. This includes a few months working on it in my spare time and maybe 2-3 times working on it full time after I’d quit my day job. Unfortunately, I didn’t manage to generate any revenue from this. ‍",Services,No Market Need,United Kingdom,"May 21, 2018",Alan Murray,https://www.failory.com/interview/fantastic-house-buyers,"['https://www.alanmmurray.com/flowmetrics', 'https://twitter.com/alanmmurray']",failure,0,,"Fantastic House Buyers was an online service designed to improve the expensive and stressful experience of buying a house in the UK.

68,feedcheck," I’m Adrian, the founder of FeedCheck, a business that helps consumer brands to analyze customer reviews from the Internet. I am 31 and I live in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. I am passionate about tech businesses. I constantly explore tech ideas. Before the COVID crisis, I was present at most local tech events. Besides tech, I like to cook and ride my bicycle. ‍",," I think the biggest challenge was waiting a long time until the first paying customer. The team morale was not so good, so the first customer was a great event. For us, this brought validation that the product was desired.  Another challenge was when a key member of our team decided to leave the company before break even.  We also implemented too late a customer feature request, which would have added more value. Usually, we add extra features to the application if they make sense for the product and the customer pays for them. Those were hard times in the beginning, but we succeeded even with these challenges. ",," Today, five years after the beginning, we have grown a lot. We have popular, global brands as customers (like Nestle, P&G, Fujitsu Computers), and we plan to add to our portfolio more enterprise customers.  We are considering growing the team to bring our services to more brands. Beyond the big names mentioned above, it is a constant effort to understand the needs of the consumer brands and build the best solution for them. ",," Since we discovered the need, we started to build FeedCheck, a solution for customer review analytics.  We started data acquisition, a field where we had experience. After we built the foundation, an engine capable of collecting customer reviews from any website, we started working at the next level, the analytics part.  Considering a review contains both numbers and text, we split the analytics into two parts quantitative and qualitative. We began with the quantitative part, the numbers and trends like star rating, evolution in time, reviews number, etc. In 2017 we signed a partnership with Microsoft and they offered us resources to develop the qualitative analytics of the reviews. We developed an AI for sentiment analytics and we divide the reviews into parts that mention specific features of products. This area allows brands to view which is their most loved feature and the less liked one. We responded to the question, “Why do our customers love/hate this product?” We attracted more and more customers who helped us understand their needs and develop the product further during development. One of the strategies we had at the release was not waiting for the perfect product. In tech and IT in general, developers tend to wait for the very best alternative of their product, and sometimes this can take months or years. There is an infinite loophole that you can fall into to find more and more possible ways to improve the product. And during this time, you can lose enthusiasm for the product or miss the opportunity on the market. In our case, we released the product as it was after a few months of working on it. We knew there was more to work on, but we felt it was the right moment to bring it out. This proved to be a good strategy, even if we still had to invest a lot of time in development, but this was more aligned with actual customer needs than with our supposed assumption of what they wanted. ",," In 2014, right after I finished my university studies, I launched a company that helped businesses with data acquisition.  In 2016 we started collaborating with a smartwatch company to help them add real-time data (like stock, weather, etc.) to the watch. Studying their needs, we discovered that they were missing a solution to consolidate all product reviews spread across many online stores. It was an AHA moment for us. At that moment, we realized that their need was not only their own and that we could build a product to be used by all types of consumer brands. We started to work at this and a few months later, we had an MVP."," Before FeedCheck, I started a few other products, but FeedChek was the most successful. FeedCheck had the first paying customer after more than six months, and we reached break-even after three years, so the lesson here is that patience is vital. I see entrepreneurs who want to build something and make a profit from the first year. I think valuable things are built with time. Your network and location are also important. We have some competitors located in the US, and we can see they have an advantage in attracting customers in the same country. "," After we launched the MVP version, we tried to grow the organic traffic on our own. We had no budget for SEM (Search Engine Marketing) or advertising, so we started with SEO (Search Engine Marketing) actions.  We built a list of startup directories and B2B app directories (like G2Crowd, Capterra, etc.) for link building. We published our site on every website on our list so that we could have some backlinks. We created a blog and we targeted some specific keywords like “review monitoring“. The results were outstanding. For some of the keywords, we reached top positions on Google.  Another tactic was to build a list with popular products like Apple products, tablets, wearables, and we created specific pages for each, presenting the customer view extracted from their reviews. For every product, we made a dedicated blog post with analytics of its reviews. This action produced some traffic, but the traffic wasn’t from our targeted customers (brands) it was from consumers interested to know more about the product they wanted to buy. This helped us to start without an advertising budget. We succeeded in creating a flow of organic traffic and even a stream of leads who came to us by our website contact form."," You can read more about FeedCheck on our website. I am present on all major social networks, but I consider the most relevant are my LinkedIn profile and my blog, where I plan to write more."," For a startup, there are many free tools that provide value. One of them is the Lean Canvas. We use it to evaluate new opportunities quickly.  We are using standard metrics for SaaS to evaluate how we perform and also compare with the market. I would avoid fancy analytics tools they provide the same information but with stunning colors in many cases. In terms of books, one of the most valuable for me related to this experience was The Four Steps to the Epiphany by Steve Blank.

69,festivilia," Hi Failories! !’m Tobi Ogunwande. I am 27 years old and a proud Nigerian based in Lagos, Nigeria. I love to describe myself as a lover of film, tech and good food. I have been interviewed on Failory based on my failed startup (Hubrif) an online video platform for streaming award-winning and curated African short films. You can call it a Netflix for African short films. I figured I should balance up the equation by talking about my current startup Festivilia which is quite successful and I credit its success based on the lessons and experience gained in running Hubrif. Festivilia is a film festival submission and distribution platform that allows filmmakers and content providers to submit their films to a curated list of film festivals with just 1 form. Festivilia acts as the Festival Distributor for its clients helping to scout, source, submit to film festivals as well as manage all communications between these festivals and our clients. Basically, Festivilia saves filmmakers money and invaluable time by only submitting their films to festivals they have a higher chance of being accepted in as well as making sure their time is spent on other productive activities rather than spent filling numerous submission forms. ‍",," With no background in software development and definitely very broke with no funds to hire a developer, I didn't know how I would build a platform by myself. I took up the challenge to research, read a lot of articles on website development, how to build an MVP, etc! Well, as they say, the rest is history.  Also, manually curating thousands of film festivals and carefully selecting the ones that are a perfect fit for Festivilia was a painstaking job. We spent a few months doing this. Well, it is still a painstaking job as we constantly research and add film festivals to our database.  One of our biggest mistakes was at the initial launch of Festivilia, we priced the service so low and this was a huge strain on us. We overpromised and in the bid to not disappoint our clients, we worked our ass off (Permit my language) to fulfill our promises. Because of this, we couldn't take any more clients for a few months for obvious reasons. If we had done that, we would have failed to deliver. This meant we lost money. Fast forward to today, we are happy we made such mistakes as this has helped refined our business model. I guess the popular saying “If you are not embarrassed with your product when you launched, then you launched too late” is true. ",," We are not just looking to build a marketplace for filmmakers and film festivals but build an automated and AI-powered platform that will totally make the submission of films to festivals seamless by cutting the time spent on this activity as much as we can so filmmakers can actively spend their time on other creative activities.  We also want film festivals to be accountable. The emergence of film festival submission platforms like filmfreeway and shortfilmdepot has made it very seamless for filmmakers to submit their films to festivals all in one place. This has made film festivals easily receive far more submissions than they would have imagined only a few years ago. film festivals that receive about 500 submissions annually now have access to receiving over 5000 submissions but for only 30-50 available spots. While this is beneficial to the festivals, it has also created a fraudulent system because these festivals most of the times end up not watching 50% of these submissions whereas they still got 100% submission fees from these filmmakers. We are building a secure marketplace system whereby filmmakers can easily see if a festival they paid an entry fee to actually watched their film. In the case where they the film wasn't watched, the entry fees paid by the filmmaker will be returned back to the entrant. We believe the film festival circuit should be a free and fair ground for both filmmakers and festivals alike. Our short-term goal is that we intend to sponsor an award category at a few partnered film festivals this year. Few film festivals have monetary award prices, we want to be able to contribute towards the growth of the careers of filmmakers. Filmmakers need funds to continue making films, this will be our own little way of being a part of their success stories.  ",," I didn’t want to go through the experience I had when I founded Hubrif. A summary of that experience was I had to find a technical co-founder who not only had the skill-set to build a VOD platform but also must love filmmaking. It took about 1 year to find that person. For Festivilia, I decided to take the bull by the horn. With all the tools out there today, I knew it shouldn’t be that hard to build an MVP on my own. I already laid out a template that will support the use of free tools and with little-no coding required. I found Mobirise - an offline website builder and was able to get a reliable free/cheap hosting plan (hub8), Canva was used to design my logo and in 3 weeks, I was able to build a decent MVP. In all, it cost me just $11 in total! (I only spent money to buy the domain). Back then, clients had to download the form, fill and email back to us and we would then send a payment invoice. The back and forth wasn’t good enough even though our customers never complained. I wanted a semi-automated system so I kept improving the workflow of the platform. Thanks to Airtable Forms which enabled us to build flexible cloud-based online forms (This replaced users having to download, fill and email back a form).  Thanks to Flutterwave and Paystack, we could integrate our payment invoices to our online forms with zero set-up fees). Google Sheets allows us to create beautiful and easy to understand festival tracking dashboards. We have a near perfect semi-automated system with minimal supervision today.",," The idea for Festivilia was inspired by 2 experiences. The first was with an encounter with an Egyptian filmmaker, Ramy El Gabry, in 2016 while I was still running Hubrif. The other was my personal experience with submitting my films to film festivals. I stumbled upon Ramy’s short film, From Inside, and was really moved by the storyline. I then reached out to the filmmaker to get the film featured on Hubrif and it became the most watched film on the platform at that time. From my years of attending film festivals, I felt the film would be a perfect match for some festivals and decided to submit the film on his behalf. To both our surprise the film was selected by almost all the film festivals that I had submitted it to, including the 2016 Africa International Film Festival where we both finally met. On one of the days of the festival, Ramy and I were discussing and then he said that what I did for him was a great service that many filmmakers would gladly pay for.  Fast forward 3 years later, Festivilia is the official Festival Distributor for all of Divine Touch Productions films (Ramy’s production company).  The second experience was that I have always had a problem with filling numerous submission forms of film festivals to submit my film to festivals. With an acceptance rate of less than 5%, I find the whole process very inefficient and time wasting. Over time, other submission platforms like filmfreeway and withoutabox made the process less frustrating by building a marketplace for filmmakers and film festival alike, but I realized the issue of time spent on these platforms sieving through different festivals rules and regulations to see which festivals your film is a perfect match for hasn't been close to being solved. I didn't want to spend 100 of hours monthly doing this activity but would rather find a platform that can help me do all the hard work (Source for the right festivals and submit on my behalf) and I pay for the service. There was none in existence. I decided to solve my problem. These 2 experiences were the fire that sparked the idea for Festivilia. ‍"," We have been fortunate to have been profitable from day 1. Our costs to build an MVP was extremely low and our current cost of running the platform is still low. In figures, we launched the platform with a total cost of $11 (Just to buy the domain). We currently spend around $20 monthly and this is sorely for internet data services. We are not incurring any expenses running the platform in itself. We have generated roughly $15,000 in revenue so far (From Subscription fees, VOD distribution deals and Commission on award prices with monetary values from film festivals) and currently doing about $250 in MRR (Sorely from subscription fees). I am pretty satisfied with how we launched. I wouldn’t change anything. I started Festivilia as a side project while still working at Cartehub as a Business Development Personnel. I have since left Cartehub and joined Divine Touch Productions an International production company headquartered in Egypt. Technically, Festivilia is still a side project as I work full-time remotely for Divine Touch. ‍"," We have sorely grown through referrals and word of mouth. We have generated over $15,000 in revenue since our launch 10 months ago. When we launched, we were fortunate to get enough buzz from blogs and media outlets in Nigeria and South Africa.  We have sorely leveraged on this and built our reputation from such buzz. We also have just begun to take our SEO seriously. Blogging was a great resource for us and gradually helped us build a community but unfortunately, we had issues with our blogging platform and lost all of our contents so we had to start blogging afresh. Thanks to the amazing guys at publishnow for building an amazing blogging tool, we are now back to blogging. Recognition from filmmakers happened after we appeared on the front page of the 2018 September edition of Screen Africa Magazine. ‍", Need my help?

I can also be reached via email.," Firstly, let me chip in a piece of advice for budding techpreneurs. Forget about startup incubators, VC funding and all those noises you already know about. I spent a lot of time on these things when I was running Hubrif and trust me, the outcome was not as good as we thought. It was an emotion-draining activity. Rather, spend time building your startup and get in touch with your specific target audience. Figure out a way to begin making money from day 1. If it’s too expensive to set up an MVP, it’s probably not a good idea. Goodluck! I am a big fan of Failory and IndieHackers. I love to discover new products on Hacker News, Betalist and Betapage.

70,fibery," Hi! I’m Michael, a 42-year old entrepreneur from Belarus. I started my first company (Targetprocess) in 2004, and in 2021 it was acquired by Apptio. Fibery is my second company that I founded in 2017. We are building a second brain for teams. Our goal is to help teams accumulate knowledge, generate insights and manage work processes in a single tool. As you see, I like marathons :)  Till 2021 we were a Belarusian company but now transformed into a remote company without a remote office and with 24 people in 5 countries. We raised $3.1M as a seed round recently, and our current MRR is $24K/month. Here is the best Fibery explainer we have.  ‍",," We didn’t really think about the narrow market niche for Fibery till the official release. It took us 3 years to nail the niche and deliver something specifically for this niche. Overgeneralization may work if you have huge budgets, but if you don’t, then focusing on a niche is your only choice. I think this was the main mistake we made. We spent the first several months just prototyping and playing with various technologies. We manage to solve all major technological problems, but we may face more with growth. These are good problems to have, but I still wonder how Fibery will survive large 1000 people accounts in the future. The real challenge was a company separation. Fibery was an internal project first, and it was extremely hard to spin it off as an independent company. It took more than 2 years and endless negotiations. At some point, Fibery was close to death (and it was even announced to the team), but we survived, separated, and cleaned our cap table to get the seed round. I definitely don’t want to have this experience again. ",," As I already mentioned, we found product/market fit, and our main goal is to grow the business to ~$1M ARR in 2022. This is a bold goal, but I hope we will get 2-3 customers acquisition channels to work efficiently (finally). My best hopes are the Partners network and Startup program (we give Fibery for free for 1 year if a startup has revenue less than Fibery). We have 100 active startups using Fibery, and they should start to convert into paid customers in 2022. We have 24 people on board and plan to hire 2 more in marketing (Head of Marketing and Educator). Now I handle the Head of Marketing responsibilities, but it is hard to do that effectively since CEO responsibilities suffer.  ",," We started from some conceptual ideas back in 2017. It was just a presentation of a possible future that I showed to 15 Targetprocess customers and got very positive feedback. Looking back, I’m not sure this feedback was super valuable since our customers were somewhat biased :) Then we had several challenging technical problems that we tried to solve. For example, how to allow people to build a flexible domain for their company? We created several prototypes, tried all possible databases (including Graph, NoSQL, etc.), and it appeared that Postgres was the best choice. We also chose Clojure as a core language, which is a weird choice, but it gave us the needed flexibility to do various transformations faster. There were many technical problems since the goal was very ambitious and bold.  Fibery start was slow, the first prototype that could be demoed to people appeared after 8 months of development, and private beta was released in 2019 after 24 months of development. Looking back, we could do it in 20 months since some scope additions were not necessary. But scoping is always hard. We onboarded several hundred teams, but the churn was pretty high. Fibery was in private beta for more than a year. We listened to early users and improved the product till the public launch in April 2020. It was a pretty successful launch we got product of the day on PH and some virality. It took us more than 3 years to launch publicly and start revenue-generating. This is very unusual in the B2B SaaS space, but I don’t think we could do it much faster since the complexity of the problem can’t be reduced easily.  After the launch, we monitored early customers and saw who sticks better. We discovered that Fibery churn for product teams was lower and focused on product development processes more. In February 2021, we released Fibery for Product Teams, and now we have more than 50 product companies among our customers.  Our main problem is that Fibery is very flexible and can be used for almost any industry, but from the product/market fit point of view, it is almost always better to focus on some specific niche. We found product-market fit in the product companies niche since our annual churn here is less than 15%. ",," We have a somewhat unusual story. Fibery was born as a research project inside Targetprocess. We decided to explore the future of work management, and I led a team of 5 people to dig into this problem for about 6 months. I already had deep experience in this domain, and we accumulated tons of feedback at Targetprocess, so we started from scratch essentially.  After the first 6 months, we decided to build something cool and innovative and switched from prototyping to development.   Our main goal was to create a tool that could grow with the company. Most tools can’t survive the growth, and a company has to switch them. Our idea was to create flexible software that consists of several building blocks that you can assemble for your process.  It appeared, we were working on a no-code approach for building internal collaborative tools, but we did not know that when we started."," I’ll put them in a list good for tweets: A narrow niche is important. You have to think about the market and target persona very early. This is hard for technical founders, but it will simplify everything, from product scope to marketing.Sales channels are more important than you think. Set experiments and execute them. Focus on 1-2 channels at once and make sure they don’t work for you till you move on.Release in public in less than 12 months (if possible). Try really hard to reduce the scope and make it happen. Developing a new product without real feedback is very hard emotionally, early release can help you reduce the uncertainty and find “your way” faster. "," We tried many things :)  Product Hunt launches are good for attracting investors and potential customers, but in reality, we had many registrations (1,000-2,000 every launch) but very few conversions to actual customers. Fibery is quite complex for inbound marketing channels, but we understood that only recently. One of the best things we did was this funny Yet another collaboration tool landing. It was on top of HN and generated tons of positive feedback. Many people find our humor refreshing, and it helped us get some vitality and trust.   Content marketing is something we are doing authentically as well. I write monthly progress reviews with all the numbers and all failures. Sometimes they are fun to read, and many people praise our articles. Few posts got to the HN top. We tried to collaborate with one of the best content agencies in the world, but they failed to deliver good content. On average, we have about 7-8K page views in the blog every month, and it is hard to say that numbers were growing last year. We tried CPC, and it took us 6 months to have good leads flow, but conversion is still bad. It was tough to define an activation metric for Fibery, but it seems we nailed it. We want to improve the onboarding process to improve the activation rate.  We tried to set up an outreach channel with two agencies. The first one generated zero calls, the second one is doing slightly better, and we had 3 calls last month. To make it viable, we should have around 20 calls and 5-10 sales. The experiment is still in progress. We started a Partners program a few months ago and already have 20 active partners. They truly believe in Fibery and are very enthusiastic to onboard new companies and help them with the processes set up and evolution. We don’t have any clear results from the partners yet, but I think this can be the most significant channel for Fibery in 2022. I think word of mouth is our main channel so far. Our existing customers recommend Fibery, and this is a very good sign. But since our customers’ base is not large yet, the growth is quite slow we grew from $80K to $290K ARR in 2021.", We have a very decent blog. I recommend checking the gems section with the best articles we wrote. You can follow me on Twitter. And there are plenty of videos on our Youtube channel.," Here are the top 5 books I can recommend to any entrepreneur: 1. Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey A. Moore to nail the positioning and first years of the startup. 2. The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick to learn how to really talk to users and do customer discovery calls. 3. Creativity, Inc. by Ed Catmull to build genius company culture. 4+5. Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi + How to Cook Your Life by Dōgen to learn how to live your life and do things. They should be read together.  These books influenced me greatly in the last couple of years. For any B2B SaaS company, I recommend Intercom, Loom, Slack, and Fibery. We use these tools extensively and they really help us.

Now I’m very clear about the people I want to work with, as they’re representing my business and need to have the same hard-working approach and vision I have or it just won’t work.  I try to see the mistakes of my team and me as learnings and something to be grateful for. Without them, we wouldn’t be where we are today. There are so many things I could have done differently from the start but we are all just doing the best with the information we have available at the time. Every CEO is a work in progress and I’m always reading and learning how to become the best leader I can be. ‍",," Financer.com today is a thriving global business with a team of passionate intrapreneurs behind it. However, we’re always striving for more and are far from the finish line of where we plan to grow to.  We’re currently based in 26 markets and will be growing this soon, including some of the harder to infiltrate markets such as the UK where there is a high barrier to entry. As the markets we serve grow so will our team and I’ll continue to hire through the intrapreneurship model which has been very successful for us.  As well as building on what is already working well for us, improving our content and working with new affiliate networks we also have some new ideas in the works. The sky is the limit and we look forward to hitting new milestones, breaking down doors, and taking Financer.com to new places. ‍",," I didn’t overcomplicate the journey or search for investment when I started Financer.com because I knew what I was doing and how to build a website and affiliate income. I focused on exactly what I did best, SEO, and I took my time building up the different country sites and a remote team. This method worked out well, and today Financer is represented in 26 markets around the world. There were, of course, obstacles along the way, but this usually came down to ignoring the lesson I had learned previously, focusing on my key idea. I experimented with other industries, such as gambling, but quickly realized I was better off concentrating on financial education and comparison. That was what our readers came to us for, so that’s what we continue to give them.",," I had already been experimenting with affiliate marketing and creating websites for quite a few years before I started Financer.com. I had created 400 websites and trialed different kinds of monetization for them, such as Google ads, and confirmed to myself this was what I wanted to do long-term.  But I didn’t have a real focus because I hadn’t found an idea I was passionate about yet until I created Financer.com. I could see how much value it was giving to people, which was a huge motivation to turn it into something bigger. I had a vision for a global business model with websites in different countries, but it was clear the only way to make all of this happen was to let go of some of my other projects and do what I had never done before: focus.  This turned out to be a huge turning point for the business and I now advise any entrepreneurs out there who are balancing lots of projects but not feeling fulfilled to choose the one they care about most and give it 100%.  "," One of the lessons I learned since starting Financer.com is to keep networking and building your connections. When I lived in my hometown, I didn’t have a tribe of business people around me, so I searched for that in Malta and then around the world as a digital nomad. I quickly saw how much value there is in networking and believe it's been extremely beneficial to my business. Now that I’m based in Cyprus I continue to grow my network and say yes to opportunities where I can connect with entrepreneurs from all walks of life.  I’ve also learned to stay true to the reasons I wanted to start a business in the first place. There was a time when I had created for myself the exact 9-5 job I was trying to avoid, so I had to go back to basics and think about what I wanted from my business. Now I work flexibly to suit my schedule and I hire intrapreneurs who are independent and growth focussed. They don’t need constant watching over and we’re all working towards the same vision.  "," Most of the Financer’s success comes down to good SEO knowledge and passion. As a team, we’re all passionate about the mission of educating people to make the best financial choices and, at heart, we’re a group of SEO geeks. That means we’re always learning, discussing new strategies, perfecting old ones, and focusing on creating content that is both extremely valuable and ranks highly so that people can easily find us. It’s not a complicated strategy, but it’s continued to work for us and helped us to reach more people sustainably and cost-effectively. ‍"," ‍The Affiliate Method, my free affiliate marketing course. ‍My blog where I share all of my learnings.

72,flexiple," I am a third-generation entrepreneur. I was born at a time when my grandfather and father had just closed down their clothes manufacturing business and had plans to start a hardware trading business. For the first 22 years of my life, I saw my father and grandfather build a sustainable business in a crowded market by vertically expanding and becoming a hardware manufacturing and trading business. During this time, I was rather unwittingly exposed to life as an entrepreneur as my father never wanted me to follow his path. Yet I learned a lot about negotiations with clients, resolution of co-founder conflicts, and the importance of having an open mind while overhearing his conversations and to a lesser extent having discussions with him. Seven years later, I am now a tech entrepreneur and am building a tech talent network called Flexiple to enable scaling startups to hire & work with the top-1% remote freelance developers and designers. We make it easy for tech startups to hire & work with quality tech talent who are on-boarded over the course of a multi-stage screening process. Over the past couple of years, Flexiple has evolved and we now have 75+ clients and 200+ independent professionals onboard. As the only non-tech co-founder (I have a strong inclination towards user experience design), I own sales and customer relations at Flexiple. ",," The biggest challenge we faced was to build trust in an unorganized market. The efforts to organize have been haphazard, where complex skills are treated as a commodity that can be measured by usual marketplace dynamics such as ratings and reviews. The result is the core interests of all parties involved are compromised. When a company wants to hire a freelance developer or a designer for a particular job, they have to deal with a lot of noise, leading them to engage with sub-par/ not the best talent without having proper structures in place - thereby leading to a not-so-good experience. Increased competition and transparent pricing have not been able to solve this problem for these companies. Our consistent and unwavering focus on quality has helped us differentiate ourselves and build a reputation as a preferred talent partner in the market. We realized very early on that our community members are our core product, who have helped us garner a positive response. We continue to recognize this and have been working diligently to refine our screening process on a continuous basis. Today we are a community of 200+ such members with freelancers from 5 countries with diverse backgrounds and skill sets. They range from hardcore backend developers and the most complete full-stack ninjas to expert UX’ers andamazing illustrators who have worked at top tech-centric companies such as Ola, Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe and Goldman Sachs. Through such a high bar of quality, we are able to work with the best companies in the tech space and help solve their varied talent challenges through our community. On a personal front, wearing different hats and juggling multiple responsibilities has been a challenge I have been able to live up to. Over the past 6 months, apart from managing and delivering on my personal targets of meeting our revenue targets, I have been managing Flexiple’s finances, handling the hiring and onboarding process which saw us grow from a 4-member to a 9-member team within 6 months, and giving inputs whenever necessary on UX design.   The biggest disadvantage in the first year was that none of the three of us were especially good at tangible skills needed to grow and build Flexiple. While Hrishikesh is a core techie and had worked at Adobe and Amazon as a Software Engineer, it had been 2 years since he had last coded. Though, with our motivations aligning and immense efforts, all three of us are hands-on and to certain extent experts in a field, much-needed to grow Flexiple.  I have spent the last year or so, learning the nuances of sales and implementing them across both freelancer and client onboarding. At the same time, Hrishikesh has honed his product management capabilities while also getting back to being hands on with coding. And Karthik has taken to content marketing seamlessly and is our go-to-guy for everything relating to marketing. We still have a lot to learn as we need to improve upon our client conversion rates, our ability to meet product deadlines, and content distribution. However, the learnings we derived from the mistakes we made in the first year have us in good stead to ensure we do not repeat such costly mistakes and don’t let our goals blind us from understanding those of our customers. ",," In the month of July, we launched Remote Tools V2.0 which gave remote-first product makers the freedom to share their products with the remote working community. Within a month of the launch, 100+ remote-first products (we still curate each and every product) have been made live on the platform leading to a total of 250 products for remote workers to choose from for different use-cases. In the next 6 months, we aim to make remote tools a hub for all conversations related to remote working and have taken the first step by launching The Remote Working Show. Where top leaders of remote working startups share their experience of building teams successfully, along with more useful content that would provide value to the remote working audience and encourage discussions. With Remote Tools taking a life of its own, we also intend to publish content on Flexiple’s blogging platform to improve upon our search engine rankings for keywords related to our space. We predict that this focus on creating value for all buyer personas should help us double our revenues by March 2020. However, we also intend to start paying the co-founders market-parity salaries valuing the impact they have had on the business and to future-secure Flexiple and Remote Tools.",," We started working on Flexiple on a part-time basis during our second year of MBA. Given we already had a flavor of the type of freelancers startups are on the lookout for, we decided to keep our focus during this 9 month period onboarding ~50 freelancers while using our automated testing and screening platform. We ran multiple tests on what kind of platform we should build and came to the conclusion that an asynchronous platform giving freelancers the freedom to complete the onboarding at their own pace was the best way to proceed. The product development and design were helmed by the three of us with 2 freelance developers and a designer completing the team. However, our lack of prior product development left us spending 2x the amount we had budgeted for and with a platform which the freelancers were unwilling to use due to the sheer time investment required. This derailed our plans to hit the market hard when we started working full-time from April’17. ‍ Learning quickly from our mistakes, we focused our efforts on having active client requirements so that we could incentivize the freelancers to take the screening process designed by us. Within a couple of weeks, we identified a couple of prospects and began engagements with them. However, due to a paucity of time, we had to give up the asynchronous testing methodology and conducted freelancer screening manually. This model has been working well for us ever since and in the past 2 years, we have identified that the problem we are solving cannot be solved using completely automated customer-facing processes. We identified that we need to build robust internal processes that will enable us to grow Flexiple in a reliable and sustainable manner. Only then can we ensure that our clients and freelancers do not face the usual challenges associated with freelancer hiring. To streamline our internal processes, we are using a host of third-party automation tools and have built a couple of tools of our own as well. One such tool is the Resume App with which we showcase our network to prospective buyers in a concise yet exhaustive manner. All our internal applications have been built while leveraging our freelancer network which is managed fully remotely. ‍ With a robust business model with positive unit economics since day one, we have remained self-funded and have grown to make $80k per month in revenues all done at a shoestring monthly budget of $4,500.",," Prior to joining India’s top-ranked B-school - IIM Ahmedabad where I met my partners and Flexiple’s co-founders - Karthik and Hrishikesh, I had been working for 3 years at HUGE corporations which had thousands of employees across the globe, leading me to have a clearly defined role. However, I was never satisfied with my pace of learning during these three years. While at my first job, I found that the focus was more on just sticking to what has been done since the birth of the company, which led me to look for a switch. At my second job, I figured that learning only hard skills such as data analytics is not as fulfilling as I thought it would be. In this search of learning opportunities, I explored the option of working with Karthik and Hrishikesh for a period of three months. The intention was to learn more about technology and entrepreneurship than what textbooks could teach me. Now, we have been working together on Flexiple for three and a half years now.  During this period, Flexiple has undergone multiple iterations. We started out as an automated platform built for scale which was ultimately not used by anyone. We tried out a pure-play service model and within a couple of weeks landed our first client, which ultimately resulted in us scrapping the platform completely. During this time, we decided to double down our focus on startups who were looking to hire remote full-time freelance talent. Having learned the importance of creating value before looking for a sale, we launched remote.tools which aims to be the platform where remote workers interact with each other. "," The biggest mistake we made when we started out was to cloud our path forward with our own vision of the future rather than the needs of our customers. This mistake led us to build a platform no one wanted and set us back by 6 months and $8,000, which came directly from our savings. Also, I tend to internalise mistakes and don’t let them go. This is a practice I have found to be immensely detrimental in both my personal and professional lives. Thus, I would suggest my former self in 2016 to enjoy the ride while worrying less about the mistakes and their repercussions and to trust my gut. ‍"," To start with, we focused almost exhaustively on cold outreach to both our freelancers and clients. A couple of channels such as LinkedIn, AngelList, worked well for us. However, due to the inherent limit attached to cold outreach, we started focusing on inbounds too while continually optimizing our cold outreach processes.  For inbounds, generating content related to freelancing, remote working worked well for us. During this 6 month process, we identified that the one common characteristic between most of our clients and freelancers was their inclination towards working remotely. Also, 80% of the 150+ conversations we had with this target audience suggested that choosing which tool to use for a particular use-case was their biggest challenge. Managing a remote team ourselves, held us in good stead here as we built a curated repository of 100+ remote tools across 24 categories so as to make this discovery process easier. We decided to launch on Product Hunt and were pleasantly surprised to be voted as the #2 Product of the Day. The best stat was that we landed 4 new clients via remote.tools and made 10 times the money we had invested in the product! Also, on a side note, we were able to launch the product on time and within budget :) The success of this experience showed how marketing should be more about creating value for your users rather than about your own product. Apart from such out of the box marketing initiatives, cold outreach has been reaping rich dividends for us. For the past 6 months, the split of leads from our sales and marketing efforts has been 50:50. ‍"," I am available for a chat over Twitter, LinkedIn, and email. And would love to share notes on self-funding a B2B startup while running a lean remote team."," I am an avid reader and intend to draw learnings from everything I read. Though, for all things related to entrepreneurship, I read threads on Indiehackers and have recently started engaging with them. For my core competency i.e. sales, my go to places have been the SalesHacker blogs and podcasts with Outreach’s blogs also featuring high up on the list. Apart from that, I surround myself with a group of friends who are honest and forthright with me as entrepreneurship can be a lonely journey even though you have co-founders to accompany you on the ride. ‍",,Software & Hardware,,India,"September 26, 2019",Suvansh Bansal,https://www.failory.com/interview/flexiple,"['https://twitter.com/search?q=suvansh+bansal', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/suvansh-bansal/', 'mailto:suvansh@flexiple.com']",success,1,$25k-$100k/mo,"After working on a tech-related internship, Suvansh and his two friends decided to start testing different business ideas.

73,flexiple-2021," I am Karthik, Co-founder and CEO of Flexiple, a network of pre-vetted freelance developers & designers to help top startups & companies find quality tech talent. At Flexiple, my responsibilities include marketing and tech while my co-founders handle the more difficult job of everything freelancer & client operations-related. Before Flexiple, I worked in JPMorgan as an Investment Banker - quite a different job & role as compared to the world of startups I am in now! However, after spending 3 years there, I realized it wasn’t for me and soon started my journey with Flexiple. Now, after investing 4 full years into Flexiple, we have fully bootstrapped it to $2million in annual revenue and have been growing at ~25%+ m-o-m in the past 5 months. Simple business model - our freelance talent set their rates and we take a commission from clients on each project. ",," The biggest obstacle we overcame would be the ability to generate quality inbound traffic and as a result, good leads. None of us (the three co-founders) were active on social media or knew much about marketing. I just made my social accounts last year. Of course, one has to find the relevant channel for them to leverage, but in our case, we realized that just adding value on the mainstream social channels like Twitter and LinkedIn would help us grow our own business too. Also, learning SEO was critical but we started too late. For a couple of years, we wrote articles that were never optimized and therefore didn’t bring us any traffic. So, in all honesty, they were wasted efforts. We, of course, learned from our initial mistakes of building tech before actually needing it or understanding what to build. Since then, we have been gradually infusing it as we scale. Even now, ironically, all our tech is set up on NoCode tools as it gets the job done extremely well. ‍",," It has been a slow burn for us - it took us almost 4 years to get to $1million in annual revenue. However, in just another four months, we are $2million in annualized revenue -  we have been growing at ~25%+ m-o-m in the past 5 months.  Honestly, it isn’t that we have suddenly cracked a hidden code - it is just that our efforts in the past many years are paying dividends now. Of course, we are making fewer mistakes in execution now :). I feel, we have found what I can define as replicable success - so now our focus has shifted to consolidating this while ensuring we build a great team around us. We have laid the initial foundation of a quality team with ~20 of us in the team. Being a fully remote team, we don’t have location constraints but still have other hiring bottlenecks and team engagement techniques to solve for. We haven’t gotten great at that yet and that’s one of my goals in the next 6 months. Furthermore, we are big believers in remote working. Since 2018, we have been building Remote Tools and more recently, Remote Clan. While I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish with these two, we haven’t monetized them yet. I hope to change that in the coming months.",," Honestly, our first two products were absolute failures. We spent $5000 to build each one and ended up throwing each into the bin. In the end, we just used a simple GoogleSheet to make our first $100k in revenue. I have written about it in detail in this thread, but let me explain our mistake briefly here. There are largely two types of tech startups: “Tech-enabled”: where tech just enables you to scale. For e.g. Uber, Airbnb, etc.“Core-tech” where tech is part of your core offering. E.g. Dropbox, Postman, etc. Many startups are just the former but confuse themselves to be the latter.  The consequences of this confusion are that: They invest way too much time building tech to solve future challenges of scale, instead of focusing on building their business and infusing tech when manual efforts have become a bottleneckFurther, trying to build tech before experiencing the real bottlenecks means that you are trying to predict them, which hardly ever works. We made the same mistake. Our customers - freelancers & clients - didn’t care too much about the product we had made. The former wanted quality projects and the latter, great talent. We were just forcing our product on them. When we realized this, we just moved all our work to a simple Google sheet, with our website functioning largely for marketing purposes. All flows thereafter were manual - using emails, manually sending invoices, and so on. This allowed us to focus on actually delivering value to our customers while not being preoccupied about scaling the business from the word go.",," Immediately, after my time at JPMorgan, I wasn’t entirely sure what I wanted to do next. But, when I got through the top MBA university in India, I felt that it might give me the time to explore my next steps. But on joining the MBA school, the noise around job placements pushed me towards starting something of my own. So, I used to carry around an idea book noting down different ideas that I felt I would enjoy working on. In the process, I recognized that B2B was the space where I would like to spend my time building a startup. Of the many ideas, I found Flexiple to be the most interesting because: Most other freelance marketplaces catered to the “gig economy” - where quality is not the focus, rather the volume is. Whereas, Flexiple plays in the “talent economy” where quality is at the core of everything we do and I felt there was still a huge opportunity there.Further, I believed that the future would involve more & more people being focused on building individual brands vs. just being a small cog of a larger monolithic company.Also, tech as a functional vertical was continuing to grow massively in size - all startups have tech as their backbone. Top this with the fact that hiring in tech is just brutally painful. So, we recognized a real problem - building a high-quality tech talent network that can help startups & companies in hiring. The question was largely about whether we could execute and make things happen. "," Being a first-time entrepreneur, there were many mistakes we made, and a few things I realized include: Don’t build for scale before you have earned a single dollar - focus on business before being obsessed with tech.Building in constraints is good - it ensures that you don’t have the luxury to indulge yourself in stupid decisions for long. It aligns you to do the best for your customer as that’s the only REAL way to make money.Start working on SEO, being active on social media and other communities as early as possible.There are easier ways to make money than entrepreneurship. Therefore, starting up for money is not the best idea because you will find it tough to sustain your motivation.Startups test your patience and the ability to do boring & repetitive things over long periods. If you can survive through it, the results are exponential. "," For the initial year, almost all the business we got was through our network. We leveraged LinkedIn to find the right person in the companies we wanted as clients and just hustled our way to get our first 10-20 clients. I wrote about the entire process in detail in this thread.  However, soon we hit a ceiling. We recognized that our target audience was startups in the US, Europe, etc. - tech startups that wanted quality tech talent and could afford them. Given our network was ZERO outside India, we realized we had to work on growing our inbound pipeline.  We found ProductHunt to be quite useful for us. Most startups only launch their primary product on PH, but we also made many “side projects”, which we launched on PH and marketed Flexiple subtly in them. More about it here. However, it wasn’t a very reliable and stable channel. That’s when we invested heavily in SEO and that’s been a real journey. It involved: Build our “Domain authority” by writing many guest postsThen we identified keywords that had high intent. This would involve our competitor alternatives-type keywords on which we wrote focused blogs such as “Toptal alternative” which gave us many client leads.But beyond that, we made a ton of marketing pages targeting low-volume keywords but with very high conversion intent. E.g. A page for “Hire Freelance React Developers” => We would then just replace the word “React” with any other technology and duplicate the pages. Of course, we had to have enough unique content on each page to ensure we weren’t penalized by Google for duplicate content. This SEO strategy laid the foundation for our inbound growth - though it took a lot of mistakes and about a year to pay off in a big way. We have since gotten even better at SEO and have ~100k people visiting our website each month. However, one of the pleasant consequences of ensuring our customers are really happy is that a major source of revenue comes from repeat customers and customer referrals - about ~40%. In the past 4-5 months, both my co-founder and I have become more active on Twitter & LinkedIn which has also become a great channel for new leads.

74,flexy," Hello! My name is Garik, and together with my friends, we have founded a UI/UX design agency, Flexy Global. We aim to become one of the leading UI/UX agencies in the world in the next 3 years. Currently, we have two offices: one in Yerevan, Armenia, and another in Minsk, Belarus.  Flexy Global is out here to help shape companies’ visual identities professionally and aesthetically. We offer two working models. The first is project-based, where we make personalized design audits and propose a lump sum amount for the project. We chose this model because the service is suitable for most rising companies and startups particularly those developing new products or who know exactly what they want. And the second model is a subscription-based service. In this model, we provide the client with a full-time UI/UX designer with a minimum of three months’ commitment. This offer is suitable for companies and startups for a whole array of reasons: They could be working with sprints They’re in the process of ideation and don’t know exactly what they are doingThey’re pivoting or their in house designer cannot keep up with the projects and need helpThe company might simply be in the process of hiring a full-time designer Many scenarios fit our subscription model. All in all, whatever the issue may be, they probably have projects on fire that must be supported and followed through— that is where the Flexy design team kicks in. ‍",," One of the main challenges is hiring the right people. As an agency, we need to hire people who are creative and talented, can also work hard for quite a long period, and can jump from project to project.  I believe we were particularly slow in the hiring process and it is hindering our growth a bit for the moment, but it is important to hire the right people. We were intentionally slow, but in the coming months, we will start hiring worldwide for remote work.  Sometimes I can push at a speed that might be called premature scaling, and in the end, it can cost us a lot of money. Hopefully, Nastya and Davit, my co-founders, will show enough wisdom to counter my actions with common wisdom. This is the reason that I don’t like to start a business alone. ‍",," We will be one year old in a few months but our team is already 15 strong and growing. We have 7 full-time designers, and the rest of the team works in project management, content creation, marketing, and lead generation. We plan to get to 2M ARR within the second year of our operation and expand our offices to a few more locations. Other plans also include opening a design office in Kiev, Ukraine, and having sales offices in the Middle East and the USA.  We are working on an internal tool right now that can make the life of our design and marketing team way easier. If we see that it will be a useful asset we might launch it publicly.  My goal is to make Flexy Global so popular that every startup-er, product manager, and business owner will know about Flexy Global and to be the North Star for other design agencies. ",," We co-founded Flexy Global with three friends my previous business was also co-founded with 3 friends: our Art director and co-founder Nastya, who helped us with our previous product’s design, and my friend Davit, whom I know for the past 30 years. My philosophy is the following— one person is better than 2 but worse than 3. You need to keep enough balance and diversity of ideas within the team. If there are just two team leaders, you can spoil your relationship because there is no mediator. If you are alone, you end up being in your echo chamber, and taking the stress of the startup upon your shoulders is hectic. Four people, on the other hand, is too much, I’ve never tried actually. But, just as states have a balancing mechanism between governing bodies, like in the US, it is a good system to implement to move the startup along. Weeks passed as we started with the first discussions, to actual operation, and our first hire and on June 1st, 2021, we will celebrate our first corporate anniversary.  Our business has two bottlenecks: one consists of leads and incoming projects while the other is screening/hiring good designers. Since our agency kicked off, we are constantly juggling between these two priorities and, as we are growing fast, it is challenging sometimes. To improve the designer hiring process, probably after first settling the backbone of our design team, we will start remote hiring. As for the lead generation, the first channels we appealed to were our friends and family members. For the first few months, our projects came from friends only. They are still arriving after one year. Currently, we are trying 3-4 sales channels and all of them are working well! We haven’t launched publicly and only announced to our friends.",," Before founding Flexy Global, I co-founded a cross-platform photo editor which was available on the web, Android, and iOS. I was the CEO of a diverse 20+ team and enjoyed taking care of the product.  As a product owner, I was constantly searching for creative, ambitious designers and design agencies. What I understood during these five years as an entrepreneur, is that finding a good UI/UX designer or agency is just pure luck. In 2020, our company exited as we sold our photo editor and we decided to start our digital design agency. Finding a UI/UX design agency or freelancer that is talented, can design a great user-friendly product, is responsible, and time-sensitive is practically an insurmountable task. Most of the top agencies have a 6-figure price tag that not many companies and startups can afford. But, we believe that the world can be a better place with more user-friendly products that help people make better decisions for themselves and society. That is why we came up with the name Flexy. We provide each client with a flexible approach to the design, support, and imprint a part of our company’s spark, our ‘DNA,’ onto their product. It is so rewarding to see a client amazed when they discover the cool design concept we prepared for them.  Besides the cross-platform photo editor, I also co-founded the first-ever deep fake mobile app on the market. I had to shut that project down because working on two products at once was rather exhausting at the time. Aside from that, we were having a very long review cycle for the app updates as we couldn’t make improvements fast enough and that is why we decided to focus on one product. What were the lessons I learned by that time? Well, people tend to look for an option B to succeed, but that is defocusing you from the need to put ‘all the eggs into one basket’ to flourish. If you have enough money and human resources then it is not a problem but, if you need to allocate your time on two different initiatives, you can't succeed against competitors who devote themselves full-time. ‍"," The people you choose as co-founders and your first core team members is a really important decision. You are going to work with these people for the next couple of years of your life and have many stressful moments too, so, founding a core team is a fly-or-die scenario. I would never co-found a business with somebody I do not know. It is important to have an abundance mindset and think that you already have everything to reach your business goals. If you think that you are missing things and those missing things are hindering you from reaching your business goals, then that mindset will not take you anywhere."," I simply created an excel list of all my friends and sorted out whom I can notify about us. In the end, my list was 100+ people. My two other co-founders did the same and we sent emails to all. So far, we have had 5 projects from our friends and simultaneously built our Dribbble portfolio and clutch profiles. After ending each project we made sure to showcase them both on clutch and Dribbble, which became a constant lead generation channel for us.  I tried Facebook and Instagram ads without much success. Right now, we are trying cold outreach both through cold emails and Linkedin. So far, the results are quite positive! We already had 2 projects in the second week after our launch and are growing ever since then. Currently, we can handle up to 5 projects simultaneously and support some old clients with small tasks. To grow our revenue we focused on expanding our visibility and building close relationships with new and existing clients. ‍", Feel free to check out our work on Dribbble and our website.," One of the tools we use specifically for CRM is Monday.com, mainly for tracking our leads.

75,flux," Hi! I am the founder and CTO of Flux, which was a modular multi-messaging client. I studied a bit of physics and philosophy before, but I am mainly a self-taught full stack developer. Right now, I am in the middle of open sourcing all software that we built and using it as a basis for consulting and freelancing for companies that need a messaging platform. I am really grateful to all our investors that allowed me to do this and I am confident that somehow something new and bigger will evolve out of this unique situation. ‍"," A combination of many issues, probably any one of them would have been enough for a failure, so I am still somewhat proud of what we achieved. This is my overview in no specific order: ‍ Looking for investment too early/ at all: The product we tried to build was just not that interesting to investors, I see why with my knowledge now, but at the time we thought it was just about not trying hard enough. In retrospect, it was stupid to look for bigger investors at all, at least in Berlin. Had we just tried to sell consulting, services and custom solutions and building the product along the way instead of the wasted VC time we would have gotten much further. The wrong impression I had was based on reading mainly US-based blogs as well as listening too much to people from the Berlin startup world that gave advice on how they thought or wished things would be instead of the actual experience of success in the current world. ‍ Bad cofounder fit: Me and my business cofounder were extremely opposite characters and at times there was a great synergy but more and more often this lead to a lot of friction. Also, co-founders should probably know each other for more than a year before, but we just met for the venture. Lastly, I highly overestimated the available funding in Berlin for this extremely early stage and kind of product and so assumed that a business person who is good with people had more to do than was the case. I naively thought he could just go and sell a prototype to a VC and then build up the office and hire the people as well as do finance and contracts when in reality all we needed was people to work on the product until we could show traction. ‍ Over-engineering: I am responsible for over-engineering a few aspects of flux. I changed a lot since then, to not make the same mistakes again. But reading about extreme programming and MVP is one thing but I don’t think I was able to really “feel” what it means without having gone through the situation. The following are the main over-engineering mistakes:      1. Overestimating the convergence/ availability of REST APIs: I thought all companies will publish a REST API with converging concepts for paging, endpoint structure, authentication, references and pretty open usage restrictions. Therefore, we built a DSL for connecting and consuming REST endpoints. In Erlang. We could just have built the first connectors manually and then at a much later stage still develop a DSL and automate the process if it would have made sense then. This was also a big problem because investors asked us about ‘secret sauce’ all the time, so the technology for connector building seemed really important to us. When in reality the problem was we wanted to impress investors in the first place.      2. Over/Under engineering Client Model: I did not know about observables and Rx, maybe they did not even exist then, I’m not sure. The point is the same however: the view model for flux became very complex and depended on multiple asynchronous processes and a locking system to generate it consistently grew hard to manage. Today I would not have half the headaches from then because of RxJS or similar tools.      3. Too early adoption of micro-services with wrong service boundaries: I tried to use whatever developer resources I could get my hands on and allowed them to use languages they thought were great as long as I also found them interesting and fitting. This lead to a mixture of Erlang, Go, Ruby and JavaScript that became extremely hard to support especially as developers with different knowledge joined and left. In retrospect, I should just have completely bought into the node.js wave, but at the time node.js was nowhere near the solid platform it is today and as we over-estimated the short-term funding and growth possibilities: we just thought that investing in reliable and scalable services would pay of sooner than it would have and that the language zoo would be no problem as the team grew bigger.      4. Technical idealism at the wrong place: I am and always was a CouchDB fanboy. But at the time the concept of CouchApp was also on the horizon and I was so much into the vision of distributed, independent and self-contained web applications, that I tried to make the whole architecture work in such a future. This future never happened and I could have spent a lot of the time working on actual product features with immediate impact. ‍ Bad luck on timing: When we started, Twitter’s API was still hugely unregulated and Facebook and Google had an XMPP API for messaging and saw it mainly as a relatively unimportant extra for their main products. But then messaging was the new big thing and they changed to a more closed and even more walled garden strategy. This was before business messaging accounts were on their focus, so we did not have the old API but the new APIs (e.g. Facebooks pages messaging) were not available yet. Needless to say, this was a small disaster for a startup with very limited resources. Luckily, we supported emails as a channel from day one so we could focus on email use cases. Maybe email support would have been on the over-engineering list too, if it did not allow us to build new iterations in this difficult time. Good email support is a huge pain to build, but once you have it, it’s so powerful, that I do not regret a single sleepless night building it. ‍ Focusing on consumers instead of businesses for too long: Building a product for consumers instead of businesses requires a very different mindset. After it became clear consumers and prosumers would not be a big enough market it took us too long to start focusing on businesses, mainly due to the different cultures. ‍ What finally killed us: Contract Negotiations with a big German business: When we finally managed to make the switch we were already very low on runtime. It was clear we could just try this time. One of our investors gave us one of their lawyers but the contracts were just an endless rabbit hole. When we finally found a somewhat acceptable basis, the big company had a restructuring and the contact person changed, we had zero runtime left and instead of being able to start the cooperation we had a new contract version in the mail that gave them complete exclusivity on so much of the project that we could never have used the software with a different client. That was the end.  ",,,,, We did never enter a growth phase and failed already in private beta. But we had a few thousands of users on the waiting list. We mainly got them through giving talks and public pitches as well as exposure from our accelerator StartupBootcampBerlin.,," The main idea is quite old and evolved out of discussions with friends at university. The main pain point we had at that time was that Facebook just entered the German market and we experienced firsthand what it means to have all your messages and friends stuck in the data silo of studiVZ, which was the German copycat that was used before Facebook. The basis of all product iterations was always that we tried to build something that lets you own your data but still take part in mainstream social media with normal non-nerdy friends. First prototypes were before diaspora but similar federated social networks. We quickly learned that support for all data types (images, events etc.) was too much, so we focused on the most important one: messages. The second learning that led to the product idea was that replacing the status quo was impossible so we focused on building a professional messaging product that used existing messaging channels like Facebook and email. ‍"," In addition to all the learnings from mistakes I already talked about: I learned a lot about my weaknesses and people. Lastly, I hugely improved as a developer, architect, and CTO. This personal development is hard for me to put into words, it’s just too much, and it is hard to tell what is a result of growing up and what is directly connected to the startup experiences. Just so much: I am not naturally good at implanting my vision into other people and also, I am not good at letting go and accepting half-baked solutions with long-term risks when there is not enough time.    I don’t want to give advice the world is full of un- or semi-successful entrepreneurs happily giving advice to anyone and even those who were successful are full of survivorship bias and most advice is bullshit anyways. If someone has a question I am always happy to answer as honest as I possibly can.  ",," I am not publishing much at the moment, but if there is any news, I will most likely post it on Twitter and GitHub."," I think books about entrepreneurship or technology are overrated. I read abstracts about all important concepts and go into slightly more depth for things I find relevant or interesting, but reading or writing a whole book instead of “doing” just feels fundamentally wrong. ‍"," We raised a small angel round of ~ 70K € and burned through ~ 70K € of private savings for living costs for me and my co-founder. After giving up, just keeping alive the company entity and getting everything to a happy ending cost me another 15K.

76,formatically," My name is Duncan Hamra and I’m currently working on Memberstack. We're making it easier to add user accounts and payments to any website. I'm the co-founder, and I do most of the design work there. I was lucky enough to meet my best friend and my current co-founder in preschool. We've been best friends for a really long time. We're both 25, and we've known each other for pretty much all of our lives. We started our first company together in high school, where we hired some friends, knocked on some neighbor's doors, and started mowing lawns. We ran that business for three years before we managed to sell it to somebody. We restarted it three times. There were two failed versions before we got to the version that sold and we didn't sell it for a ton of money. We sold the equipment and a contact list of 100 people. We used some of that money from selling the business to start building a website called Formatically. ‍"," The funny thing is, I don't think we ever did. We were both very optimistic. We were determined to get this going and working. We only stopped working on it because we had the idea for MemberStack. We both did a pitch competition where we pitched an entirely different idea because we knew Formatically wouldn't win. We wanted to get the money for Formatically. We won second place and took that money. We ended up getting an office space as part of the winnings. We were sitting in the office space working on Formatically and both of us had the idea for MemberStack. We agreed to not give up on it but to try the new idea for a couple of weeks and see what happened. In the first three days, we managed to get a client. We had pretended to be an agency. Everyone's pretending so we said we were an agency and managed to get a client in the first week. We decided to pursue it and to come back to Formatically eventually. We've been saying that ever since. It still exists. The optimistic part of me still wants to keep it alive so others can do something with it. I don't know if we’re really stubborn, but I'm glad we found MemberStack. "," The first one was working with an external provider. Because we had somebody else building it for us, we had to learn through that person. We didn't know what we were doing. It was very hard to iterate through those versions. We'd create a version, realize it was terrible. And then we will need to spend another $2,000 to completely rebuild the product. We were not even sure if this new version was going to work. We discovered paper prototyping and prototyping tools. I started getting into that. Another big challenge was monetization. We were trying to figure out what our product offered that people would be willing to pay for. ‍",,,," We first got into WordPress. We were listening to a podcast called the Smart Passive Income and the recommended stack was Bluehost, WordPress, and a virtual assistant. If you needed to build something more complicated, you just hired a virtual assistant or you hired someone on Upwork to build that thing for you. We had not heard anything about any no-code tools, it wasn't being tossed around. We hired a college student in New York. He started with a WordPress app and then built a JavaScript and PHP application. It was pixel perfect from a PowerPoint file that Tyler and I made, which was all boxes and text. It was beautiful. ‍"," We did a couple of things. One was talking to friends. That was how we started. We then did some cold email outreach. We wrote some comments around the web when people were complaining about different citation tools and formatting tools. The thing that got us most of our traffic was writing articles. We wrote how-to articles where we would first talk about how to format papers. We ended up getting some SEO from that and reaching 260,000 visitors in 6 years. ‍"," We had the idea while we were in high school. We were making lists of problems we thought would be interesting to solve. The advice we had heard was to find a problem you have yourself, and then figure out how to solve that. We were sitting in English class one day and our teacher mentioned that somebody needed to make it easier to automatically format papers. We had a little bit of money and we learned about Upwork and Fiverr. Building a website couldn't be that hard. We hired someone to do that. It was 2013 and we spent the next five years building different versions of that website, learning how to write code, learning how to design, learning how to hire people only to find out at the end that you have to have an idea that you can relate to and that you can solve well, but also has to be able to make money. It was incredibly valuable, and I have no regrets. We had a blast. ‍"," We learned so much along the way. If there was some way we could accelerate that learning, it would be worthwhile. But just knowing where we were at, and what we knew at the time and the information we had, I have no regrets. Design is very important, but having something that looks good is at least half the battle. But at the same time, perfection is the enemy. If you're waiting to launch because something needs to be perfect, then you're moving way too slowly. “It's also really powerful if you're building a web app to be able to build web apps.” When I think about starting a business, I evaluate it from several perspectives that I didn't before. I use the framework from 80,000 hours, which isn't a business site, but I like the way they think. When you go to tackle a problem, look at it in three dimensions. How many people have this problem? How important is this problem to them individually? How easy is this to solve? You have to ask yourself how easy it is to solve with the things you have now. How much easier would it be to solve if I utilized all my resources? The vision we had for Formatically required resources that Tyler and I didn't have, we had to learn them. Because we were young, we were in a place in our lives where it was normal for us to recognize we needed resources, then go to school, or go get jobs to learn those things. We were missing the ability to design and write code. So let's go learn to do that. I think that was really valuable. I'm not confident we did in the most effective way though. Thanks to no-code tools and coding bootcamps, design schools, companies like Webflow, it makes designing and building quite a bit easier. I say there are definitely more effective ways to get there than we did. ‍  Get feedback on everything you're doing. The idea, the prototypes, the drawings, the sketch files. “Get feedback. Don't be afraid to reach out to people.” One place to start is other people who are starting businesses, but the best people you can talk to are your actual customers. If you struggle to find real customers to talk to, that's a very uncomfortable realization, but it's a helpful realization that the thing you're solving doesn't have many people who need it, or you're not in a good position yet to be able to solve, talk to and interact with those people. The people I've seen who've been the most successful are the ones who have a clear path. They have a clearer understanding of what the problem is and a clear path to the people who are feeling that problem. If you have those two things, then you just need to solve the problem. If you don't, then you need a marketing background. You need to have a lot of conversations with those people. ‍",, You can find me on Twitter.," Y Combinator content.

What I do know is that we made around $5,000 when we started monetizing it from an essay formatting service. In total, we spent around $10,000. We also had ads for a little while, and we made around $200-$300. Nothing crazy, but it felt like a lot at the time. It was very slow and steady.

77,freshconnect," My name is Tarun Gupta and I'm 26 years old. I did my schooling in a small town near Sirsa, Haryana but I'm currently based out of Bangalore, a metropolitan city in Karnataka, India. Nowadays, I'm heading supply chain ops at Evenflow Brands, which buys & builds e-commerce first brands.  Freshconnect was an online B2B marketplace for fresh agricultural produce like fruits & vegetables. I was co-founder & COO and was responsible for operations, business development & finance verticals majorly. Anyway, you practically need to keep an eye on all areas of an early-stage startup as a founder.  We had a very simple business model where we used to charge a margin on top of cost price for the products & delivery charge for the logistics services to our customers. ‍"," Check out my reflections on this question here. At a personal level, inexperience was our disadvantage. I & my co-founder were recent graduates from the same college and I know that a lot of founders start right out of college but that should be balanced by a mentor or advisor who helps you to understand the macro view of things. As first-time entrepreneurs, we made many mistakes in hiring, business model, and GTM strategy, but the biggest mistake was not being nimble. We got stuck with the initial team and business model for long enough for us to not be able to come out of it successfully.   There was not a single reason for our failure. We made bad hiring decisions initially as well as didn’t fire bad elements at the right time, set up wrong expectations from each other (as co-founders), did not work much on financial planning, took the initial interest of investors for granted which didn’t lead into investment, among other reasons. We started raising outside capital very late in the journey. We had real-time feedback with customers but not with investors which, in my opinion, is equally important and helps you to have a macro view of the model along with a micro view of problems that you are trying to solve. A lot of founders think that media or marketing is just to reach customers, but it's super important to reach to investors as well. No investors had heard about us even though we had achieved better metrics than others in the ecosystem. This is another mistake that did cost us our company.  We also lacked focus initially and spread ourselves too thin as per our limited resources. This led to us achieving inappropriate metrics which made it hard for us to raise external funds which were necessary for our business model.  I remember that we had a healthy revenue growth rate month on month but didn’t have the financial backup to sustain it for long and we were desperate for capital. We already had initial interest from 2 angel investors and we were relying on this capital to survive. Both deals fell through within a week due to the investor’s reasons. This seemed like the end of it but I was still optimistic and tried to curtail expenses and increase our efforts on fundraising so that we could survive.  My co-founder had a mental breakdown and we all suggested that he took a break for some time. It was tough for me to manage  this situation but this was the right thing to do. He went home and started getting better. But then I got a call from him after a few weeks telling me he couldn't take it anymore and wanted to quit. I think this was a mental breakpoint for everyone. Slowly, other team members started to quit too. I tried to get an M&A deal for a month but without any success. Eventually, my co-founder came back and helped me to get an acqui-hire deal with another large company. The rest of our team joined the other company along with the transfer of our whole business. FreshConnect went on as it was and even grew more than 6x in the acquirer company. ‍",,,,," One month before I left the job (July 2018):  Amit and I had different ideas for the startup. While I was trying to connect farmers to markets, he was trying to create an online marketplace for businesses & farmers alike. But there were a lot of similarities so we decided to brainstorm the ideas together and come up with a common framework to work these ideas out. At that time, I came across the book Disciplined Entrepreneurship by Bill Aulet, a professor at MIT Sloan. He had created 24 steps to build a successful startup. We used this framwork to define our target segments and figure out the most pressing problem these segments had. We decided that we wanted to solve problems for retailers in the procurement of fresh produce. For that, we needed to learn what their problems were  by talking to them.  Besides this, Amit had already hired a fresh graduate who was a software developer to help him build the tech product. After I left the Job (Aug 2018):  We drafted a list of questions inspired by the book and started going to retail stores in nearby areas trying to understand their current purchasing process and problems they were encountering. Also on the side, Amit & the hired developer started working on the tech product as basic wireframes, etc. were already in place from the work that Amit had done before FreshConnect. Amit also convinced 2 experienced software engineers to come on board part-time to build the backend & frontend. Moreover, we brought 1 more team member who was from our college and a junior of Amit in order to handle operations along with me.  Part of pre-accelerator (Sept 2018): Until this point we were on our own and being first-time entrepreneurs, trying different things. I started applying to accelerators and similar programs to be part of the ecosystem as well as to get mentorship. We applied to an equity-free pre-accelerator called Startup Launchpad and got selected. The commitment was a few hours on the weekend and they helped us with doing customer interviews and with our GTM strategy. With their help, we launched the same month with 1 customer, to whom we delivered the products on our bikes. We hadn't built any tech yet and we were still heavily using WhatsApp for customer communication and GDocs for all our internal planning.  Tech Product Launch (Mar 2019)  We did a lot of experiments with Whatsapp & other free tools to understand customer behavior initially before launching our product. We initially planned to launch the tech product in Dec 2018 but it got delayed by 3-4 months because of the challenges around DevOps or expectation mismatch from our teammates who were working part-time. Finally, in Mar 2019, we launched a web application where users could log in using their phone number and OTP, see all the categories of products in a structured format and add to cart. However, there was no checkout system. Orders were finished through Whatsapp. We wanted to launch faster and Amit came up with this hack. We initially used Firebase for beta but we then shifted to AWS (free account for 1 year with limited options) as our server. There was another challenge that we faced which was related to our target audience: retailers were not tech-savvy and we needed to push them to order through the app. I think this push is needed to change existing user behavior. While well-capitalized players do it through giving deep discounts, we did it manually. Burning Money (Oct 2019) We grew 10-15% month on month and till this point we were completely bootstrapped, unable to raise outside capital but at the same time, we were losing money m/m due to operations cost & defaults in credits by customers. In October 2019, I did some calculations and realized that we only had one month of runway left with our existing resources. It was a wake-up call for everyone. We immediately took a small loan of Rs. 3Lacs on the company. However, it was still a small amount for the long term we needed to raise equity capital. The motivation of the team start going down as we started losing our monthly growth. My co-founder took a break in Nov 2019 and went to his hometown. During that time, I kept trying to keep the boat afloat as much as possible and looking for ways to raise money in desperation. "," We didn’t do any paid marketing in our journey of FreshConnect as we wanted to grow organically. We were not present on any social media platform. We onboarded our customers through offline sales and used WhatsApp for communicating offers. I think customers were very responsive on WhatsApp as more than 390M users use it in India. Offline sales worked well as it allowed us to understand the problem of the customer and accordingly position our solution, which resulted in better sales."," I hail from a lower-middle-class family in a small town but I have always been a curious and aspirational person since my childhood. In our society, if you are an above-average student you either go for engineering or medical for your undergraduate studies. I chose engineering as I liked maths and went on to prepare for JEE (Entrance examination for getting into prestigious engineering colleges IITs). After failing once and in my final attempt, I got into IIT Delhi (top 3 engineering college of India). College was a lot of fun, I got to explore my identity after seeing people from diverse backgrounds. Also, I got to learn about entrepreneurship for the first time while doing my first internship for a startup that was operating from the dorm room of my college in 2013. After that, I tried to start my own company and after trying multiple ideas, when nothing evolved into something tangible and with a lot of pressure from family, I was forced to take up a supply chain consulting job through campus placements.  Even after joining the job, I used to try to be updated on what was happening in the startup ecosystem and tried to brainstorm ideas on weekends. A few months later, I was exposed to the conditions of the Indian farmers when I saw hunger strikes and farmer rallies happening all over the country. Looking at this, I realized that it was the inefficiency and unfair practices involved in this sector that lead to low farmer incomes. I started researching this field with the idea of connecting farmers directly to markets. After a few months of working part-time on this project, I finally decided to take this up full-time by quitting my job. The initial idea was called FarmConnect and consisted on connecting farmers to markets. I was working on this with a high school student who was passionate about entrepreneurship too. But later on, it didn’t work out and I was left with no job and no co-founder.  But I kept working on the idea and started talking to people in my network who were working on solving similar problems. One of my seniors from IIT Delhi connected me to Amit Kashyap, who was also my senior at college. After graduating from IIT Delhi in Electrical Engineering, Amit started his career with Honeywell Aerospace as a Senior Engineer in 2015. As he worked on system engineering techniques for Aircraft Maintenance IT Solutions, Amit always wanted to work for society and create an impact. This led him to the conditions of Indian Agricultural Producers and he grew passionate about this cause. On gaining a fair understanding of the inefficiency in this sector, he started working on bringing markets closer to the producers. Around the same time I got in touch with him and after a few discussions and debates in the initial stage, I and Amit decided to go ahead with the idea of FreshConnect. Prior to FreshConnect, while in college, there was an important moment in my entrepreneurship journey. In my second year, a guy with a diary in his hand knocked on my door. He explained to me that he had a business opportunity that didn't require investing a lot of money or resources. It was a multilevel marketing business, where you earned passive income by growing your network just like the Amway model. In my desperation to do something, I thought this was a sign and I took the opportunity by spending INR15000 of my college scholarship on that. This guy later convinced me to spend INR25000 more, so as to be able to get success faster. It was all logical for me at that point, so I did invest all my scholarship amount of that semester. Unlike other MLM companies, they were giving products worth the same amount I was investing, but the problem is that no one needed them. On top of that, I flunked my studies to completely focus on my business and justified it by looking at examples like Bill Gates who dropped out of college to start their business. I performed very poorly that semester, lost my scholarship money and soured a lot of relationships with my friends by selling this opportunity to them. This also hurt my mental health as I went into mild depression (without knowing it). I was ashamed of myself because of this failure and I didn’t tell my parents about this until everything fell apart.  But this experience taught me a lot of life lessons:  It's not worth fulfilling your ambitions at the cost of precious relationships. That I am good at sales. I did great in selling memberships as the first time selling something. I used to show them the big picture after trying to understand their motivations in life then. I should not put all the eggs in one basket especially in the case of startups which are very risky endeavors. There should be a fine balance of emotion & rationalism while making these decisions."," Find the right co-founder (preferably someone you know) and have as many hard conversations as possible before committing to starting up. Set the right expectations from day one.Focus on making one thing successful rather than spreading yourself too thin. Think hard on your finances as that is the fuel that keeps a startup going. Work on raising capital early if needed. Hiring decisions are the most costly one, so take time and effort to make the right initial hires. Set right expectations and sell them the bigger vision. At the initial stages, I wish we should have spent more time on hiring, fundraising & talking to users rather than increasing our sales and revenue.

78,friday," Hey everyone! I’m Luke, the founder of Friday. We’ve built software to help you stay connected at work, no matter where your team is based. After 6+ years working remotely for a few different companies (in a variety of roles), I’m productizing my most important learnings and making it easier to implement what the best teams and companies do (albeit manually). The reality is that communicating with people who are in different locations isn’t easy, but it doesn’t need to be so difficult. We’ve built software to help you create better communication processes at work to help improve the flow of information and keep everyone connected and on the same page. In many ways, Friday approaches communication at work like an engineer might think about architecting a codebase. It looks something like this: I’m 28 years old and I live here in the beautiful city of Portland, Maine with my wife, 17-month-old son, and two dogs. Outside of work, I like reading and being a dad. ",," I don’t want to dramatize my experience as I know there are many others who probably have gone through a lot to grow their business.  My biggest challenge was around this time last year. My newborn son was colic (i.e. - he would always cry for no obvious reason) and I was trying to balance my full-time day job alongside building Friday and keeping customers happy. Additionally, we were trying to sell our house and move to a new location. To make matters worse, I was renovating the new house on my own (flooring, trim, etc). It was one of the most stressful times of my life, but it taught me to be patient. With that being said, I’m so thankful that the season is done. It was brutal.   My biggest mistake was in the early days of product development. We had just closed our biggest customer and had just spent a bunch of time building out new features. Long story short, we onboarded them and it was a disaster. Notification emails were sent to the wrong customer, so people would see a “Bob completed an update” email, whereas Bob worked for a different company. That was massively embarrassing and in many ways a breach of customer trust. It was one line of code fix. If I had taken the time to QA a bit more, it’s possible we could have caught the issue. I really don’t like letting our customers down. I try to take this as seriously as possible and not take their trust for granted. My biggest mistakes are things I should have caught with a bit more time/effort/attention. ",," I have a few goals. I’d like Friday to be a must-have tool for distributed teams and to make work better for as many people as possible. I lived in a small town of 900 people, so I’d like to do everything I can to provide interesting work opportunities to people, regardless of where they live. You shouldn’t need to live in a big city to find meaningful work, especially if you have a skill. Secondly, I’d like business to be a vehicle for doing good for all stakeholders (investors, customers, etc). I think business provides an amazing vehicle to help others and make the world a better place. Many business owners don’t take advantage of this opportunity but I’d like to do things differently. It would make my day to be known as a great place to work, who does good things in the community.  My personal goal is to be able to provide for my family in a way where we don’t have to worry about finances all the time. I’d like to be in a position where I can help others who are less fortunate, both from a time and financial perspective. Finally, I’d like to buy a nice piece of land someday too. Growing up, I loved playing in the woods. I’d like to get back out there!",," Originally, I hired a software engineer in Europe to help me build out the first version of the product. I was paying for everything out of pocket, so I was trying to keep costs low for the MVP. This took 2-3 months and then I started trying to convince my friends to start using the product with their teams. A few decided to help and gave me some great feedback. Within a few months, I had my first paying customer, which felt great and validated (in my mind) that this was valuable enough to pay for. I started off charging $5/month per person. The pricing certainly wasn’t ideal, but it was close enough that it worked for the majority of our customers. Over the next several months, we continued to improve the product (keep in mind, the product itself looked terrible as you can see in the images below), but people found enough value to pay for, which was all that mattered for me. Additionally, they recommended it to other leaders inside their company, so we were able to grow the accounts over time.  I didn’t formally “launch” the product publicly until a few weeks ago because I was embarrassed about it (a mistake in hindsight). We finally launched on ProductHunt a few days ago. Instead, I relied on content marketing and various hacked together marketing ideas to generate enough interest to get people to signup. If anyone signed up for a free trial, I’d instantly reach out (oftentimes manually) pretty much-begging people for feedback. In many ways, this was like pushing a snowball up a hill. You expend a ton of energy to move the snowball, but at least you are making some forward motion! If you are an entrepreneur, do everything you can to get one people’s radar (within reason). Most “big bang” launches don’t go as well as you want anyways. Overall, Friday has been a journey of constant iteration, frustration, and excitement. But I think that’s the same story for any company. It takes time to figure things out. There’s always something that needs to be improved. There’s always a fire to fight. For me, that’s what makes running a company exciting. There’s a new challenge every day that needs to be solved. ",," I started thinking about the idea behind Friday in 2013. At the time, I had just left a company because I didn’t have a great relationship with my manager. I was struggling at work, but didn’t feel comfortable bringing this up because he didn’t ask, “how are things going?” The best managers I had in the past had regular 1-1s and would ask questions on a regular basis. After this experience, I thought there was a way one could build software to help managers improve the communication and feedback loop between employees/leaders. Unlike a busy manager, a computer would never forget to ask questions as long as it was programmed correctly. I sat on the idea for a couple of years, pitching the idea to friends and executives. People seemed to like the idea, but I didn’t have a working product at the time so I wasn’t able to determine if this was a good/bad idea. Finally, in late 2015 I decided that it was time to stop thinking about the idea and time to start building something. I guess they call this making the transition from a wantrepreneur to an entrepreneur :) Over time, the idea has adapted. I tried selling the product as a “manager sidekiq” and experienced some success with it (growing to $10k/mo as a side project), but I constantly felt like I was missing out on something much better. Around this time last year, I was reflecting on a variety of data points from customers, advisors, and my own personal experience and came to the conclusion that we could create a customizable tool to run any regular communication event/update at work. Instead of being a tool to improve the employee <-> manager relationship, this could be a tool to help you create communication habits at work. Things clicked for me and I became excited about the idea. At the time, this was still a night/weekend project for me, but I knew that I needed to make the jump and go full-time on this. The way I look at the market is that there’s plenty of tools that improve the efficiency of workplace communication. Slack makes it easy to chat with coworkers. Zoom makes it easier to have video calls. But there’s a need to help you create a better communication process. It’s not enough to have the tools. You need to think about your process as well. It’s like having plumbing in your house, but not having pumps to regulate the flow of water. This pivot was risky, but I’m so glad we did it. The best part is that we were able to bring over many existing customers to this new product and they are using the product more than they have in the past. That feels really good. It validates our shift in direction."," I would focus all my energy on finding a product hook and building around a narrow use case to start. It’s so easy to expand and add features with the hope of finding something that works when in reality, simple solutions work. This allows you to get the most bang for your buck when doing product development. I might also look at markets that are not “hot.” The hotter the market, the more competition. You may like the competition, but your probability of success may be lower. I’d also make sure that the product solves a personal pain point. There was a time at Friday when I was building for a different target market and it was brutal. I didn’t enjoy it. It’s so much easier to get excited about a product that you personally find value in. That’s really it. As a look back on the journey, there’s a very real possibility that I wouldn’t be here now if it wasn’t for the winding journey along the way. "," I’ve tried all kinds of things, including: Leaving comments on Harvard Business Review Articles on related topicsWriting content/guides on popular topics like 1-1 meetings.Liking and following people on Twitter based on what they were talking about Distribution is one of the most difficult things you need to think about when growing your company. What insight or advantage do you have that your competitors don’t? Many marketing channels can be competed away (like paid advertising), so ideally, you should find something that gets easier as you grow. I consistently find that the best use of my time is to talk to existing customers and improve the product so it’s more of a must-have. If I do that, people will tell their friends about it. My best piece of advice for marketing is to ask your customers/prospects a very basic question - “what resources do you visit if you’d like to learn more about [insert topic here]?  I think of customer acquisition like fishing. You need to go where the fish are. How do you know where the fish are? You ask them where they like to hang out :) We tried many experiments that failed as well. For example, at one point I paid for advertising and it was a complete waste of money. If you have even a trickle of people signing up on a regular basis, your time is best spent learning how to improve the product for those users. If you wow them, they will tell their friends. ‍", There are a few ways to connect with me if you’d like to chat more: TwitterPersonal websiteFriday website," For startups, I would strongly recommend reading or watching anything by David Sacks, Peter Thiel (like Zero to One), Keith Rabios, or Paul Graham. I would avoid most advice unless the person has an established track record of success. You should even take what I say here with a grain of salt. Outside of startups, I’ve found a lot of value in reading older books. It’s much easier to pick up on timeless principles vs. the trends that may die out over time. Specifically: My life in advertising/scientific advertising (Claude Hopkins)22 immutable laws of marketing (Al Ries & Jack Trout)High Output Management (Andy Grove) My most important piece of advice is that entrepreneurship is about doing. You can read all the books in the world, but at some point, you need to do something. Focus on improving the rate of your learning, stay close to customers, and ask lots of questions. They will show you the way...or at least help you make constant progress :) ‍",,Software & Hardware,,United States,"April 22, 2020",Luke Thomas,https://www.failory.com/interview/friday,"['http://twitter.com/@lukethomas14', 'http://www.lukethomas.com', 'http://www.friday.app']",success,1,$10k-$25k/mo,"Luke had an idea: a tool that would help managers communicate with employees.

79,frontend-mentor," Hello! I’m Matt Studdert, and I live in London, UK. I’m the founder of Frontend Mentor, a platform that helps people improve their front-end coding skills by building real projects. Instead of tutorials, we provide our community with professionally designed projects to build. These challenges help our members gain real experience in creating websites and web apps in a realistic workflow. Frontend Mentor has a freemium business model where people can choose between taking our free challenges or upgrading to our PRO subscription. Our free challenges are typically smaller projects and come with JPG images of the designs. Our PRO subscription gives our members who are more serious about professional development access to the original design file for the free challenges, our premium challenges, plus a few extra features on the platform.  Our premium challenges are as close to real professional projects as possible. They’re typically multi-page websites or web apps. The design file is included in the project. They have mobile, tablet, and desktop layout designs and a design system for colors, common components, etc. These make incredible showstopper portfolio pieces to help our members get interviews and find their dream job. ‍",," The biggest obstacle we’ve had to overcome is time and resources (which is much the same for anyone starting!). It was only January this year that I went full-time on Frontend Mentor, and Mike only came on full-time this month. So we’ve been juggling building Frontend Mentor with our paid work for a couple of years! I had been working as a contractor, so I had more available hours to work on it. Whereas Mike has always been full-time elsewhere, so he could only manage the odd evening and weekend. This has meant we’ve both needed to be patient, but it’s also helped us get good at prioritizing the right work because of our lack of available time. Over time, the community has continued to grow, and it has picked up more and more pace as each month has gone by. In May, we surpassed 150,000 registered members on the site! Another obstacle we’re starting to see is copycat sites. Some of whom have copied our model and wording to a tee. It’s frustrating, but there’s plenty of room for other players in the space, and I’m all for competition and offering alternatives to the development community.  For anyone facing copycats or competitors launching, I’d recommend reading The Innovation Stack by Jim McKelvey. It offers a brilliant reminder that the small decisions you make through research, feedback, and gut instinct compound to create something truly unique. Others may try to copy, but as long as you’re clear on your vision, it will be hard to stop you. We’ve also turned down investment in favor of trying to build the company sustainably. We’ll see in time whether or not that’s a mistake! ",," Frontend Mentor is on a great path at the moment. Revenue has grown consistently month-over-month since we launched our subscription in August last year. Revenue last month was just over $17K, which now means Mike has also come on board full-time (I made the jump in January when we were at $6K). With our expenses, contractors, and salaries, we’re break-even at this point, but hopefully, revenue will stay on the same trajectory, and we can grow further! We’re very clear on our goals for Frontend Mentor. We want to run the company as a calm, sustainable business that allows for a well-rounded, comfortable lifestyle for anyone who works within it. We are entirely opposed to the hustle culture message. We believe firmly that through processes, scalable solutions, and a clear vision, we can grow without sacrificing the team’s physical and mental health. We’re looking at companies like Gumroad and Buffer as models of the type of business we’d like to run. We want to build a house that we want to live in! Our next move on the business side will be to find ways to help connect companies with our incredible community of talented developers. We have an abundance of skilled developers from all over the world in our community, many of whom are looking for jobs.  This is what I think will unlock the full potential of the platform. People’s Frontend Mentor profiles will become the perfect place for people to show off their skills building projects and display their knowledge by giving feedback on other people’s solutions. My goal is for a developer’s Frontend Mentor profile to be just as important as their GitHub or Stack Overflow profile when looking for work. ",," I started Frontend Mentor as a free offering. I was focused more on helping developers and solving their core needs. I knew there was a chance it could turn into a business in the future, but I didn’t want to rush a business model. At this point, I had quit my full-time job but had increased my hours at GA, so I was earning enough money to keep me afloat. After the lightbulb moment of creating projects for front-end developers, I spent another day getting a project up on the site. I found a Sketch design on a Sketch resources website, emailing the designer to get permission to use their design in return for a link to their portfolio site. Another LinkedIn article, some Slack messages to my classes, and some social media posts later, I was ready to test my idea! Sure enough, people started downloading the project, completing the challenge, sharing their solutions, and asking for feedback. This was perfect! After talking to early participants, I knew it was a way of learning people enjoyed. It was also very close to a real-life workflow, so people were gaining hands-on experience coding a project using a design as a reference.  The next step was to put a few more projects on the site to see if people would complete multiple challenges. They did! At this point, I had validated a few things: Given a design and a project spec, people would try to build the project to practice writing front-end code.Once they finished their project, they’d often share their solution with their network to try and get feedback.People enjoyed the process, found it rewarding to build the projects, and were incredibly proud of their creations. Not only had I validated some key hypotheses, but I also realized that this was the perfect project for me to build. I loved everything about the idea, and I could see myself working on it for years to come. As you can see from this Wayback Machine snapshot from June 2018, the visual side of the site needed some work (oh, the irony!). Luckily, I’ve got a good friend who’s a brilliant designer, and he offered to pull together some simple branding and initial template designs as a favor. After a day’s work together, we had the Frontend Mentor brand and some designs ready! I went down my usual channels for the launch of the new-look site, plus I published articles on dev.to and Hackernoon, and a Show HN on Hacker News. With this launch, I also started up a Slack community. This was initially to provide a place for people to get help on projects and share their solutions. But I realized as the community grew that it was so much more than that. People were building friendships, collaborating on projects, giving feedback on the site, plus loads of other things. It was (and still is!) a great place to hang out! At this point, the site was just a static site using the WordPress API. There was no logging in, submitting projects, and getting feedback yet. My goal was to build incrementally to increase my chances of making the right decisions. The Slack community became my research group! Every day, talking to community members gave me a clear view of exactly what we needed for the first version of the web app. I’m a front-end developer by trade but can pull together a (very sketchy!) Node.js API. Before my evening teaching work at General Assembly, I’d often arrive early and set up shop in the communal area to get some coding done. I knew the GA staff well after years of teaching there part-time. One day, Mike, an instructor, sat down, and as we were chatting, he asked me what I was working on. I showed him Frontend Mentor, and he liked the idea so much he offered to help me out on it! I wasn’t actively looking for a co-founder, but Mike is a brilliant back-end developer, so our skills matched perfectly, and we get along really well, so we gave it a go.  He started working on it casually at first. After a few months, we were comfortable that we worked well together. So we decided to make it more formal, using the Slicing Pie method to start dividing equity while the business wasn’t making any money. We chose not to publicize the launch of the web app externally to help keep everything manageable. Instead, we focused on community feedback to build the right platform with the right features. At this point, we still hadn’t settled on a business model. We wanted to find one that was the right fit for ourselves and the community. Lots of people were asking for 1:1 mentorship and the ability to see an “official” solution. We didn’t want to build a mentorship marketplace, so that was a no-go. We also didn’t want to provide official solutions, as this could become a crutch for the community and would reduce the likelihood people would review each other’s code. We often received requests for the Sketch/PSD (Figma wasn’t that big back then) of the designs, seeing as we only provided JPGs in the challenges. This seemed like the perfect opportunity for an optional add-on. We quickly uploaded the design files to Dropbox and used Buy Me a Coffee to test the idea. Sure enough, some people started buying the designs...our first internet money!! Another request that started coming in was for more comprehensive challenges. People wanted showstopper portfolio projects to show hiring managers and help them get hired. So we tested “premium” challenges. These projects would be the closest thing you could get to a real-world project without actually being a professional developer. We launched one at first, and it started selling! Everything was single-purchase items to this point. So we decided to roll it all into a subscription and added some extra “PRO” features to the platform, like private solutions.  But before we could do that, we needed to “launch” the site more publicly. We knew people liked the concept, and we were on the road to a viable business. So it was time to push the site out to more people. A year after putting the beta web app live, we “launched” on Product Hunt. That may seem like a long time, but it was by design. A big mistake I’ve seen repeatedly happen on PH is people launching before they have an audience or a community. I was determined not to get over-excited about the PH launch and rush it before we had a solid foundation. The PH launch was a weird one. The UK had just gone into lockdown a week or so earlier, so I felt uncomfortable being overly salesy and promotional trying to promote Frontend Mentor. I nearly pulled the launch entirely but decided if I did, we might never launch, so it went ahead. We managed to earn 3rd place on a pretty competitive day, receiving lots of great feedback and publicity, which I counted as a win! Not long after that, Frontend Mentor started getting picked up in web development newsletters and even appeared in a CSS Tricks article written by Chris Coyier (front-end legend) himself! A few months later and we were ready to launch the PRO subscription. The community was excited, and we had some lifetime early bird offers for the first 500 subscribers. We managed to sell nearly $10K worth of subscriptions within the first few days, with a steady flow of subscriptions coming in after the initial splash. So we knew we had created something the community wanted. If I could have my time again, one major thing I’d do better is to move faster. I was too slow (I like to call it methodical, but who am I kidding?) validating the business model and launching the subscription. Realistically, we could have had a PRO subscription with design files and premium challenges up and running within months! ",," My background is actually in sports, exercise, and nutrition! I played a lot of sports growing up—basketball in particular. When I went to university, I studied Sport & Exercise Science. After uni, I set up a personal training business in my hometown of Cambridge. I enjoyed running my own business, but personal training wasn’t the right career for me. I enjoyed staying active and eating well, but I realized it wasn’t my passion. I still enjoyed a beer and a pizza a bit too often! As soon as I had that realization, I knew I needed to find a new path. But all the ideas I was having were for online businesses. I didn’t have the money to spend on getting someone else to build something, so I decided to self-teach. Back then, Lynda.com was the big platform, so I got stuck in learning Ruby on Rails over there. Very early on, I was watching a YouTube video when I came across a company called General Assembly. They had a 3-month full-time bootcamp based in London where you learn the fundamentals of web development with the view of becoming a professional developer. After completing the course, I got a job as a front-end developer. After a year or so of being a professional, I came back to GA on a part-time basis (evenings and weekends). I started as a teaching assistant on top of my full-time job. I hadn’t written a line of code until I was 28 years old, so I had a sense that there was some serious ground to make up. Teaching others was a strategy I knew would help move me forward faster while also getting myself back into the GA community, meeting others, and building my confidence as a developer. Another year on, and I felt ready to start teaching the courses and workshops I had been an assistant for. GA was happy for me to move up to become a part-time lead instructor, and so I started teaching the courses myself! It was through this teaching experience that the idea for Frontend Mentor came to me. At this point, I had been trying (and failing miserably) to launch a new fitness-related online business. I had been building an app for over half a year and still hadn’t launched anything, validated the idea, or even figured out a route to market. Out of frustration, I challenged myself to ship an unrelated idea in a couple of days.  The first idea that popped into my head was a front-end resource list for my students! Not original, I know, but it was something that was needed. I constantly shared the same front-end resources with my students, but I had no central resource to point them to. So I decided to create it. “Frontend Mentor” seemed like a good name, plus the .io domain was available, the person who owned the .com wasn’t using it, and the social handles were all available. So I got to work! After a couple of days, I had created my resource list and shared it with my network on LinkedIn, my students in General Assembly’s Slack channel, and the various (brand new) Frontend Mentor social channels. I received a bunch of positive feedback and thank you notes, which gave me a massive boost! It also made me think more about creating stuff for developers. After thinking more about typical problems my students had, I came up with another idea. A common question my students had when completing our Front-end Web Development 10-week part-time course was, “Where can I go to practice building projects and build up a portfolio?”. My first piece of advice was to build their projects and build sites for friends. However, they would come back by saying something along the lines of “But I’m no good at design. Anything I make looks amateurish. Where can I go to get designs?”. My second recommendation was to go to Dribbble, find a design, and build it in code. But many students would come back and say it was hard to find designs to work to, and once they did, the assets weren’t included, so it was hard to recreate the designs. When I was thinking about other difficulties for my students, my mind jumped to this problem. Why didn’t a website exist that provides developers with professional designs complete with starter code and optimized assets? That would remove so much friction and allow developers to focus on writing code with the additional benefit of creating beautiful-looking projects that would look great in any portfolio. So this is how Frontend Mentor was born!"," Although I said earlier I would have moved faster if I could have my time again, an important lesson has been not to rush things. New ideas pop into my head daily. One thing I’ve learned is not to be too impulsive. I could have easily taken Frontend Mentor in a completely different direction that may well have killed it completely by now. If you have an idea, sit on it for a bit. Take the time to talk to users (or potential users) about it and see if it keeps coming back to you. Good ideas always find a way of staying on your mind. I’ve had many nights where I can’t sleep because I’m thinking through all the ramifications of a potential new idea. If that starts often happening with an idea, it’s probably time to start building it! Also, be clear about why you’re creating your business. For us, it’s not all about growth and money. I genuinely believe that there’s a different way to run a business than the usual pressure cooker, growth at all costs approach. That’s not what we want for our lives. So why lie to ourselves and try to build a business in that way? Our goal for Frontend Mentor is to build a calm, sustainable business that is a pleasure to work in. If we’re lucky enough to grow a team, we plan to create a healthy work environment where everyone is treated with respect and trusted to do the work they were hired to do. It amazes me how many companies still treat their employees like children, forcing specific work hours and micro-managing every part of their role. I’ve read some books over the past couple of years that have shaped my thinking, and I’d recommend to anyone looking to build a calm company: Company of One by Paul JarvisLost and Founder by Rand FishkinStart Small, Stay Small by Rob WallingIt Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson (slightly hesitant to recommend this after the recent Basecamp announcements, but it’s still a good book)Essentialism by Greg McKeownThe Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson and Tim FerrissHappy Sexy Millionaire by Steven BartlettLife Profitability by Adii PienaarZero to Sold by Arvid Kahl  We’ll see what happens as the business grows, but it will be fun experimenting with different ways of working and finding what feels right for us! ‍"," Beyond the articles I mentioned above, I haven’t pro-actively done a huge amount of marketing. Most of our growth has come from word-of-mouth, with people recommending Frontend Mentor to others and sharing their solutions. One thing I noticed was that some people were streaming themselves taking our challenges. In some instances, they had pretty big audiences! So over time, I’ve built great relationships with some streamers. It’s perfect because they get brilliant content that they can create for their audience, their audience learns a ton, and Frontend Mentor gets excellent publicity. So it works well for everyone! Marketing is something I’m determined to get better at, though. There will be many incredible products out there that have died due to a lack of marketing savvy. I don’t want Frontend Mentor to be one of them!"," I don’t have a blog, so the best place to keep up to date with what I’m doing is my personal Twitter account. I’m not hugely active on there, but I post updates on Frontend Mentor. I enjoy writing, though, so tweeting more and starting up a blog is something I plan on doing!"," We use a bunch of tools that I’d happily recommend to other people creating an online business. First off, Mike and I are very privacy-focused people. So finding a privacy-first analytics solution was key. I’m a big fan of Paul Jarvis’ approach to business (after reading Company of One) and knew he had co-founded a privacy-first analytics company called Fathom Analytics, so we went with that. I’ve loved using Fathom and would recommend it to anyone looking for a privacy-first analytics solution! Our tech stack is all JavaScript-based, with MongoDB, Node.js, and Next.js. We’re toying with the idea of switching to PostgreSQL and a Rails API, but that’s not certain yet. We use Chargebee for subscription management and can’t recommend them highly enough. They’ve built a great solution, and their customer support is brilliant. We then use Stripe and PayPal as our payment gateways. We’ve also integrated Chargebee with ProfitWell for deeper insights on subscription metrics and monthly revenue goal tracking. The community that runs alongside our platform is a Slack community. If I were starting from scratch, I’d probably choose Discord instead. Discord is doing much more to support and build open communities. We’ve got over 60,000 people in our Slack community, though, and it’s doing a reasonable job. So the switching cost would be too high at this point. I’m also a member of the Founder Summit community, which is full of people focused on building calm companies.

80,gadget-flow," My name is Evan Varsamis, I’m an entrepreneur, founder, and CEO at Gadget Flow Inc, Contributor at Forbes, Inc and Amex Essentials, speaker, investor at Qrator Ltd and advisor at Crowdreach and Sprint Fund. I’m 27 currently based in New York. Gadget Flow is the number one platform to discover the best products on the market and stay up to date with the latest product releases and crowdfunding projects. Now Supporting AR & VR! We reach over 25M people per month with our web platform, apps, social media channels, and newsletters list. We’ve curated over 14,000 products within 180 categories and worked with over 6,000 brands since 2012 including HP, Pioneer, Sony, DJI, Polaroid and many others. We’ve helped thousands of crowdfunding projects by getting them exposure and backers through our platform and we are listed on both Kickstarter and Indiegogo as experts. We’ve recently launched our suite of products to keep it more organized as we are running lots of projects at the same time. We have our podcast in which we interview CEOs, Crowdfunding experts as well as creators that raised millions of dollars on Kickstarter or Indiegogo, our Business Services, our Augmented Reality project that we’ve been working on since last September by being one of the first eCommerce apps on the AppStore that integrated Apple’s ARKit, our latest product “Crowdinsight” that helps creators get honest feedback for their crowdfunding project and our exclusive deals and discounts section for our users. We are also working on the Gadget Flow Academy project that we’ll be launching later this year. ‍",," Managing a company of 25 people at 25 / 26 is fun but definitely challenging. Launching/growing your own business today requires total commitment, it’s nothing fancy for the first few years. 15 hour days, missing out on experiences with your friends and family because you have to work is not cool but it’s an investment towards your future and your company, if you keep remembering that you’ll be okay.  Like I’ve mentioned earlier one of our biggest challenges was hiring the right people at the right time, especially in the beginning we wanted to pretty much stretch ourselves as much as possible before hiring someone so we are 1000% sure that we need to fill that position.  Not hiring fast enough. You know, as a founder you think that you can do it all the first few months but that’s not true and I realized it the hard way after I had a minor burnout. The truth is that the faster your hire people to help you with the small tasks you can focus on growing your business.  Another mistake is hiring the wrong people. We didn’t have an HR manager or someone experienced in our team so it was 100% based on some key factors and our gut that lead to a couple bad hires throughout the years but looking at it from a percentage perspective our success rate is over 90% which is good.  ‍",,," Gadget Flow is headquartered in New York but it’s 100% remote with people from both west coast, east coast as well as Canada and Europe. Some people might say that at this stage not having an office might be a disadvantage but I’d disagree, being remote is one of the best decisions we’ve ever made it gives you the flexibility to travel and work as much as you want as well as change your work environment whenever you want.  We don’t have any direct competitors as a platform but instead many indirect that are trying to achieve the same results as Gadget Flow. On top of that, we have many copycats trying to copy our design/market approach every single day and our legal team has engaged with such websites over 15-20 just the past year. One of the things we are focusing on is to keep innovating and releasing new features and improvements for both our customers and users, this way it’s almost impossible for all these copycats to keep up with our progress. ‍", We launched Gadget Flow literally within 24 hours as we were very familiar with the process of building and launching a website. We’ve used a GoDaddy domain name and the cheapest hosting plan and a premium theme from Themeforest. The initial product looked nothing like today’s version. One of the most challenging things with Gadget Flow was the hiring process. Considering that we were just 21 when we launched the company we weren’t experienced and as a self-sustained and profitable business since the first year these decisions could make or break your business really fast. ‍,," I remember when I was 8 and I got my first computer that’s when I fell in love with technology. From games to hardware to software and everything in between. When I was 13 I started practicing coding and after a couple years graphic design. Before I turned 18 I launched a web design company with an older friend of mine and pitched our services to businesses while “having a website” was trending in Greece at that time. As soon as I graduated from an American high school in Athens Greece I went to study Shipping and Finance at BCA a London Metropolitan backed University in Athens. I got my BSc served 12 months in the Greek Navy which is mandatory and at the same time, I was working on a couple different blogs that I had with Cassie Ousta, my partner. As soon as I got my BSc I went to work for a shipping company for less than a year which is when I realized that I had to do something creative and something related to tech so I rented an office right across the shipping company that I was working part-time and launched a Media agency with my best friend Mike Chliounakis. We were focusing on Digital Advertising, Graphic and Web Design, Branding, etc. and at the same time, we were running the 2 blogs that I was working on with my partner Cassie. That’s when we came up with the idea of Gadget Flow on August 15th, 2012. We were struggling to find high-quality products online without having to read 1,000-word reviews or scrolling for hours on Amazon and we wanted to create a product discovery platform in which we’d surface great products every day! As soon as we launched Gadget Flow it took off organically. Therefore, I had to quit my part-time job in shipping and close the media agency in order to focus 100% on Gadget Flow."," I don’t have regrets and I wouldn’t change anything as I’m very grateful and excited with how things turned out.  If you could talk to your former self before Gadget Flow, what would you tell him? Be patient.Were you worried about anything when starting that you now realize doesn't matter? Fear is your worst enemy and I was afraid of failing but then I realized that the more committed, passionate and excited you are the fewer chances of failing.  ‍"," Gadget Flow grew organically during the first few months and then I kind of took over its growth. As a self-taught designer, developer, marketer and experienced with running, promoting and monetizing blogs, I had hundreds of ideas on how to promote and monetize Gadget Flow. Mid-2013 I started working 15-hour days A/B testing everything that we were doing from social media posts to designs to features and functionalities. We were trying to build our product on top of our user base by getting as much feedback as possible. We partnered with other companies, did a lot of cross-promotion, giveaways, and social media marketing. We started to see traction the first month we’ve launched Gadget Flow, people were hooked with the idea of surfacing and discovering cool products every single day and that’s why we’ve been publishing 12 new products every single day since 2012.  Growing a company without any kind of funding during the recession is not easy. For the first couple years, we were pretty much doing everything with just 4-5 people in total which was really tough and exhausting but definitely worth it. Our goal was to grow Gadget Flow organically without using ads, paid listings or paid partnerships and that’s exactly what we did. We got creative and it worked! We partnered with other brands and their social media accounts in order to acquire customers, kept optimizing our copy and a/b testing our marketing messages, launched weekly giveaways, partnered with brands in order to offer exclusive discounts and deals to our users and at the same time since our numbers were growing we had lots of customers reaching out to us wanting to advertise their products and that became our primary business model after 2013.  ‍"," You can find me on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin.

As an entrepreneur you keep thinking about ways to scale your business, generate more revenue, get more customers every single minute, I’ve had some of my best ideas while I was in the shower and I had to rush off, grab my phone and make notes. I didn’t read many books when I was a kid, in fact I started reading 3-4 years ago, I started with Steve Job’s biography then continued with a book called “Never Split the Difference” by Chris Voss which is related to negotiations and also inspired me to take a course at Harvard HBX (Negotiation Mastery) that I totally recommend if you are in a management position. I also read a couple books from Tony Robbins and followed Gary Vaynerchuck for about a year.

81,gameslog," I’m the founder & CEO of Array Internet which is a media company located in Frankfurt am Main (Germany). We mostly do web development, online marketing and SEO for international clients. Our most successful venture is MH Themes, which is a popular brand for magazine WordPress themes that are suitable for online magazines, news websites and advanced blogs. With MH Themes we cover more than 20,000 customers from over 110 countries around the world. ‍"," The main issue was that the site didn’t take off, although I’d put quite some time and money in the project. Publishing all the content, preparing screenshots, etc... we did this all manually as we didn’t want to import data via APIs in order to have truly unique content. However, except a few successful affiliate transactions, a few dollars from Google AdSense and some sponsored posts from gaming companies the site didn’t generate any revenue. The traffic was stuck as well as a few hundred visitors per month. If I remember correctly, the record was around 900 unique visits per month. Unfortunately, with this low traffic, you’ll usually have a hard time to monetize an affiliate site, at least if you’re covering a niche where the affiliate commission is not very high. ‍",,,," I think the biggest disadvantage was that the market was already saturated with this kind of gaming affiliate sites. There were some very large and popular competitors and it was incredibly difficult to rank well for good keywords. I definitely should have done more research before starting the site. My mistake was that I simply wanted to start this out of fun, without doing research if it would be a good and reliable business idea. Today I wouldn’t make this mistake again, except if I wanted to start such a site as a hobby. ‍",,," A few years ago I was getting more and more interested in affiliate marketing. While I was running various online magazines at that time, I didn’t have much experience with affiliate sites. However, one day I stumbled upon a gaming site which was promoting several online games. I liked the idea and did some research. I noticed that various affiliate programs were paying good commission just for leads where users would sign up to play an online game for free (the companies were monetizing the games by selling in-game items or other goodies). I thought if I would be able to scale my own gaming site to a reasonable amount of traffic, then this could pay off very well. At least that’s what I thought. ‍"," I definitely would do thorough research before starting an online business. It’s crucial to have a look at the competition and analyze keywords to determine if you have a chance to compete with reasonable resources. The benefit of an online business is that you have valuable data available before you even get started. I absolutely would work with that data and then make a decision.  Even if starting an online business is quite easy, you shouldn’t make it an easy decision. If you make a wrong decision at the start, it can become a huge waste of time and money. This can be avoided by doing your homework before you get started. Another advice I have is to always stay focused. If you’re smarter than I was when I started the gaming affiliate site and if you’ve done your homework, it’s crucial to stay focused on your main business objectives. Stick to your plan and don’t get lost in details or unprofitable tasks. ‍"," First of all, I hired various writers to create a lot of content. I coded functionality so that we could easily add online games into a database and list these games based on various criteria including screenshots and play buttons with affiliate links. I was hoping that if we create enough content and did some SEO, then we would be able to get organic traffic from Google. I also reached out to various game production companies in order to cooperate and get additional exposure. This worked better than expected, but since the site was very new without a reliable track record, many companies weren’t interested in doing business with us. As always, doing business is much easier if you’re already established and successful. In addition, I started building social channels, launched various giveaways and also tried to get some additional traffic through PPC advertising."," You can follow me on Twitter, check out our WordPress themes and on Array Internet we’ve recently started a blog where we’ll soon publish editorial content about online marketing, social media marketing and other topics that could be helpful for digital entrepreneurs.",,,Entertainment,Competition,Germany,"March 17, 2018",Michael Hebenstreit,https://www.failory.com/interview/gameslog,"['https://twitter.com/m_hebenstreit', 'https://arrayinternet.com/wordpress/', 'https://arrayinternet.com/blog/']",failure,0,,"Gameslog was a gaming site monetized with affiliate marketing.

82,gawkbox," I’m Chris Brownridge. I’m 35, I hail from the UK but now based in Seattle, USA. After more than 3 years, $4.4M in venture funding, 500k users and more than $1M in revenue, we recently shut GawkBox down. As a first time CEO and Co-Founder, there’s a lot of lessons that merit sharing for others who are embarking on the same journey. Our vision at GawkBox was to help content creators (YouTubers, Twitch streamers) make a living doing what they love. We built a platform where viewers of live streams could play mobile games to donate real money to streamers. The best part was that the viewers had to pay nothing -- it was the mobile game publisher (such as Rovio, who make Angry Birds) that funded the donation to the streamer on the viewer’s behalf. GawkBox took a % of the transaction. An early “About GawkBox” video: ‍"," In spite of our early success, we didn’t maintain that momentum. The success of our platform was reliant on three different customers: the mobile game publisher (who paid for the donations to the influencer), the influencer her/himself (who needed to talk about GawkBox to their fans), and the fans (who needed to play the games to trigger the donation). For a mobile game publisher to continue using our platform, they needed to see a return on their investment -- generally through fans that continued to play their games. Unfortunately, many fans would download games to trigger donations and then not play any further, meaning that paying for our platform became unsustainable for the game publishers. While we made efforts to create a more sustainable model for them, we lost many of those early customers -- and with fewer games to play paying fewer dollars, influencers and their fans became less and less interested in our platform.  In spite of that, we were still early in the life of the company at that point and may have had the opportunity to change course, but I believe one particular strategic moment steered us down a pathway that became ever more challenging. When we raised our second round of funding in July 2017, we focused our pitch to investors around the burgeoning live-streaming market. We felt that this represented our best chance to raise capital -- live streaming was one of the hottest investment trends of the year. We made this decision in spite of the fact that the recorded video on YouTube had been the primary driver behind our initial explosive growth. However, we felt that YouTube just wasn’t exciting for investors and believed we needed something more to raise investment. We successfully raised capital with our live streaming pitch and that set the frame around many of our strategic decisions moving forward -- including how to address our declining revenue as game publishers deserted the platform.  From that moment on, everything that we focused on was in the live streaming space. We ignored some of the positive signals we saw from YouTube in favor of the unproven live streaming ecosystem (for us at least). We spent the next 18 months developing different features for live streamers -- none of which repeated the initial success that we had. By late 2018, with only 6 months of cash left in the bank, it was becoming clear to me that it was going to be challenging to get to a point where we could raise another round of financing. We made lay-offs to give ourselves more time to find some positive product metrics and raise a new round of financing. We didn’t have much time -- I needed to be out fundraising early 2019 to have any chance of raising. Our team and board of directors went back to the drawing board. Over Christmas 2018 we came up with a new concept that represented somewhat of a pivot from our original approach -- and over the space of just four weeks, we built a team-based competitive gaming platform for content creators. We launched an alpha test of the revamped platform late January 2019 and for the first time since summer 2017, saw great initial metrics. With a glimmer of hope, we continued to develop the concept -- knowing that I needed to be out fundraising within a few weeks to have a shot at extending the life of the company. With our beta about to release to 100 content creators and their fans, Apple took the wind out of our sails -- we were rejected from the App Store.  It took more than 10 weeks to get approved -- by this time it was early May and we had just weeks of cash left. We ran out of time. During a board meeting at 10 pm on July 3rd, 2019 we made the difficult decision to shut the company down, letting the remaining team of 9 go. After more than 3 years and $4.4M raised, we had failed to take the company to where we everyone was expecting us to -- and I entered into a summer of insecurity with my tail between my legs. "," This section could easily turn into a novel, so I’ll try to be brief! GawkBox was my first “proper” time as a founder & CEO. I went through a lot of firsts as CEO -- raising capital, reporting to investors, managing a board of directors, owning recruiting (both employees and board members), setting vision & owning company strategy… the list goes on. The first time that you do almost anything in life, you generally aren’t that great at it -- on the whole, I think starting and running a company is the same. It takes experience and practice to get better. As a CEO, I now realize that you have so many responsibilities, but you only have the same amount of time in the day as everyone else does. Layer in a young family, and it means you have to be extremely good at prioritization, time management, and decision making… and it is very hard.   I often prioritized the wrong things.  Sometimes I deprioritized having external conversations because I had other things on my plate: legal, health insurance, accounting…these are very important, but there are others who can take this responsibility from the CEO. This led me to have a suboptimal understanding of the market we were in -- I didn’t talk to enough customers or other companies in the ecosystem. Because I didn’t have a maniacal focus on the customer, it meant that we didn’t have an organization-wide customer-driven culture and in the end, it led to us not building a product that customers truly needed. By deprioritizing conversations with other companies in our space (competitors or potential partners), I didn’t have as good a picture of the live streaming ecosystem as I should have -- and also limited our strategic partnership options when I most needed them.  We could’ve invested our money more intelligently.  We may have found ourselves in a different scenario these past few months if we had been more frugal with our spending immediately after raising our last investment round. Flush with close to $4M in the bank and believing that we had the next billion-dollar business, we prematurely set about investing in growth -- just 3 months later we’d more than doubled the team and were spending an equal amount on sales & marketing as we were on engineering. However, at that point our product had shown only poor retention metrics -- so we spent more cash filling our leaky bucket up faster only for our churn to increase. We ramped our sales & marketing spend out of sync with our product development.",,,," For the first year or so, we actually ran the business like an agency. We leveraged existing tools and did not build any technology of our own. While we knew the mobile game space well, we did not know the influencer space well -- so we chose to learn about that side of the market by operating an agency for our first year. We worked with many influencers to run interesting game-integrated content, such as this video we made for Big Fish Games’ Gummy Drop.  This strategy not only allowed us to learn about the influencer market, but also generated enough capital for us to hire others around us, including bring on our third co-founder, Tony -- and ultimately raise our first small round of $700k in December 2016 from London Venture Partners. Until that point, we were entirely self funded.  We raised that first round from an idea and a presentation. Our original concept was a platform for advertisers to find, analyze and run campaigns with YouTube influencers. Interestingly, within weeks of that money hitting the bank, we completely changed what we wanted to build, pivoting to our GawkBox idea that allowed fans to support content creators by playing mobile games. I’ll always remember our first official board meeting in January 2017 -- we were pretty nervous about how our board member and main investor would think about us changing the product vision entirely (it turned out we had nothing to worry about!). After we learned of the support of our board members, we set about building the MVP to get to market as quickly as we could. As we hadn’t managed to hire full-time Engineering by this point, we offshored development for this first version. We had a functioning (if poorly designed!) product a few weeks later which we launched to our waitlisted test customers with haste in the spring of 2017, before opening it up more widely shortly after. It might not have looked great, but it certainly worked as intended -- shortly after full public launch we were seeing hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of signups per day. We catapulted from making zero revenue to at one point hitting $7k in a single day, all within a couple of months. ‍",," I come from an entrepreneurial family -- my mother and father have been running a metal fabrication business for more than 30 years. Ever since my teenage years, I’ve been running with different business ideas. In the eBay glory days of the early 2000s, I would try and fund my social life by buying and selling whatever I could get my hands on -- from bread baskets, to cameras and concert tickets. I ended up getting my father’s company eBay account banned… who knew that reselling concert tickets was against TOS!?  After a stint working for an artificial intelligence company in Paris (VirtuOz - acquired by Nuance), I spent 4 years at Google where I tried a couple of other ventures, including a Google Adwords PPC agency and one my mother was most proud of -- a monthly condom subscription company! Neither really got off the ground. While Google was an incredible learning experience, I was always getting itchy feet and found myself looking for something that could better cater to my entrepreneurial mind. Through some networking, I found the co-founders of a small mobile advertising company called Vungle -- fellow Brits, they had just moved to San Francisco for an incubator called AngelPad. They were pre-launch and pre-revenue, with a tiny team -- I took a gamble on joining them and hastily moved to San Francisco from London in 2012. Vungle (later acquired by Blackstone) gave me the incredible opportunity to build a hugely successful global company from scratch, leading an organization across 5 global locations and witnessing ‘rocketship’ type growth that doesn’t come around often. As exciting as it was to play a leadership role, I always had the desire to do it as CEO -- so after close to 4 years I left Vungle, moved to Seattle with my wife and started GawkBox with an old Vungle colleague shortly after. The idea for GawkBox came out of our vast experience in the mobile advertising market from Vungle. We had a lot of relationships in that space which allowed us to identify a pain point -- back at the start of 2016 that pain point was working with influencers to scale user acquisition. We envisaged building a new type of mobile ad network but focused on influencers.  "," I like to look at this as “what will I do differently next time” -- as I think it’s important to note that in spite of the outcome not being what we wanted, nor expected, I don’t regret anything about the experience. We achieved a lot at GawkBox -- raising $4.4M, getting to 500k and making more than $1M in revenue is no small feat, and I’m extremely proud of that. If I were to replay the experience and take a different pathway, I may not have experienced what I did or acquired the skills that I did -- all of which will set me up even better for my future endeavors. After reflecting on my experience for the past few months, there are some key aspects that I would think about differently next time around.  Spend more time with customers, particularly as CEO. Three types of customers are too many -- you simply don’t have the capacity to understand each of them deeply enough!Use that customer time to ensure that you’re building something customers actually need. Cure their cancer, don’t scratch an itch. Create a product that solves an ongoing pain so that people will pay for it, repeatedly.Better understand the unit economics of the business so you know how many users/customers you need to make it work. Force yourself to have conversations with other companies in the space. Know your competition, but don’t be afraid of them. You can out-execute them!Wait until you have strong product retention before scaling sales & marketing investment. (I’m not saying don’t invest at all -- but optimize investment toward areas that will help you validate the product is what people need)Take heed of your data when making strategic decisions. Recognize when something is working, and when something is not.When difficult situations arise (and they always will) -- focus on how much you’re learning from it to help you get through. "," Rather than marketing strategies, we leaned predominantly on an outbound sales model to acquire new customers (YouTubers and streamers) to our product. Our team was extremely effective at striking up conversations with content creators using a tried and tested playbook. We leveraged an offshore team to generate hundreds of thousands of leads and would feed them into an automated outbound contact process using Yesware. This was certainly effective insofar as acquiring influencers to our product (over 2 years, we added more than 20k to the platform), especially at the outset. It helped that our solution was innovative and first to market -- our promise was built on a way for influencers to earn easy money, who wouldn’t sign up!? In our first few months, we talked to thousands of influencers who, on the whole, saw incredible results from the product at the beginning. These results drove further growth via word of mouth -- adding hundreds of new influencers each day taking us rapidly to that $7k day in revenue. One YouTuber earned so much money from us, he managed to buy a house with his earnings! GawkBox story of the YouTuber who bought a house with his GawkBox earnings: ‍"," I wrote more about my journey and lessons learned for Entrepreneur’s Handbook here. Currently, I am testing some other ideas out within my own personal incubator, Pastel Frog, and am advising other early-mid stage startups."," I listen to a lot of podcasts, My First Million, Creator Lab and How I Built This. I’d recommend every entrepreneur read The Mom Test, a great guide on validating problems with customers. I am also a member of Trends by the Hustle - which is a great weekly newsletter for entrepreneurs! ‍"," Initially, after launching our MVP we grew revenue very quickly - growing from $0 to over $100k MRR in just a couple of months. We leveraged that momentum to raise our second round of financing of just over $3.7M, following on from a small $700k in late 2016. Even at this early stage, GawkBox appeared to be on track to make significant business and was certainly a horse that many bets on.  Just 2 years after raising that $3.7M, we found ourselves in a very different situation. Our bank balance was dwindling. Our significant user base (more than 500k) was now mostly inactive. We’d spent the majority of our investment funding different product iterations that did not materially change the economic outlook for the company. We decided to pause on efforts to raise additional capital for the business and made the difficult decision to close the business. While we made over $1M in revenue, we were experimenting with different business models and found it difficult to keep our cost of goods sold (COGS) predictable. Our lifetime gross margin was under 10%, leaving us with precious little to cover our expensive personnel costs. As a software company, the majority of our expenses were people based and our OPEX was generally proportional to the size of the team we had -- generally ranging from $100k to $200k per month. The only outliers to this were around fundraising events when legal costs made up a significant portion of monthly operating expenses.

They do this unpaid as part of their training to gain work experience. For small business owners, they pay a 49$ month membership fee to access our marketplace tools and support. Students get feedback and guidance from the businesses and the businesses get an extra hand in growing their companies. It’s a win-win for both parties. My job at GenM is focused on building our team to achieve our mission of creating a free education system for everyone. ‍",," When I was in construction I was top of my industry. I was making more money than I could spend and had a comfortable position with strong growth prospects. I was not satisfied with being comfortable and made the hardest decision of my life to leave all that behind and start in a new industry.  When I was leading my construction organization we were winning and growing. When I left, two of my companies failed. It was hard. When I pivoted into tech I was a nobody with no experience, network or status. I spent two years before GenM launching product after product and failing every time. I was no stranger to failing, but this was different. I was failing on all fronts, for a long time and that had never happened to me before. Being ignorant in tech I grew my team without knowing if I had product-market fit. That forced me to sell real estate I owned to fund the company because it was pre-revenue and we did not have a clear product-market fit to raise capital. The product failed, and I was left with no more real estate and over a million dollars in losses. To add during this time my personal life was going downhill. Me and my wife separated and my father was in a coma from a heart attack. So here I was at the bottom of a new industry, failing for years, with 1+ million in losses, and alone. I wanted to quit and go back to construction. My wife at the time told me I would not succeed. My best friend and business partner in the construction organization told me I would not succeed. My family told me I would not succeed. If I quit now I would cede failure. To me failing is quitting. Until you quit, you have not truly failed, you are only losing. I grew up poor, fat, and ignorant. My family came to this country with nothing. I changed my life before and became a self-made millionaire, married the women of my dreams and was super fit I knew I could do it again. I was down, but not dead. As long as I could move, I would. With every step, I learned. With every step, I became stronger. I emptied my cup totally and cleaned my slate. I became a student again with unlimited potential. My forays into tech before GenM failed but they did teach me a lot and they did allow me to meet my future co-founders in GenM. This time things were different. This time we would follow the right process every step of the way. I would assume nothing and trust only what I knew deeply and what could be proven with data. Slowly we started winning again. One-win lead to another. Momentum shifted. My personal life became significantly better, my fitness increased, my business was doing better. Every day I come to work I guard my state of mind. I never want to feel or be in a position like I was again. That fear helps give me drive, but ultimately it was the knowledge that we could help millions that made me look beyond myself through all the pain and suffering it was finding my purpose that lifted me out of darkness  My greatest disadvantage for starting a tech company is being located in Ottawa Ontario. Proximity is power. I am far away from the tech mekka in the Bay area. That means less talent, funding, and scale. We found ways to overcome this and turn it into an advantage however if we build GenM in the Bay area first we likely have scaled sooner. My worst mistakes were not following the right process early on and hiring the wrong people. We managed to learn from this, but at a great cost. ‍",," Our goal is to create a free education system for everyone that leads to jobs. We are one of the fastest growing startups in Canada and doubling our team right now.  We want to become the place where students come to launch their careers and small businesses come to grow.  In our future students can come and test almost any career path they want. They will be able to explore what they want without committing to a 4-year program. This will significantly reduce uncertainties and wasted time and money because they will have a greater degree of certainty into what career they want, having done on the job training for it. In our future, a student will be able to learn on the job under different skilled business owners. They will be able to build this resume, gain work experience, a professional network, skills, and confidence. They will have access to course work from top course providers that we will partner with so anything they want to learn, they can, before, during and after their job training. They will be able to showcase their work on their profiles which dub as a portfolio. They will be ranked based on their performance on the job, and will be head hunted by employers looking for talent directly on our platform. They will be able to meet up with a cohort of other students at a different physical location around the globe. They will be able to attend yearly events held by GenM as a right of passage. Success for our students means they gained either employment, confidence, or relationships that positively impacted their lives. Our students will be able to launch their careers, with no debt, faster, and more effectively than they can today. In our future, a small business owner will be able to get the affordable talent they need to grow. We will become part of a business’s daily workflow supplying both tools and talent to help them. A business will be able within 48 hours to find a match that is ideal for them. With very little effort they will be able to onboard and get productive work from a student in a structured and professional way, consistently. They will be able to work with one or a team of students using the collaboration tools we build. Because of GenM and employer will have an accurate measure of performance of a candidate before they hire them because our students will be rated and reviewed consistently throughout their training by businesses in the field.  Once trained students can get hired by businesses who are looking for trained talent supplying the workforce with trained talent. ‍",," At first, GenM was not obvious. We were very skeptical and cautious in our approach. We had been burned in the past by investing way too much into ideas that did not pan out and wanted to follow a methodological process in testing and proving out our idea. We actually started with just a landing page that had no real product and funneled traffic to the page to see if the idea we had would convert. It did. We then put a paywall to see how motivated students would be if money was involved. Many paid. That gave us more conviction, but we were still caution and decided to roll out an MVP for courses. This would provide a one player mode for students and help us build one side of the marketplace, a key requirement for attracting business clients. Originally, we planned on spending only a few months on courses but we ended up iterating for 9 months. At first, we tried to invent a method for learning that we thought was effective, but this turned out to be a waste of time and we decided to learn from the best education apps. With that strategy, we were able to accelerate our product development and we had a solid road map. We knew our key innovation was not in course work but in apprenticeships so we wanted to focus our energies on innovating there. We ran into a ton of obstacles along the way including not having the right people, running out of money, not generating revenue, not being confident that we are building the right thing. All the classic startup foibles. However, our vision was strong, and we had some very promising data, along with our own experience so we persevered and kept learning/iterating. The lesson we knew was to trust the process. When building a company, you may not see results right away, or at least not until you hit “product-market fit” However if you follow the right process, this is usually a matter of time. Much like going to the gym. You don’t see gains right away but if you trust the process you will realize your gains. As a team, we were very disciplined in our approach to building a product and business. For a long time, it was just us co-founders toiling away in our offices all day and night. Eventually, we launched our apprenticeship marketplace. and that was when everything changed. We started generating revenues. We started growing. We had invented something novel and unique and had so much experience and a clear vision into what we were building that we started to see product-market fit. We did not want to get distracted with press so we kept quiet and no one knew about us. The only thing that mattered to us was building a business that has a clear product-market fit and can scale to achieve the mission we set. Our clients were the only external people we focused on.",," The concept for GenM originated while I was struggling to find help as a small business owner. I would hire volunteer students to help me grow, and ended up employing many. These were students who were struggling to find jobs because they lacked work experience. After working with me and my businesses they became hireable and were able to launch their careers. I thought nothing of this for over 5 years as I worked with more and more students most of whom went on to launch successful careers. Eventually, I decided to switch out of construction and into the tech industry. It was one of the toughest decisions of my life because I knew nothing of tech beforehand. I had lots of logical reasons for switching but mostly it was because I was drawn to infinite possibilities that you can design and build through technology. A few years ago, my co-founders and I were working on a project building out a social media application. We were hiring a marketing intern for the project and put out a job ad. We saw the same pattern where we would get 200 applicants for one internship position, almost all of whom had no work experience. My co-founder, Richard saw this as a problem and started thinking about the issue. Why was there such a high demand for work experience from students? That thought experiment turned into months of research into the education system and a realization that the system is fundamentally broken for millions of students. Post-secondary has become costly in time, money and was ineffective for many in launching their careers. With an understanding of the student’s and businesses motivations and problems, we started imagining what the future would look like if we designed an education system, from first principles. This led us down a path that would forever change our lives and the lives of thousands of students and business owners. We imagined a world where students would get trained by industry for industry, faster than traditional schooling and free. In our world education was free, accessible and leads to jobs. This sounded like a fantasy, and thinking back it was a really big ambition. At the time we had no real product-market fit in our social media app but had a lot of experience launching products together. We decided to drop the app to focus on building an education company. We knew it would take years to build anything remotely close to what we imagined so we created a multi-phase plan in achieving our mission. This was a mission that was personal to us, and was important enough to dedicate our lives too. We started with free courses, then moved on to apprenticeships and certifications. Now we are building out a suite of collaboration tools to enable businesses and students to collaborate together. We are at the base of a very big mountain, with a mission that will make a positive impact on the lives of millions. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. ‍"," If I could do things differently I would have started into tech the same way we started GenM. With a small team of talented co-founders who had complementary skills and mindsets and the same drive. I would have followed the right process from day 1 and started with an MVP, business hypothesis and data points to prove product-market fit. I have no regrets and would change nothing about starting GenM. We learned from our previous mistakes and did things right. ‍"," Early on our growth strategies were straight hustling. I would post in Facebook groups and created a simple funnel for getting small businesses on the phone. Once I had them on the phone I knew our value prop was too good to pass and I closed the first 200 businesses doing this. The first few calls were awkward but soon I built a script and my confidence grew. I managed to close ⅓ of my calls in the first interaction. That led me to hire a salesperson while I focused on other growth channels. I knew this hack would not last us forever. As we grew we started building out our marketing machine with a heavy focus on referrals. Our product was novel enough that businesses would share it, so we created a high-quality referral program that just blew up. This felt great because referrals are highly scalable and a great indication that you have something valuable. We then layered in a marketing mix to support our referral channel and have been growing steadily since then. On the student side, we did much the same thing by finding communities of marketers that we pitched on getting work experience. When building a two-sided marketplace you have two distinct clients with different needs that you have to service. This requires a different approach for each and to add you have to grow both sides at the same pace. This added complexity was hard and required us to have to growth team for each side. We ended up following a lot of what worked on the business side for our student side along with some key partnerships that helped us grow. ‍", Follow me on Instagram @realmoeabbas to see live streams of our offices and what we do.

84,gorails," I’m Chris Oliver. I’m a 32-year-old Ruby on Rails developer from St. Louis, MO, USA.  I’ve been spent the last handful of years building GoRails into an ecosystem of products to support the Ruby on Rails community.  At first, I started with screencasts for Ruby on Rails developers to help teach them how to build web applications. Over time, I added a hosting service for Ruby on Rails apps called Hatchbox.io. My latest project is JumpstartRails.com which is a business template for building SaaS apps quickly in Ruby on Rails. I do all the marketing, sales, support, and software development across the products. I’m starting to build up a team as it’s grown way past what I can do as a single person anymore. ",," I should've done more marketing and hired sooner. Things could have grown faster. I didn’t pay myself a salary for 2 years. I wouldn't ever want to start a business from scratch like that again. That was super hard. It’s a struggle that most people have when they're on their startup for the first time. You see a few people who build something and make $500,000 in the first year, but chances are they either got lucky or had an existing audience. I want to build something that's sustainable long-term. I'm not trying to build upon the current hype. Many bootcamps have raised tons of venture capital, and they tried to grow fast, and after a few years, they shut down and have to let go of all their employees. Everything depends on the product that you build. I built 3 very different products. Right now, I publish a screencast every week on GoRails, which is a time commitment. Then I have the hosting service, Hatchbox, an even bigger time commitment with less ROI than the others. And then the business template, JumpstartRails, which is probably the best ROI for the time that I give it. It's been fascinating to see those, compare them, and figure out where I want to invest my time.  The more your product is critical to the day-to-day operations of someone else's business, the more critical it is that you have perfect response times for support. Other products may grow slower but don't require hardly any support. Totally different businesses or products to run. It's been interesting to find a balance between all three that have different demands. ",," GoRails is doing $60,000 in MRR, which is very good as a single-person business. I have more and more ideas every day on things I wish I had the time to build. The business is bigger than I ever imagined. It has grown to more than I can handle as a single person, so I'm trying to grow the company and hire developers or support people. I've also been doing a lot of open source work lately. It’s a great marketing tactic because people use my JAM, learn about me and then find out that I make videos, and they'll probably check them out. I want to continue investing in the Ruby on Rails community. ",," Selling my first product was pretty tough. I had tried for years to build something on nights and weekends. I know my psychology and realized if I were going to make something work, I’d have to force myself to figure it out.  I burned the bridges and quit consulting completely on January 1st, 2014. I had enough runway for about 9 months of building my own thing, and then I’d have to get a job. My burn rate was low, so I figured I had a chance. I started out building a course to teach people Ruby on Rails. My thought process was that it’s my first product, and I don’t want to commit to anything that I may not want to do forever. By building a course, I wasn’t committing to doing anything long-term, and I could experiment. I spent those 9 months trying to get comfortable screencasting. It turned into two courses. One was free one was paid. They were designed around what I was doing, which was consulting. I was taking my experience and trying to productize it, but it didn't work out because nobody knew who I was.",," Before I started GoRails, I was working full-time consulting for startups and other small businesses. It was frustrating doing months of work to see it go to waste over and over again because our clients didn't implement it. I really, really wanted to build something that people used. This pushed me to burn out on consulting badly., so I had to figure out a way to make a successful product that motivated me. The idea came to me after purchasing GoRails.com to share my notes for Ruby on Rails development publicly. My website started getting a lot of traffic. Since I had traffic already, I figured I’d try to sell something to these visitors. In the past, I had always tried to build ideas without any way of marketing them. I am a developer, not a marketer, so I had always made products but never got any users. This time was different because I was selling to an audience I already had. Plus, they were people I love to talk with: other developers! "," You just have to build stuff and talk to people. You need to find those people to talk to and be sure you want to talk to them. I was selling to developers these are the people I want to chat with all the time. Once you've found a group of people, you can continue building products for them. That is something I just didn't grasp very well before I started. You can look at Quip, for example, which sells toothbrushes on a subscription. They keep adding other products you will eventually need, like toothpaste, shaving cream, and razors, because their subscribers trust them."," I needed to get my name out, and I could do that by making free videos and sharing them. I started tu publish every new video for free. If I were publishing lots for free, it would build up trust, and then people would learn from me, and they’d be willing to buy from me. So I started publishing a video every single week.  One day, I was out of money looking for a job and found out someone had submitted GoRails to the top of Hacker News. Y Combinator startups had used Ruby on Rails to build their products. And that was a great place for GoRails to be. That day I got +600 email addresses, and I was able to use the email addresses to send them stuff about what I was doing, new videos, and keep them up to date. The newsletter became a pretty important piece of the business. ‍"," You can check GoRails, Hatchbox, and JumpstartRails. You can find me on Twitter and my personal blog, which I don’t update much."," I use YouTube and Twitter a lot to publish content. I used to listen to podcasts more when I was commuting. I listened to Startups For the Rest of Us. I think that the book that influenced me the most was probably Robert Greene's Mastery. Really hit me at a time where I realized what I wanted to do with my life. The book talks about people who become true masters. They find mentors, whether it's in person or through books and writing. You can have a mentor from a podcast host who doesn't know you exist. I realized I should find something to sink my teeth into and become an expert at, and that's was Ruby on Rails.

85,graphite-docs," Hi! My name is Justin Hunter, I’m 36 (though my wife and kids like to tell me I’m 40 already), and I live in Dallas, TX. My background has largely been in customer-facing roles (customer service, management, customer experience, and sales), but I took a non-traditional path to development and have been coding for the last three years. In fact, I’m working on contract development work now. Because of my experience with Graphite (and subsequently another startup called SimpleID), I get a bunch of interest from companies in the crypto space.  Graphite Docs was the catalyst for everything—learning to code, starting a business, entering the blockchain space. It was a privacy-focused alternative to Google Docs. Rather than create an account with a company that owned every piece of your data, Graphite allowed you to create user accounts anchored to the bitcoin blockchain, cryptographically owned by you, and created documents that were encrypted with keys only you had access to. And to top it all off, Graphite allowed you to store data wherever you want (Graphite didn’t even maintain a document database).  As a sole founder, my job was to write the code, market, sell, do demos, attend events, and pretty much everything else under the sun. Early on, I had no business model in mind. I really didn’t care if people even used it. But when it started getting traction, I introduced a b2b SaaS model, despite cries from the crypto-community to do something in cryptocurrency.  ‍"," I know I’m not the only one to feel this way, but my first inclination here is to blame outside influences. Things beyond my control. And sure, maybe there was a bit of that in Graphite’s failure, but at the end of the day, Graphite failed for the same reason most companies fail—lack of execution.  I took that early traction to mean I had found product/market fit. I took my foot off the gas when it came to talking to and understanding users. Part of that is because I had originally built Graphite for myself, so I was the only user I cared about. But the other part is I saw people writing about Graphite, I saw them using Graphite, and I believed that I was the one founder in the history of time to get it right on the first try.  The truth is—and I wish I better understood this or could see it when I was starting Graphite— you never get it right. Every decision you make will eventually be the wrong decision, even if it’s right in the moment. The path to success is being flexible and willing to adapt based not on opinion but on user feedback.  I knew that the user base for Graphite was niche. When I first started exploring a revenue model, I would estimate that 70-80% of Graphite’s users fell into the blockchain enthusiast bucket. Another 10-15% were privacy-focused consumers, and the remaining percentage MIGHT have been normal everyday users. Yet, I ignored that. I knew that privacy was important. I knew there was a gap in privacy-focused tools for businesses, and I pressed forward with a business model centered around b2b sales of Graphite as an enterprise solution to companies who cared about privacy.  Why did I choose b2b versus consumer? Why did I focus on what would amount to a new market rather than focus on the existing base who was using my product? I have thought about this a lot, and the answer always falls back to comfort. My background has been in b2b for a long time. That’s where I was comfortable operating. I could market to b2b, I could do product demos, and I could talk the corporate language. But no amount of comfort and experience can force a market to adopt your product.  I had a built-in user base that was OK with the complexity of using Graphite—and there was definitely some complexity around the blockchain and cryptography aspects of it—but I chose to sell to an audience that I knew from experience struggled with managing simple Microsoft Word documents. I chose to sell to a market that has IT departments and system admins that take care of user accounts and password resets. I went to this audience and said, “Hey, what if you could control your user accounts, control your files, and collaborate privately and securely.” They heard the last part and liked that, but they could not and did not want to manage the first part.  The above is all compounded by the fact that it took me longer to realize this than it should have because I had a safety net. Because I was building in a cutting-edge tech sector, and because there were many competing protocols, the protocols themselves would often offer grants for engineers building on their platforms. It’s very similar to the way researchers in the early internet days were funded by universities and government grants. So, I had users, I had press coverage, and I had money coming in. Never mind that the money wasn’t coming from users of my product. Never mind that the press coverage was generating new individual users, not businesses. Never mind that having money doesn’t mean you have a business.  I think a lot of founders who take on venture capital run into the same problem, except they actually have people to answer to. In my case, I just had money and I had a product, and I thought I had made it. I had an advisor who begged me to keep my day job because it would force me to make smart decisions about how Graphite would operate. But as soon as that grant money came in, I went full-time on Graphite. I don’t know that I would change that decision, but I do know that he was right about needing something to force you to make tough choices.  I was blind to the needs of the market because I had tricked myself into thinking I had found the solution.  This all sounds very egotistical, but these realizations did not come at the time, of course. They have come with the benefit of hindsight. I only recognize them now that the company is shutting down because I’ve taken the time to consider my entire experience.  I knew Graphite was probably done for by the summer of 2019. So much so that I started another startup and focused on that while Graphite just sort of existed. I let Graphite linger on until now because it just felt like I was giving up to shut it down. By the summer of last year, though, it was clear that businesses weren’t going to be using Graphite. And as for that blockchain and privacy-focused user base? They’d been using Graphite for free for two years now. There was no chance of pivoting into a consumer model and charging those people by then.  A few weeks ago, I made the decision to shut the doors. I had a friend and advisor who had put some money into Graphite before I started getting the grant money, and telling him was the hardest thing I had to do. I had lost his money with nothing to show for it. But I told him first, then I started the process of filling out the tax and state documents to shut the company down. Finally, I sent out the email to everyone on Graphite’s mailing list about the shutdown. The interesting thing about the way that Graphite worked is that I never had access to anyone’s content. It was always stored wherever the user or the business chose to store it. So, in theory, even after Graphite shut down, they’d always be able to access their content. In practice, though, this was harder than it seemed. I built an exporter for the more technically inclined and I included export instructions for those who wanted to download their content from the interface.  Despite how hard it was to do all of that, I felt good when it was done. Graphite had become an obligation that I could not fulfill. It was the greatest professional experience of my life and I will always be sad that it failed, but I felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders when I decided to shut the company down."," I think the two biggest mistakes I made with Graphite were focusing on the wrong market and shipping without validation. I talked a little bit about the wrong market problem, but let me go into a little more detail.  I am good at b2b customer service, account management, and sales. Getting in front of businesses and trying to sell Graphite was never a problem. I managed to get in front of CNN, Buzzfeed, high-profile NGOs, law firms, and medical clinics. So, the problem wasn’t in generating leads. It was entirely in not understanding the product’s fit within the market I was trying to sell to. Businesses don’t want individual ownership of documents and files. They don’t want absolute control of user accounts in the hands of employees. I tried to fit Graphite into their box, but it was never a good fit. The encryption and protections were always the main selling points, but those benefits were tightly coupled with the things businesses didn’t want. Top that off with the complexity I mentioned earlier, and the b2b path was just flat-out the wrong approach. A quick anecdote to the complexity:  I had done a product demo for an NGO. Most of the staff was on the call, and the goal of the call was onboarding them to a pilot that would eventually convert into my first big paying customer. As part of the onboarding, my goal was to walk them through all the enterprise-specific features they’d be getting that the free accounts didn’t have. We never made it that far. It took 45 minutes for a single person in the organization to create a user account and understand how to manage that account. That experience was the beginning of the end for me.  The second challenge that I think I was able to overcome, but probably too late, was shipping without validation. I first built Graphite as a Google Docs alternative, but I soon convinced myself that it should be a full office suite. I built a terrible spreadsheet app, a file storage app, a Google Forms alternative, and even started on a slideshow app. Build all of these various apps and packaging them into the Graphite offering was distracting. I didn’t focus on my existing users as much as I should have, and I wasn’t able to improve the core product—the documents—fast enough because I was always building and shipping some unvalidated features or product.  I reigned this in, but it was probably too late by then. There’s actually a branch in the Graphite GitHub that was going to be the next generation of Graphite where it was only a documents app again. But as it stands, the final product that users saw was documents and file storage.  I was fortunate that Graphite’s overhead was very low (I sunk almost every dollar of grant money into marketing expenses, not infrastructure), so these mistakes didn’t cost me money. They cost me something more, though. Opportunity.  ‍",,,," I built Graphite WHILE learning to code. It was a strange, non-traditional process. I had tried to learn to code so many times over the preceding 10 years, but I could never focus enough to absorb everything I needed to. With Graphite, I had a goal. So I’d build, I’d get stuck, I’d learn something new, and I’d apply it.  Computer Science majors and programming purists are going to cringe at this next part. I built Graphite in React without even having a good grasp on vanilla JavaScript at the time. The way I figured it, React had so much community support, I could find answers to my problems quickly and ship something that...worked. Didn’t matter to me if the code was shit. I could fix that later. So, I built Graphite as a completely client-side only JAMStack app. All network requests and storage requests were funneled through blockchain protocols and storage backends selected by users.  Every single day was a challenge. I felt like such an imposter building this thing. Who was I to fire up a code editor and program anything? But as I got over the imposter syndrome, the actual coding obstacles became fun. Every bug, every piece of code I didn’t understand became a fun learning process.  I think my first line of code for Graphite was written somewhere around May of 2017, maybe earlier. I was an idiot and never put it under source control until December of 2017. But you can see my first commit here.  When I was finally convinced to launch Graphite to the public, I had the great fortune of also being invited to speak about my experience at a blockchain-focused conference in Berlin. I figured I’d just go ahead and launch the app publicly then. So in March of 2018, I threw together a quick Product Hunt post and went to sleep thinking I’d put more effort in when I woke up. But the truth is, I was so nervous about speaking that day at the event that I didn’t want to think about Product Hunt or launching or anything other than not throwing up. So I pulled the trigger, put it up on Product Hunt, and decided last minute to drop it on Hacker News. Well, that strategy (or lack thereof) worked.  Graphite finished as the number four product of the day on Product Hunt with over 500 upvotes. It trended on the front page of Hacker News for two straight days. Combine that with the fact that this little blockchain event I was to speak at turned out to be a big media event, and Graphite’s accidental, unplanned launch blew up. Graphite ended up being written about on dozens of sites including Wired, Lifehacker, The Washington Post, The Guardian, and more. ‍ But here’s the thing. That was 100% luck. Don’t let anyone with a similar experience tell you otherwise. Luck happens. It’s just a matter of how you react to the times when luck finds you.  For me, I took the luck that had fallen on my shoulders and did everything I could to capitalize on it, starting with the first iteration of a b2b pricing model. I had already started building a user base, so I needed a way to capture businesses. I added just enough features to separate the free and the paid plan, then I started collecting emails and put a “Request Demo” button on the site. I was doing demos from the office of my day job, trying to sell small businesses on this new technology. And it sort of worked. I landed my first customer on a $19.99/month plan. But I knew $19.99 a month wasn’t going to cut it for long. I tried raising the prices, tried adding features, tried streamlining. All in the name of finding the right balance to serve businesses while letting individuals use the app for free. ",," Graphite was born during my MFA program in Creative Writing. I did not have a real technical background at this point. Sure, I’d worked for tech companies, but my roles have always been customer-facing. So, when I had the idea for Graphite, I didn’t know how to make it happen. But let’s back up. Why did I even want to build Graphite? I’ve always been a writer. My whole life has been filled with writing. It just wasn’t until I was in my 30s that I could afford to invest in a degree that clearly wasn’t going to have a job-related, financial return. But when I was financially secure enough to do it, I jumped at the chance to get my MFA.  As I got closer to the end of my MFA program, I realized my most important writing—short stories, novels, notes, etc—were being stored in Google. Google has not had a great history with privacy. They also have had issues where people would be locked out of their accounts either accidentally or for seemingly arbitrary reasons. I couldn’t bear the thought of one day losing all of my writing. And I was NOT going back to Microsoft Word.  I did some research, but I couldn’t find an alternative to Google Docs where I’d have complete control over my documents and couldn’t be locked out. So I said, fuck it. I’ll build it.  I taught myself to code with the singular focus on bringing this thing to life. I made life even harder by deciding to use cutting edge technology that would allow me to realize my requirements of censorship resistance and true user-ownership. There was a steep learning curve not only in learning to code but in diving deep into blockchain and cryptography. But I was motivated. And interestingly enough, the motivation was not around launching a business. It was about building this thing for me.  In fact, when I was ready to launch Graphite, I didn’t. I hosted it for myself only. But when some people I know in the blockchain space found out about it, they encouraged me to make it available to everyone. So, I did.  ‍"," If I were starting all over, I would have focused on the consumer market. Specifically, I would have leaned into the community that already loved Graphite—the blockchain community. I think there was a business to be had there, but I ignored it. It didn’t help that I started Graphite at a time when I was reading more and more about how consumer-facing businesses couldn’t be successful, and b2b was the only path to revenue.  With the consumer model comes differences in how you build a product. I would have focused entirely on the documents component for Graphite, done more user research, and built based on feedback not gut opinions.  But most importantly, I would have realigned my thoughts around building a business. I didn’t have a business as much as I had an app. I would make the guiding principle behind Graphite getting it from app to business.  Things may not have ended up differently if I did the above, but at least I would have new lessons to learn and apply next time. To me, that’s what this whole experience is—a series of lessons that can be applied going forward. I’ve already applied many of the lessons I learned from Graphite.   ‍"," I leveraged my writing skills as my primary marketing strategy. I wrote so many blog posts I can’t even count them anymore. I started the company blog on Medium knowing there was a built-in audience and a better chance to get eyes on my content, but after a while, I moved the blog to a dedicated site owned by Graphite.  With content comes promotion, and I happened to already be pretty into Twitter. So, I used Twitter as my main distribution channel. But I took a different tact with Twitter than most. I chose to be genuine, both with the brand account and my personal account. I tried to avoid corporate-speak, tried to avoid making people feel like they were interacting with a robot instead of a person. What does that look like? Well, it looks like it would if you were tweeting something off the cuff on your personal account with no hidden agenda. And the truth is, that’s how I treated marketing with Graphite. I didn’t subscribe to any social media automation software, I didn’t have a spreadsheet with all my planned tweets laid out. I just did what I always did—tweet when I felt like it. The trick to this, of course, is still tweeting often. But that was never a problem for me.  The other main strategy I had was event marketing. After seeing how much traction I got off that first event in Berlin, I was convinced that attending conferences and speaking or exhibiting was the key to winning business. I managed to get a few speaking events booked where much of my travel and other costs were covered, but for everything else, I paid...a lot.  I still struggle with understanding whether event marketing worked or not. I managed to get continued media coverage of Graphite because of it, but did that coverage translate to users? I don’t know for sure, and that’s a failure of measurement on my part. I’d go so far as to say the biggest failure in marketing as a whole for Graphite was my lack of measurement. I didn’t A/B test things, wasn’t methodical in understanding the returns on the things I did. This was a product of how I was running the business and perhaps a little bit of ego.  I ran the business the way I wanted it to run, which is totally fine. But my ego told me that I didn’t need to try things that other marketers had tried and proven over the years. If I could go back, I would measure everything. I think it’s possible to do that while maintaining a genuine voice and presence.  Honestly, had I been measuring my efforts, I would have recognized patterns earlier. I would have seen that the b2b market might not have been the best bet. I can look back now and see that almost all of my engagement across blog posts and social media came from individual users. That’s an important metric to recognize and act on. But I didn’t notice it at the time. Instead, I barrelled down the b2b path without even considering an alternative.  ‍"," My site has most of my previous work listed, my fiction, and articles about anything from tech to parenting. I specifically set my site up with a membership feature so that I wouldn’t have to install Google Analytics or any tracking pixels. So don’t be scared away if you come across a post that requires membership. I experimented with paid membership but made sure all my posts are free because, honestly, who am I to be charging for my content? I’m on Twitter here. I love connecting with other entrepreneurs and people interested in tech, so please don’t hesitate to reach out!  I’m currently contracting, helping other startups both in product development and engineering. I tend to think of myself as a product person who learned how to code to build said products, so that experience makes me versatile. There will likely be another startup for me in the future (SimpleID ran in parallel to Graphite for a number of months, but I have since exited that company), but for now I’m excited to consult and help others."," My favorite entrepreneurial resources are pretty basic: Books, blogs, and Twitter. I’ll list out a few that I’ve found to be helpful over the years: Books: The Mom Test by Rob FitzpatrickStart Small, Stay Small by Rob WallingReWork by Basecamp Blogs/Sites: Indie HackersWIP.ChatSignalvNoise Twitter: Just follow interesting people or use search heavily. I tend to use Twitter as my go-to search tool instead of Google. It is quickly becoming the content repository for entrepreneurship. ‍"," Because Graphite was, for the most part, a client-side only application, the infrastructure costs were extremely low. I was able to host the entire application on Netlify for free because Graphite is open source. I ended up standing up a database for enterprise customers (that never came) in an effort to solve some of the problems I mentioned earlier about how businesses wanted to use Graphite, but that database never stored enough information to cost much.  One expense I hadn’t accounted for was legal costs. I tried to do Graphite “right”. I got a company attorney early on and made sure that the attorney was well-respected and had some blockchain and cryptography experience. That was not cheap. I only had to use the attorney for a few clerical things and it costs me more than $30,000.  The real costs were marketing costs. They were insane. This is because of my focus on attending events. I traveled to Berlin, London, and Oslo for international conferences. I traveled to San Francisco and New York multiple times. I did virtual events. I paid for the exhibitor space. I got tchotchkes. I even experimented with some paid Twitter ads. I’d say after going full-time on Graphite, marketing expenses made up more than half of my expenses. These marketing costs were huge, coming in somewhere close to $60,000. Many events cost upwards of $10,000 just to exhibit, and then you have to factor in travel expenses. What was left after marketing and other expenses went to paying myself to live. These expenses were paid for through the grants I mentioned before. At its peak, Graphite was pulling in $20,000 a month in grant money. The design of the grant program was such, though, that after a while money would be allocated to other applications built on the protocol offering the grants. All told, Graphite received about $130,000 in grants.  ‍",Software & Hardware,Bad Business Model,United States,"October 1, 2020",Justin Hunter,https://www.failory.com/interview/graphite-docs,"['https://polluterofminds.com', 'https://twitter.com/polluterofminds', 'https://simpleid.xyz']",failure,0,,"Justin Hunter had the courage to challenge Google Docs, all because he was scared of losing all his writing saved in the cloud.

86,growsurf," Hi, I’m Kevin Yun, one of the co-founders of GrowSurf. I’m 29 years old, based out of Chicago, USA. GrowSurf is referral software for tech startups. As a founder, I wear a lot of different hats. Primarily, I handle marketing, product/design, front-end development, and everything operations. GrowSurf is a B2B SaaS business. ",," The biggest challenge was just starting in the stage of 0 to 1. So this included everything: marketing, product, development, etc. Not having social proof (having to build that up from scratch), not having a product that solved any customer use-cases (having to rebuild that from the ground up for one year). Everything in this process was a learning experience. So overcoming obstacles just took a lot of time. We would improve marketing and product reactively, digging for improvements at the roots. The biggest mistake was having a generic SaaS product and compromising on the product. This translated to 0 customers for us. ",,  We share all our revenue and core metrics openly at growsurf.com/open. We’re currently around $25k MRR. We just brought on a full-time CMO who can focus on growth.  Our main goal is to reach $1M ARR. We currently have some employee roles that we need to fill and are currently hiring for a Customer Success Manager. ,," We built GrowSurf v1 with quick development tools like Firebase and Heroku. We were able to deploy a working version in a few short months. Because we have experience building web and mobile products, we were able to design and develop everything ourselves. Derek handled backend architecture, and I handled design and front-end. We ran into a ton of issues. Everything from limitations of using Firebase as our main database, to just building a version 1.0 that ended up being pretty useless to users. We took challenges as they came, but during the early days, it was everything from servers crashing and trying to debug on Heroku logs, to battling unexpected costs with Firebase and rewriting code to fit the query-price paradigm. Another challenge very specific to our product is that we are a deeply integrated platform. So we had to build web SDKs (becoming masters of query selectors, DOM manipulation, browser compatibility, anti-fraud, and much much more) and scalable APIs (eventually implemented proper tools like Redis and Kubernetes). GrowSurf v1 was a free product. We launched everywhere we could. Product Hunt, BetaList -- the usual suspects. Like everything else in this stage, it was hard to get attention -- especially in the marketing automation space (e.g, no one likes cold emails in this space). We got initial batches of users, but throughout the whole first year, we never got truly ideal customers. It wasn’t until we rebuilt the product and addressed our issues that we got our first 10 real customers.",," GrowSurf was born after waiting for years for someone else to build it. My co-founder Derek and I had worked on a few web projects together, and that’s when I would search for referral software we could use. But none of the solutions looked like the right fit for what we were thinking of as a plug-and-play platform. Over the years, I would revisit googling referral software (and also look on Quora, Product Hunt, etc). Nothing ever really looked ideal. That’s when Derek and I started building GrowSurf.  The original vision of GrowSurf was to build the best piece of seamless referral software that we could imagine. With our first version of the product, we ended up strayed far away from the original vision with a lot of technical compromises. It took some time to get back to our roots and rebuild the product, but now the business is doing much better with a renewed customer focus. ","  One of the main lessons has been focusing on the customer. That includes the messaging and copy you use on your website and landing pages. Another big lesson is that things take time. Entrepreneurship takes a toll with its rollercoaster ups and downs, but keep on grinding. There was a time when I was listening to a startup podcast where the company had a failed product but they were able to turn things around. At this time we had 0 customers and were about a year into GrowSurf, and all I could think about was how awesome it would be if we could turn things around as they did. The road ahead would be tough ahead, but persistence did pay off.  Building a company is tough. Listening to the anecdotes of other founders is what helped remind me that it’s always tough for everyone as well and there’s no such thing as a free lunch. Look for the stories where it’s not just butterflies and rainbows. ","  We have done a lot. But to this day, our primary channel is organic search. We are able to show up on Google where prospects are searching for a solution like ours.  Social proof played a huge part. I remember the earlier days when it was incredibly tough because we had no logos, no case studies, no reviews. So building that all up from scratch took a long time. But now that we have some pretty decent social proof, removing that initial friction from buyers has been relieved somewhat.  The one secret to our marketing was constantly improving messaging and positioning. People would ask us what made us different from other referral software. By taking sales calls for the first year (heavily) I was able to pick up what prospects were looking for. Even though we are a self-service product with low LTV where sales don’t make sense, doing sales was crucial.  Understanding how customers spoke unlocked the language that we needed to use to sell. Now our marketing works, but only because the copy speaks to our audience. In our funnel, there are also a lot of areas we could improve in this context.  There was never really one thing that boosted traction. A combination of improving the product, updating messaging, and building up social proof is how we got to where we are today. It’s been such slow progress, but we’ve been investing more into growth recently and are ready for some faster growth. ‍", I write openly about our journey to $1MM at http://open.growsurf.com/. I also share openly on my Twitter.," One recommendation I have is to use a proper database. For example, using Firebase dragged our development output. Even though we built a product pretty quickly, the amount of time-fighting against Firebase overall cost us months in development time. One book I always like to recommend is the Halo Effect. In a nutshell, people like to correlate success with different things, but causation does not equal correlation. So the book does a great job in debunking that myth.

87,growth-cave," Hey Failory! Thanks for having me. My name’s Lucas Lee-Tyson. I’m a 20-year-old college student at Babson College. I’m currently the founder/CEO of Growth Cave, where I help businesses grow online by providing 1:1 consulting and an extensive online training center primarily focused on paid advertising. We work with digital entrepreneurs and marketers to help them acquire new leads and customers with smart Facebook Advertising. ‍",," The start was definitely the hardest. I was extremely close to quitting and just calling this another failed side project during that first month. The biggest struggle for me, as I mentioned before, was selling. I’m naturally a very introverted person and getting on the phone with people (and facing rejection) 5+ times a day was draining at the start. But I am extremely thankful I pushed through it. I feel much more outgoing and articulate (not just on the phone but in real life too) now that I have the practice and have almost no anxiety getting on the phone now. In terms of personal life, there were definitely low points. It’s difficult to wake up early, work on your business, go to your day job, and then come home and work on your own business more. Especially when things aren’t going as you planned. And while I can look back now and see a lot of my hard work paid off, it didn’t always feel that way. There were times where I questioned why I was spending all my free time on this when I was still in college. I should be having fun! Relaxing! I think anyone who builds their own side projects knows the feeling. But ultimately you stick with it for the same reason you started: because you enjoy it. I can say with near 100% certainty that I would not give up being an entrepreneur or a business owner for anything else.  I, like a lot of other entrepreneurial-minded people, suffer from an inability to delegate. I love learning to do everything myself. I taught myself to build and design websites just so I wouldn’t have to hire someone to do it for me. Unfortunately, this mindset is also limiting in a lot of ways. As a business owner now, I feel like I should be focusing on more high-impact areas of my business rather than spending hours tweaking the CSS on my site. Learning how to delegate and properly hire is definitely an obstacle I still need overcome if I want to grow my business. I’ve turned down projects which in retrospect could have been good gigs just because I felt like I didn’t have time for them. But, if I had hired people to take care of certain aspects of my business (mainly campaign management) I could have easily taken them on as clients. Speaking about the marketing ‘guru’ market in general, it is extremely easy to fall into the trap of selling a dream rather than selling a tangible strategy. I’m sure everyone at one point has seen a Facebook or YouTube from Tai Lopez or someone similar, promising to teach them the secret to working for yourself and becoming financially independent. It is a very fine line to walk when it comes to creating an online course in the marketing industry, and I never want to cross over to the ‘dark side’ of it that I’ve seen. ‍",," So like I mentioned, my business model is built on inbound leads, getting people to see me as an ‘expert’ and come to me rather than me chasing after them. My goal is to continue this forward by building a central website outside of Upwork, Growth Cave. I’ve been writing case studies and guest posting like crazy and my goal is to publish a new article every week, either on my own blog or someone else’s as a guest post. My main growth metric is my email subscribers. The more people I have on my email list, the more potential clients and customers I have access to. I’m at about 250 now after about 1 month of starting it and my goal is to hit 1,000 by March 1st. ‍",," So I knew I wanted to do something related to paid advertising. I decided I would try Upwork (despite what a lot of people say about it) since I didn’t know where else to go. I figured with my experience at my internship, combined with some YouTube videos and the resources Facebook and Google provided would be enough knowledge to start. So I got my very first few clients through Upwork. I marketed myself as a PPC (pay-per-click) consultant. Going through a ‘gig’ hiring site like Upwork reduced a lot of my anxiety, as it was a lot easier compared to cold calling people and trying to sell them right away. And while I started out at a paid traffic ‘generalist’, I quickly niched down my services to focus on Facebook Ads, just because 75%+ of the inquiries I had were related to Facebook Ads rather than Google AdWords or others.  It was tough to fit in hours to work on Growth Cave while working my internship. Since I was just getting started (on my business), a large number of my working hours were spent on the phone with prospective clients, trying to determine if we were a good fit. So I was scheduling them during my lunch break, immediately after I got home from work, and even a few before work that had different time zones. It was tough. I actually registered the Growth Cave domain as soon as I had the idea, but never got it set up. For the first 3 months or so, my Upwork profile was literally the only online profile I had related to my work. And even then, I didn’t put as much focus on it as I do now. While in my first month I only made around $400, in my second month I made over $3,000. After I had gained an initial footing and had some positive reviews on my profile, people were inviting me to their jobs rather than having me to apply to them. I was starting to be able to pick and choose who I wanted to work with rather than anyone who would hire me.",," I’ve been in the ‘Internet Marketing space’ since I was 15 years old when I first stumbled on the forum BlackHatWorld. I had always been a nerdy kid and immediately fell in the love with the idea of being able to get rich online building websites. Of course, it wasn’t that simple. I took me 3 months to even make my first dollar online. But after that point, I was hooked. Since then I’ve had a wide variety of Internet-based ‘side hustles’ you could call them. I had an affiliate blog for a while called StreetSumo, which helped people in the streetwear/sneaker space find cheap alternatives to popular trends, which drove over $85,000 in revenue to the Amazon Affiliate program. Last summer, I was working a marketing internship at a tech company that was doing very well. They were spending roughly $250,000/month in paid traffic (AdWords/Facebook) and were paying an agency 8% to manage it. It completely blew my mind that we were paying a company the equivalent of a $240,000 annual salary ($20,000/month * 12). So I started to look into digital agencies and their business models. I had previously tried to start a lead generation agency in my Spring semester of 2018, but failed, mostly due to my complete lack of sales skills. I was terrified of getting on the phone and speaking with clients and it reflected in my wavering tone. That business died in 2 months, after never getting a single client. ‍"," Stop relying on Upwork/referrals earlier. While they’re both great, they are not reliable. If/when I make this full-time I would want to have an extra layer of security rather than ‘hoping’ I get new invites/leads. When I first started out, I was super scared of not doing a good job for clients. I had ‘some’ experience running Facebook Ad campaigns but was terrified of throwing someone else’s money down the drain. But ultimately this was an unfounded fear. My experience in the digital marketing world helped me immensely and I have (thankfully) never had a case of destroying someone’s ad budget. But at the beginning, I didn’t have this confidence, so I guess I would tell myself to be surer of myself given my experience. Another thing I realized is that many clients sometimes don’t just want the amazing results. They want to feel listened to and like their input matters. Sales are half the battle as a freelancer and it is something I wish I could have realized sooner. ‍"," Upwork as a platform is kind of like a mix of LinkedIn and Instagram. They give you a long bio section to introduce yourself, state your expertise, etc. but also a ‘Portfolio’ section where you can showcase relevant work. As I started to do work for clients, I would add their campaign results into the ‘Portfolio’ section. This got amazing results, both for getting more people to contact me and also for more easily closing the sale. No longer was I just talking myself up, the results spoke for themselves. There were some clients who I would immediately get on the phone with and I would never take about myself once. They’d tell me about their business and then ask my rate right away. It was an amazing feeling, to say the least. Additionally, I also began to see referrals start to trickle in. Business owners would tell their friends/family who also had businesses and I had a few clients come in that way. To date, I have never landed a client from cold calling/cold emailing, but I’m much happier with my current system, as well as the one I’m building through partnerships. Essentially, the strategy is to find businesses or personalities who have audiences I think would be a good fit (the marketing industry, mainly) and providing some sort of content for them. This could be in the form of a guest post on their blog, being on their podcast, doing a live workshop/webinar with them, etc. I only just started this system in late December and so far it is has been going great. ‍", You can join my newsletter and read most of my content on Growth Cave.

88,growthmentor," I'm what you would call a 'third culture kid.' I was born in America, but my parents are Greeks. At three years old we moved to Greece. Two years later I moved back to America as a 5-year-old, not knowing any English. At 15, after I had forgotten most of my Greek, we moved back to Greece. But one thing that’s been a constant throughout all that madness was my exposure to entrepreneurship. My Dad was a pretty badass commercial real estate developer in Florida in the 80’s and 90’s. So as a 10 year old I remember spending my afternoons helping out at my his construction sites and the father-son chats we’d have on the way back home where I’d get to learn about the nuances between cost per square foot, utilization rates, and negotiation tactics he’d use to hustle vendors to get the lowest rates on construction material.  Fast forward two decades and I’m now 33 years old and an entrepreneur myself! I’m currently working on building a community called GrowthMentor. GrowthMentor is a 2-sided platform that gives entrepreneurs and marketers the ability to connect with amazing growth mentors for calls on Skype. All of the mentors on the platform go through an intense vetting process. We guarantee that they’ve got the track-record to back-up their claims, and also that they have the soft-skills required to be exceptional mentors. Entrance to the platform costs $99 per year, but this includes 5 hours of free mentorship calls and a bunch of other goodies. All growth mentors are required to have completed at least three mentor sessions at zero cost before they can charge for their time.  ",," The biggest challenge is figuring out a way to educate founders and marketers that there’s a whole new way that they can learn hard stuff. And that’s the peer to peer way. For example yesterday I couldn’t for the life of me figure out how to properly set up cross domain tracking on Google Tag Manager. So I jumped on a 15 minute Skype call with Max Corbeau, a growth mentor who specializes in analytics. He walked me through it on a Skype screenshare and within 3 minutes my problem was solved. If it wasn’t for him, I’d probably hire some freelancer to fix it for me and lose out on that opportunity to learn something new. Busy/successful people don’t have time to read hours of blog posts and watch online courses. Either they know how to do it, or they hire someone who can do it for them. Their time is too valuable to waste. Communicating succinctly that there’s a middle ground option is my biggest challenge so far in the realm of product marketing, but we’re getting there! In terms of the chicken vs. egg dilemma, I’d say the biggest challenge is demand side acquisition. The first month was easy, just post on Facebook Groups and communities and shout some stuff on LinkedIn. But after the low lying fruits are eaten, you need to become more sophisticated and choose your weapon of choice. Outbound? Inbound? PPC? Referral? I used to think, “I’ll just do them all!” but OMG, that does not work when you’re a team of two people working this alongside another full time job! Ideating, executing, and tracking results of growth experiments is relatively straight-forward, but for me, what’s most challenging is managing the pressure of taking corrective action based on the data. There’s a million directions you can take, and as growth lead, you have to make the tough calls. My biggest obstacle is controlling my FOMO. There’s always going to be that annoying little voice in the back of your head telling you that you’re missing out on huge opportunities by not doing that “new cool thing.” 99% of the time that voice is just talking shit. Ignore it.  ‍  My greatest disadvantage is that I don’t know Ruby on Rails, I’m a non-technical founder. I can’t just jump into the code and fix things. Anything that needs to be done like bug fixes or new features has a significant cash cost. And as a bootstrapped founder, this can get a bit demoralizing. To know that you have the design and spec sheet ready for <insert here killer feature>  but you just can’t afford it. I guess that’s life though :)  But on the flip side, being a non-technical founder also can have it’s advantages. You end up being much more deliberate with product development and rely on a lot of user testing and data to justify all your decisions. At the end of the day, you’re paying for it out of pocket, and building silly features that don’t move the needle stings. It also puts the fire on your ass to make more money. Nobody is going to come and save you, you have to save yourself. You want to build that new feature? Figure out a way to sell 100 new subscriptions!  In hindsight, my worst mistake was probably flying the team out to San Francisco for the StartupGrind conference. It’s not cheap to fly 4 people to San Francisco for a week, but the worst part was that I had to miss one of my best friend’s wedding to attend it. Sure, we got some great photos and made some solid connections, but overall was it worth it? I guess time will tell. On the flip side, I got the chance to see first hand how unattractive  the whole groveling for VC money scene is. I don’t know if I’d be so strongly footed in the #bootstrapped camp as I am now if I hadn’t seen that with my own two eyes.  ‍",," In December 2018, we added the ability for mentors to set their rate to free. Our hypothesis was that it would act as a catalyst to spur platform engagement. It worked. Since growth mentors legit enjoy helping, they had no problem offering a couple hours per month for free to mentor bootstrapped startups. This completely demolished the barriers to “aha” moment for mentees leading to hockey stick growth in session bookings which led to hockey stick growth in reviews and social proof.  We didn’t make any money from that spike in usage since the price was zero. But in those first pre-traction moments, optimizing for learning and getting that social proof from early adopters is more important than making a quick buck. Think, we can now turn around and leverage that social proof in our marketing to increase reach and conversion rates. Which is exactly what we did! After two months we hit the +500 booked session milestone and we decided it was time to monetize. We decided to put up a $99/year paywall for access to the platform. All early adopters were grandfathered in free for life. Our goal is now to raise money through selling subscriptions so that we can continue product development. ",," I registered the domain name GrowthMentor.io on June 18th, 2017 but didn’t start actually working on the idea till October of that year. My wife teaches English online via this platform called Italki, so I kind of knew that I wanted to take a similar approach from a product perspective since I had seen it work first hand for years.  The first iteration of GrowthMentor was a simple landing page I put up to validate the idea. I used a Twitter bootstrap template to hack together a landing page then drove $500 worth of Adwords traffic to it bidding on the keyword “find business mentor” I  had a ±18% conversion rate with an average CPC of $2 and managed to score 40 leads. Of which I got on the phone with 10 of them for customer development interviews. I used a simple Typeform to profile those initial users and extract as much qualitative data as possible into the pain points of growth. I isolated that loneliness was a major pain point common to all early respondents. And it’s only superficially being solved and also exacerbated by social media. It’s a pain point that was integral to my own motivations for jumping on those Skype calls with the Upwork contractors, so I explored the underlying causes in more depth. What I found was that people in growth have very specific stressors which are hard to relate to if you’re not also in growth.  After roughly three months of customer development and fine tuning our positioning strategy, it was time to start building. Wireframing and then prototyping took around a month. We started sketching every screen out by hand, and then transitioned to Google Docs. After each screen was laid out in Google Docs, Alek Manov turned them into high fidelity designs which we iterated on for a month via InvisionApp. By mid-March, we were ready to start development.  We outsourced the development to Ragnarson who specializes on Ruby on Rails web apps. We were well prepared with clickable prototypes on InvisionApp that 1:1 mirrored all of the functionality of the final build. This dramatically reduced the total build time. Development officially started on April and 6 months later we launched the public beta with more features than we really needed. We knew we could have gone a bit lighter on the build-spec, but thought our target audience was very web savvy and had higher expectations than your traditional B2C customer personas.  If we were going to do this, we were going to do it properly. Not going to reveal exact build cost, but it was around the cost of a brand new BMW sedan. We ran out of runway (aka my savings) a month after we launched and the funding of the continued development comes from my day job’s income, exciting times for sure :) Minimum delightful product > Minimum viable product We didn’t make a big fuss about the platform pre-launch, no pre-launch promotions or anything like that. I’m a big fan of shadow launches because they give you buffer to fix things before the spotlight is on you. We did do a targeted 1:1 outreach campaign for mentors so we could launch with a decent quantity already onboard. I think we had like 15 mentors on the platform the day we launched the public beta. ",," After completing my IB exams in high school I decided to keep scratching that entrepreneurial itch by studying business at CASS Business School in London where I majored in finance. Honestly, University was a bit of a blur, but I do remember realizing early on that I wasn’t a fan of the big financial institutions. I could never reconcile fiat currencies and the total ridiculousness of wealth inequality. We can print money out of thin air and create trillions in bullshit derivatives, yet 2 billion people don’t have access to clean drinking water. Right… Never ended up using that Finance degree in a career kind of way, but those courses in stats were super useful when it came time to setting up statistically significant A/B tests a few years down the road.  After University I ended up heading growth at EuroVPS, a managed hosting provider, as their first marketing hire. With zero experience in digital marketing and a team that consisted of mostly engineers, I ended up having to fake it till I made it and learned everything by myself through trial and error. I made every noob mistake in the book. From forgetting to set 301 redirects after a site relaunch, to using broad match keywords in Adwords without a single negative keyword. I’ve screwed up more ways than most people would ever financially afford to screw up.   I spent countless hours reading blog posts and taking Udemy courses on new areas I wanted to improve in. While I learned a lot, I noticed my productivity was inversely correlated to how much stuff I learned. The more time I spent learning things, the less time I had to actually get things done. There had to be a better way to learn and stay competitively productive concurrently.  That’s when the idea hit me.  This was the breakthrough move I made that ultimately planted the seed for the birth of GrowthMentor.  Instead of watching courses made by some random person who knows nothing about my business, why don’t I hack together my own real life courses custom tailored to my point-in-time situation?  To do this I’d create job postings on Upwork such as: “60 minutes Skype call with Facebook Ads expert,” and do screen shares with freelance subject-matter expertise and learn directly from them in a field environment. I was shocked at how much faster I learned this way. I was breaking through plateaus left and right. If anything seemed difficult or out of reach to learn I’d simply create a job posting on Upwork and get on a call with an expert. I’d make sure to do my homework and due diligence before the call as to be prepared with structured questions. I’d even record my screen so I could play it back later. This way I could focus 100% without having to take notes.  This was how the idea originated. I figured, “I’m just a typical person who has typical problems,” so if this works for me, it’ll probably work for other people too! ‍"," If I could talk to my former self before GrowthMentor I’d tell him to not stress out so much. Everything’s going to work out. Spend more time in the sun, play more basketball, take those Sundays off and just hangout and stuff.   I’d also tell him to completely scratch those “at scale” outbound campaigns I had planned but never actually executed. That was such a waste of time. Let’s be honest, how long does it take to send five super personalized and high-impact emails per day? Maybe an hour on day 1, but as time passes, you’ll get faster and faster since you will be building up a big repo of templates, by month two you’ll probably be able to do 10 per day. That’s 300 emails per month to hyper relevant people that can become strategic partners and who knows, maybe even friends down the road! I know that outbound at scale has its place, I’m actually planning a few campaigns now, but at that early stage, it just wasn’t a good fit. It’s something I wish I knew earlier on. ‍"," The first two weeks after we launched we did absolutely zero promotion. We focused exclusively on 1:1 outreach to get more mentors onboard, targeting growth people we personally admired and that we believed had the right ethos fit. Once we had around 30 mentors, we decided to tippy toe into the limelight a little more. Our first “public” appearance came via a post on the SaaS Growth Hacks Facebook group where I told the story of the platform and asked if people resonated with it. I was blown away by the positive response. We must have got more than 100 signups from that single post.  Since we’re bootstrapped, we exhausted all free marketing channels first. That meant mingling in niche communities like IndieHackers, GrowthHackers and a variety of Slack channels. This was a go-go-go time period where we didn’t get to sleep that much. LinkedIn worked really well too. I’m not really a big social media user but I knew that if I was going to play the role of a founder of a marketing platform, I had to up my game. We also did a lot of blog posting writing dozens of blog posts those first few months. A few of those posts are starting to rank for some pretty serious keywords, but as we all know, SEO is a long game. My biggest regret is that I didn’t promote those early posts enough. It was one of those cases where I “knew” I should do it and I even made a pretty sweet checklist for it, but I just ran out of steam...  We spread ourselves way too thin those early days. I should have delegated the promotion to my VA instead of all the list building I had them do. At one point I went on a massive targeted scraping campaign with the big picture to send out semi-personalized (at scale) email drips to drum up demand. I only ended up using like 2 or 3 of those lists. It takes a lot of time to do outreach at scale properly, and if you’re managing operations, creating content, and also juggling a day job, it’s like the first thing to cut from the “to-do” list. Anything done at scale carries the potential risk to tarnish your brand if executed improperly.  Doing things that didn’t scale like cultivating 1:1 friendships with the mentors and mentees was our most successful marketing strategy. Unlike other B2C 2-sided marketplaces like Airbnb where the supply side is just normal people trying to make some side cash, our supply was bad-ass growth marketers that legit wanted to help people grow. Many of them are deeply entrenched in the startup scene with huge networks. So leveraging their networks was kind of a no-brainer for us. We didn’t want to create a “marketplace,” we wanted this to be a community.  We started with private Facebook groups, one for the mentors first, then a few months later, one just for the mentees. It turned out to be a great place we could ask for feedback from super smart growth peeps, share our progress, and where members could network with each other.  ‍", You can follow me on my Twitter profile here.," Shameless plug, visit GrowthMentor and book a call with a growth mentor.

89,gulp," Hey! I’m Jeff Orr, a 24-year-old product designer, and entrepreneur based in San Francisco. These days I help founders go from idea to launch at MVPDevelopment. This is the story of Gulp - an app started by two friends in college to pay bar cover. I joined as a founding team member focused on marketing and user growth.  The idea was simple - rather than having to go to an ATM to pull out cash to pay for entrance to the bar, you could use Gulp (which added a $.99 convenience fee) to pay digitally. In a town of 30,000 students (most of them bar-goers) the idea seemed like a no-brainer... ‍"," The unit economics didn’t work (see above) and our value proposition wasn’t strong enough to change an existing behavior. Aside from the marginal transaction fees, we had no other way of monetizing other than ads, which (1) we had no idea how to implement (ie. sell placements), and (2) we had no money to implement. It was one of those long drawn out failures where you deny that you’re failing for several months. You just sit there and feel stuck & miserable for months on end, rather than chalking it up as an L. As an entrepreneur, you’re told never to give up, while simultaneously being told failure is ‘good’ (but it feels horrible in the moment). So you freeze up. It’s hard to identify and execute new ideas in that mindset - and as the adage goes: startups don’t fail when they run out of money, but when they run out of new ideas.  And so, the hard decision was made to move on. Shutting down a company is never a fun experience. However, the team learned a ton, got great opportunities, and every one of the founding team members went on to start bigger and better things based on the lessons learned from Gulp."," As the app started to pick up steam, we started getting emails saying door guys weren’t accepting their covers. So we went to the door guys to ask why, and they were very candid in saying it’s a pain in the ass to pull out their phone, find their own app, and scan drunk people’s phones. So it was back to the drawing board. Ultimately, we determined that a user wouldn’t redeem a cover on purpose without getting an entry in return. So we created a button you would hold for 3 seconds, a yellow bar would fill behind the button over the course of those 3 seconds, and then the cover would vanish. Users would simply redeem the cover in front of a door guy for entry. Problem solved! ",,,," Since our founding team was non-technical, we hired a recent graduate as our developer for $150/hour. This guy built the Newsy app, which sold for ~$30M, so we knew he was legit. All in, the app cost around $15K, which at the time was all of our savings and then some. The app was built in around 2 months.  One of the big UX challenges we had to figure out was determining how users would buy and redeem covers. In the beginning, we decided that users would buy “digital covers” which had a QR code that doormen could scan at the door using their phone. This method worked well enough for launch, so we did it. ‍ For the launch, we convinced 2 of the 10 bar owners to accept our digital covers to test the viability of our app. We told some friends the app would be available on a Monday night, we spent $75 on Facebook ads announcing the app would be available, and we tweeted to our 250 followers that we attracted by word of mouth. The app was not approved by the App Store until that afternoon. Just in time! ‍ We showed up early, grabbed a booth and some drinks, and waited for the crowds of people to show up to use our new app. Only 25 people had downloaded at this point, but I guess we expected people to download it on their way to the bars. No surprise now - they did not. It was just us and a few friends.",," We were 19, 20, and 20 at the time. Since we were all in university, we had a lot of time on our hands. The idea was a classic example of scratching your own itch.  This was an SEC school, so there were about 30,000 students and a good proportion of them partied a lot. There were 10 major bars downtown and on any night of the week, you could find one that was packed. In order to enter the bar, you typically had to pay $5 to $10 in cash at the door, referred to as “the cover.” Usually, that was the bar’s profit, and there were drink specials sold at cost.  If you didn’t have cash, you’d have to go to an ATM - which meant getting hit with a withdrawal fee (plus the annoyance of losing your spot in line). After experiencing this pain ourselves and witnessing countless others, we figured people would appreciate a cashless alternative. "," Hindsight is 20/20, and I’ve been lucky to work with dozens of other entrepreneurs through mvpdevelopment.io, so looking back here’s one idea... At the time, I had no idea what affiliate marketing was, or how referral agreements were structured. What would businesses pay for a customer referral? We should have implemented some combination thereof to gamify our app. Users redeem points for covers, and points could be collected in a number of ways: Eating at a particular local restaurant. Getting your haircut at a particular salon. We could have partnered with those businesses and earned money for every customer we sent their way.Cost-Per-Action offers (CPA offers affiliate marketing). Students take surveys in the in-app browser while in class. We get paid as those surveys are completed.Online deal redemption (Cost per Acquisition offers affiliate marketing). Using incentives (the points) to get students to buy products online or sign up for services. Just like those old ‘free xbox’ websites that made you complete a million different offers - but not as obnoxious. Point economics would be structured such that we make 3x or 4x the actual cost of a cover. That way, bars charge us $5/cover but we make $15 to $20 as a student collects enough points to buy a cover. This solves profit and value proposition issues, but there are a few more benefits: User acquisition costs become nearly non-existent, as the value proposition is much stronger (free covers), and people refer friends to earn points (which cost us $.25 to $.33 on the dollar).We gain leverage in the marketplace. Bars charge us $5/cover in the beginning, but the power dynamic changes when we can control the crowds by (a) advertising or not advertising their deals, and (b) raising or lowering the # of points it costs to buy cover at one bar over another. Lower payment processing expense, and higher margin on cash cover purchases. Who knows if this would work, but the point is that we should have found better ways to leverage the marketplace of users and bar owners AND figured out unit economics early before running out of cash. "," The team and bar owners were happy that the app had worked for a few people, but it definitely was not the explosive launch we were hoping for. On the bright side, the people who did use it had a smooth experience. We learned from this that “if you build it they will come” is generally not true. So we implemented a few strategies to market our app: We ran a follow/unfollow twitter bot on our account targeting everyone who followed the accounts of the major bars in our college town. Twitter is where everyone found out about drink specials.  A couple of student journalists heard about us, asked to interview us, then published our interviews with links to download our app.  We went to fraternities and sororities at dinner time. At our school, it was common for people to drop by and pitch in one minute their event or org. We went and pitched our app and left flyers. We worked out deals with one of our partner bars so that people who paid cover with our app would get crazy good drink deals. We had to pay the difference in the drink price, but we only further discounted already good deals ($3 pitchers -> $1 pitchers). This created lines around the block. We ‘hired’ unpaid interns to hand out flyers in front of the bars. We were getting users for about $1/each blended. In one month, we acquired 2,500 users - about 25% of the bar-going crowd. We even had some haters (which typically means you’re doing something right). "," Pretty much everything about me online can be found on my website, my recent projects live at WeBuildYourApps and I occasionally write on Medium. Reach me directly at jeff@maplyapp.com!"," I love books about grit and stories of people going from nothing to something. Some of my favorites: How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia - Mohsin Hamid (it’s fiction, but still great)Over the Edge of the World - Laurence BergreenShoe Dog - Phil KnightAmerican Kingpin - Nick BiltonThe Everything Store - Brad Stone "," Processing these $5 covers cost us $.47 each time. We bore that expense because bars were already hesitant to reduce the amount of cold hard cash they brought in. Plus, customers' ability to pay cover by credit card wasn’t a benefit strong enough to attract customers to one bar over another. We charged $5.99, and people knew they were paying an extra $.99 for convenience. A $1 convenience fee was better than $3 at the ATM, and walking to an ATM. Still, we were making just $.52 per cover, and users weren’t sticking. We processed $10,000 in cover purchases and averaged less than 1 purchase per user. $.52 per use, $1.50 to acquire a user, $15,000 to build the app, and we were out of money (in debt to our parents, even).

90,gymlisted," Hey, I’m Tom! I’m a software developer from Toronto, Canada. Back in early 2017, I partnered up with a friend of mine to start a startup that ultimately failed called Gymlisted. I’m happy to tell our story! These days, I’m building and growing an automatic transcription platform called Vocalmatic. I definitely took the lessons from Gymlisted and learned what not to do! ‍"," The biggest cause of Gymlisted’s failure was that there was pretty much no demand for what it had to offer. Private gyms already rely on various other channels for marketing, such as social media, and plenty of gym owners saw no need for membership management and payment processing to be online.  After doing some basic competitor analysis, we saw that there were well established companies in the space (even one that is publicly traded!). Being inexperienced with sales and going up against behemoths, coupled with building something that no one really wanted, led to the ultimate demise of Gymlisted. We also tried to pivot towards building Gymlisted into a place for personal trainers to find a gym they can take their clients to, but at that point, we were feeling a little burned out and lost interest in the idea. We killed our own startup! ‍"," The biggest challenge was selling to and convincing private gym owners that they needed yet another way to process payments and manage memberships. We made the huge mistake of not validating early on the base idea behind Gymlisted. We did not position ourselves as the provider of a service that could solve our target customer’s problem while also being something that those potential customers would want. An obstacle we were constantly faced with was very rarely getting a gym owner to get us to come in and showcase the website. It was after the idea of starting a tangential service to for private gym owners and offering it for free that they started really responding to us, even inviting us in to their gym to offer or free service.",,,," Every day I would come home from my day job and code up features for Gymlisted until midnight. The tech stack was Python, Flask, and Postgresql on the backend, with jQuery and Bootstrap on the frontend. For the developers out there, you’ll find that it’s really easy to build a Flask application that has all the models and views in one file. This time, I challenged myself to better structure a Flask application. I ended up taking inspirations from Laravel, using Flask Blueprints, defining models separately from views, etc.  To get a working website up, it took around a month and a half of coding evening and weekends. At that point, we had the following features available: Search by city/location. This was powered by PostGIS (an amazing library!)Gym listing page, with the ability to add descriptions, services at the gym, and photosMembership management and purchasing - payments powered by StripeMessaging system ‍ In hindsight, it was way over developed to be a “basic” application. The biggest lesson I learned is that it’s important to get real validation before building the next feature. But being a developer, it’s really easy to get caught up in assuming you know what users want and escaping to our comfort zones: a text editor and terminals ) As for our business model, it was similar to payment processors where we take a percentage of each gym membership payment transaction made between the gym and the client.",," Gymlisted was supposed to be the place for finding the right private gym. It was also the place where you could purchase and manage your memberships online. The idea came about when I decided to build something to help my cousin, who owns a private gym, get more clients and manage memberships online. Since he was into the idea and wanted to try it out when it was built, I assumed (mistake #1!) other private gym owners would be on board as well. I reached out to a friend of mine from high school and we decided to work on Gymlisted together - I would take care of the programming and he would take care of outreach. ‍"," Definitely, speak to more potential users before building out a full-on platform. I would also figure out right from the get-go if what I was building would be something that people pay for. I think this approach would have led to failing much earlier and allowing me to move on to the next idea! Another approach that I would have taken is from the book Traction, which I mention below. Basically, you spend 50% of your time on product development and 50% of your time on marketing. A good balance of both will get you to where you want - either the next success milestone or knowing that your product isn’t well received by the market. ‍  Here’s what I thought about and learned during the 8 months spent building Gymlisted: 1) You should build the simplest version of your idea and validate early on - We mistakenly thought that getting the “okay” from one person meant that was enough to justify building out a full-on website/product. If I coded up a simple website with the basic functionality first and then use that to validate the idea first, we could have saved ourselves a lot of time knowing if it will work or not! 2) See if there are customers already paying for a similar offering - If there are other products out there that are similar to yours, that is a great sign. It shows that there is a market for what you are thinking of building. The key is finding out how you can bring it to market and if it’s possible given your resources, such as time, capital, and skillset. 3) Know when to cut your losses - We spent 8 months building and trying to promote Gymlisted. We shouldn’t have let ourselves get blinded by the idea, and thought more if what we were working on was a failure. 4) Understand that failing is all part of the process - Coming to terms with a project failing definitely sucked, but it did teach me that all the failures were just lessons for how not to do things in the future! ‍"," Since we never got any customers, I’ll go over some of the strategies we attempted. 1) Cold Emailing - The most effective strategy for us to get at least a response was direct outreach. This was mostly a simple response back such as a hello or offering their own service. Plenty of gym owners have a website and their contact information was present on the site. We simply pitched our ideas to owners via email. Another thing we did was message gym owners through contact forms on their website. That also got us a few responses! 2) Social Media - Using Twitter’s search feature, we searched for terms such as “where to find a gym” and “find gyms in <area>”. The idea behind using Twitter was to help users by responding to their tweets. Plenty of people tweet asking for help but sometimes no one responds to their tweets. We saw that as an opportunity to get the attention of someone who might be interested in checkout out Gymlisted. Our Twitter account is still available online for posterity’s sake! 3) Offering a tangential service for free - In addition to the cold emailing and direct outreach, we decided that to get the attention of gym owners, we could offer a free service. So, I decided to buy a 360 Camera and offer free 360 photos and videos to the gym owners so they could use it on Gymlisted and anywhere else online. A few gyms bit, but overall it wasn’t a popular option. ‍", You should definitely check out my: Personal WebsitePersonal BlogVocalmatic WebsiteTwitter ," I'm a big fan of books!

Mine is both in a small niche that has little to no case studies, and is targeting very specific segments of users.  Finding the right channel is the result of intensive experimenting and analyzing results, so as you can guess, it’s a matter of balancing your spent bucks with the ROI. Sometimes the ROI was unclear, but I had to reach my pocket anyway because the insight from my customer survey said so. Sometimes the ROI was a little bit clearer, but long-term, so I had to battle the impatience in seeing my dollars going away without almost nothing in return.  I think my solution at that time was to stop doing everything, and rethink about my long-term goal for the product. That helped me prioritize which experiments would be run first, and what I should expect out of it. While I’m betting on some short-term tactics which burn a lot of cash, I’m still backing up the plan with investment in long-term solutions in case things don’t go my way.  My mom is a typical Asian mom, who values dinner together and more “traditional” jobs at state-owned companies. Seeing me going heads over heels about this startup made her worried and she couldn’t stop complaining to me and asking me why I’m so late for dinner every time. The family pressure was rising every day when I started working on Saturday once in a while (which is abnormal here in Vietnam) and when I become more stressful with unsuccessful campaigns.  I decided to have a heart-to-heart talk with her and started explaining every bit of my job in mom’s language so she could somehow understand what I am doing and how important the role is to the company. Things got quiet down, but I know, deep down inside, she’s still worried. But now at least she doesn’t exert pressure on me every late dinner.    I think the greatest disadvantage of Habitify team is market understanding. We’re targeting Japan and the US, the two largest economies in the world with completely different cultures and social norms. When we were launching campaigns, there was a part deep inside that keeps wheezing because we are not completely confident about offering the “right” thing for our customers. I also see that this disadvantage kept us from innovating the product and being robust in our marketing. Our worst mistakes were to invest in short-term growth hack tactics, to which I think the lack of market understanding attributes largely. Instead of building sustainable foundations, we spent too much time expecting quick results and crying over spilled milk. Admittedly it was me who was obsessed with some quick numbers that I did everything at the disposal of the company’s brand. This did cost me a huge load of money, but more than that, it was the loss of time and the damaged brand that have a more profound effect.  ‍",," Our goal is to make Habitify the best multi-platform Habit Tracker. To be more specific, when people need a habit tracker that is minimal and straight-forward, they have to think about us first. We believe profit is just the subsequence of this. We don’t have any fixed numeric number to strive for, but we’re looking to grow the revenue to the point that it can sustain other apps we’re developing as well. To maintain and grow Habitify, more employees will need to be hired, and that’s what we’re going to do this year 2020. Building a strong, collaborative team is the key result for the aforementioned objective. We are pushing for a more polished presence for the Habitify brand: more designers, a UX/UI specialist to make the app and all websites even more enjoyable to use. Also, we are getting in-house testers to make sure the app is as ready as possible before any big updates. ‍ As of now, we are planning for a major shift for Habitify this summer. We are in the brainstorming phase to see what features will really make a big difference in helping people stay on track and reach their goal. So yeah, big changes ahead in 2020 for Habitify.",," I was not present when Habitify was first launched, but a year later. Nevertheless, I felt like I had witnessed a baby’s growth since birth.  Peter told me that in the first 6 months of Habitify, there were absolutely no sales. People downloaded it, but the app was too primitive to be sales-appealing. There were only 3 people at first: Peter (iOS developer), Dat (Marketing) and Son (Designer). They were living AND working together on the 5th floor of a poor-conditioned flat, with no air-conditioner under the 40-degree heat of Vietnam summer. I came on board to help grow the apps when there was just Peter running the whole operation. We didn’t have an office and had to work in a co-working space everyday for more than 6 months. At that point, we were one of the first habit trackers that strived to be multi-platform.  Mac, iOS and Apple Watch as the the initial trio, then last year we expanded to Android and Web. Our core motto was to make tracking habits as easy as it gets. No matter what device you have on your hand, you can start building your habits. Following this direction, we expanded the team in 2018 and 2019: from 2 people with no office, to almost 20 people working to push Habitify forward. ‍ Pricing strategy is a very interesting story. At first, we only priced the app $2.99 for a lifetime premium, and that’s that. When we started to grow Habitify to more platforms, the costs increased and forced us to change the model. We began to charge each platform separately $10 (iOS, macOS, Android), which led to a problem of premium synchronization. That model was too troublesome for us to maintain, which drove us to our current model: A combination of subscription and lifetime packages. Sometimes I find it hard to believe that we’re stopping at $39.99 for the lifetime version, $29.99 for annual and $4.99 for monthly. People are still purchasing it! And in fact, our revenue has been higher than ever (and it keeps growing)! ",," I’m telling the story of my co-founder, Peter, who started Habitify.  ‍ Peter was an iOS developer who got promoted to project manager only 2 years after he had joined his first company. The salary at that time was attractive and generally higher than most of his peers.  But he was not satisfied. He has always had this dream of exploring life to the fullest, and improving people’s lives with his skills. The offered job might give him financial stability, but it wouldn’t be able to give him what he truly wanted.  So he quit. Spending the next few months at home doing nothing (actually trying to find inspiration for his new business) was quite a rough start. Peter was truly demotivated, now that his mom kept telling him to get out and find something to do (which Asian moms would typically do to their lazy children).  One day, she reached the peak of her anger and said: “You don’t know how to appreciate this life. While you’re slacking off here enjoying all these luxuries, thousands of children in Africa are dying!”  Eureka.  Peter got an idea. He wanted to make an app to help improve the world. That app, he thought initially, must donate a part of its income to children in Africa. And so he set out to do market research and found the niche he’s in right now. That’s how Habitify started - a habit tracker that donates $1 of every purchase to provide water for African children.  ‍"," I would invest in long-term strategies for the company, naming analytics and content.  We refrain ourselves from investing in a well-rounded analytical tool to track user attributes and all the touchpoints they have been through, which later led to our insufficient understanding of our own loyal users.  Regarding content, it’s something I wish I started at the beginning of my journey. Content is more valuable than any lead-generating method I have tried. The LTV of the traffic from content is at least twice as high or even 3 times as that coming from direct store search. In the long-term, evergreen content and still produce tons of traffic without much effort. "," There is no absolute answer for this. I think our app grows from the trial and error of many marketing strategies, including both traditional and unconventional growth hack tactics. One of the first solutions to the sluggish revenue stream was to localize the app and expand it to more markets. Then, we launched Habitify on Product Hunt to gain some traction. There we go, the first purchase after 6 months. The first month of salary for everyone in the team.  Then everything changed when Apple featured us. It was a big hit. Millions of impressions turned into thousands of downloads each day. People started to notice our indie app, and spread the words around. News wrote about us. Apple featured us again. We reached 500,000 downloads in 2 years, and in the next few months from now, it will be 1 million.  On our journey from that critical moment of Apple naming Habitify as New App We Love, we tried a lot of things: from Facebook ads campaign, Instagram story ads campaign and lots of give-away, referral, special campaigns throughout the seasons... Now, the marketing strategies that truly work for us were a strong focus on content marketing and affiliate marketing. One-off events like Product Hunt launches or advertisements were not worth our effort and are incredibly expensive.  We haven’t grown our revenue significantly from our marketing strategies, but we know we’re on the right path. The LTV of traffic coming from our content campaigns far exceeds that from other campaigns, which is a positive signal. So for 2020, content marketing will be one of our key focuses to grow the app in a sustainable way. We are committed to bring not only the best app on the market, but also a blog that delivers the most in-depth articles on habit tracking and goal setting. "," Well, a lot of places to go to: Under the name of Peter, I wrote a few stories about our journey in his Medium account.I also shared some marketing learning on my own bog.Check out Habitify’s Twitter and you’ll see how we engage with our users. Check out our blog page, where we shared the success stories of our own users and the articles that we have been writing our heart. You’ll see a growing focus on content via this channel."," For me, I learned best by joining online and local communities and getting in touch with other founders/indie hackers. Looking at my own project from their perspective gives me a lot of new realizations and ideas that I never could have thought of myself. I would suggest Indie Hackers and Hacker News as great places to start. Some subreddits are also valuable: r/startups, r/entrepreneur, r/business…  I love looking at websites and services of other people. From a marketing perspective, I can always learn something about copywriting, or their marketing strategy. I think this gives me a rough understanding of the world out there, and also tons of new ideas for my product. ‍",,Productivity,,Vietnam,"March 1, 2020",Alan Nguyen,https://www.failory.com/interview/habitify,"['https://medium.com/@petervu1', 'https://tuanmon.com/category/tech-talk/', 'https://twitter.com/Habitifyapp', 'http://habitify.me/blog']",success,1,$10k-$25k/mo,"Peter wasn’t happy with his iOS developer job; he wanted to help people and change the world in some way.

92,habitual," My name is Holger and I’m a designer-turned-engineer from Denmark. I studied design in school, but at the end of my schooling, I realized how hard it was to get programmers to code the things I designed, so I ended up learning to code myself, which is mainly what I do today. I have always been interested in the startup world, which initially led me to work as a designer at a long-forgotten startup in San Francisco. After that, I attended Hacker School (now called Recurse Center), which is akin to a writer’s retreat, but for programmers. During my time at Hacker School, I really went into programming and I ended up working as a front-end programmer for a startup in Denmark. A couple of years later, I co-founded a startup in NY called Slang which was a marketplace for sneakers and streetwear. Our startup ended up sharing the same story as a lot of other startups and after 3 tough years of constant work, dedication, and ups and downs, we had to throw in the towel. Through all that, I’ve always been building smaller projects on the site. They were the best way to keep learning new languages and technologies. This led me to building one of the most popular calculators on the Mac App Store (initially built in Objective-C and later in Rubymotion) and a Solitaire card game website (built with React and other JS-technologies) where people play 3 million games of FreeCell, Spider, and Klondike Solitaire each month. My latest side-project was called Habitual and it was a habit tracker that helped users form great habits, reach their goals, and get their lives in order. This whole interview will be around the origins and shut down of this startup. ‍"," I still haven’t given up totally on Habitual. I use it myself and love it and I have a small crowd of people who are using it as well, so I’ll keep maintaining it. Measuring Habitual’s success in commercial terms, it’s definitely a failure though. The main cause for Habitual’s “failure-to-launch”, was definitely me underestimating the importance of marketing. One reason for that is that my background is not in marketing. Frankly, I really don’t like doing marketing, so I tend to push everything marketing-related to the back of the queue. I think a lot of other programmers feel the same way. Another reason I underestimated marketing so much, can be found in the nature of the other side-projects I’ve made throughout my time as a programmer. One of the very first apps I made was a top-bar calculator for the Mac App Store and the way people tend to find such an app is by searching “calculator” in the Mac App Store. In other words, the way people discover such an app is through search so I don’t have to do much marketing work. Another project I’ve had great success with is Online Solitaire, a website where you can play all the classic solitaire card games such as Klondike, FreeCell, and Spider. Again, the way people find such a site is through search. There’s really no big marketing campaigns one can run for such products. So looking back, even though I had experience in making apps and websites and I’ve had a great number of people using them, I never really had any experience in marketing, which was crucial for an app like Habitual.",,,,," Every app starts with a design, which I did on Sketch. I kind of had an idea in my head of how the design of the app should be. I took a lot of inspiration from Things, which is my absolutely favorite todo-app. That app has a very underplayed design, in the sense that the layout is not sectioned up as much as a lot of other apps and it doesn’t have a lot of different bells and whistles when it comes to the design. It’s straightforward to start using the app for beginners and it has all the complexity needed for power-users. After a lot of iteration, I ended up with something I liked. I build the app in React Native, which was one of the reasons I did the project in the first place. I used Expo as a base since they had over-the-air deliveries (which I absolutely loved) and had libraries for a lot of different base functionality I knew I needed in the app. They were also cross-platform, which meant that I’d have a relatively easy time “converting” the iOS app into an Android app (sadly I never got around to doing that). The monetization strategy was much the same as many other habit trackers. For my app, I decided to allow people to have 3 habits for free. After that, they could start a free trial which would lead them to a subscription for a month, a year, or a one-time purchase for a lifetime subscription. To ease the implementation of subscriptions and purchases I used Revenuecat, which I can highly recommend anyone who’s about to deal with in-app purchases in an iOS or Android app to use. It makes life much easier.",," I started Habitual after reading Atomic Habits by James Clear, a book I can highly recommend to anyone interested in how habits function. This book outlined the psychology behind habits really well and made the path to creating a good one and breaking bad ones really clear to me. Being the programmer I am, the first thing I did was to see if there were any apps out there that could help me apply all these things I learned about in Atomic Habits. I did find a surprisingly big amount of habit trackers out there, but none of them were to my liking. They were either too techy, with lots of graphs, or too flimsy, with big buttons and nice illustrations, but not much overview of how you were doing. I kind of felt like Goldilocks with all these apps, since none of them felt right and I knew that I’d end up not using a non-essential app like this unless it felt right. Thinking back, it was the good old story of a developer scratching his own itch. And I guess it didn’t hurt that I wanted to get into programming in React native. ‍"," I’d find someone to partner up with. I’m definitely not good at marketing and I most likely won’t become good at it, since I don’t enjoy it. So if I’m ever to do a project like this again, finding someone who compliments my skills to do it with, is a must. I’d also think twice about going into a market so crowded as the habit tracker market. At the time I started programming my app, there was already a good deal of habit tracker apps out there. None of them were to my liking, but a lot of other people seemed to use them. So if you’re making a new product in a crowded market, you better make sure your product offers significant advantages over the other ones. ‍"," This is basically where I fell short. Like so many other programmers who do a side-project, I never really gave too much thought into how I’d get the word out there. I think many programmers are under the assumption that if the product is good, it’ll spread by itself. That’s just not the case. The biggest thing I did marketing-wise was posting the app on Product Hunt, where it got a semi-good reception. Partly because I posted it on a Sunday, which doesn’t seem to be the day people are thinking about optimizing their lives, and partly because Product Hunt has been overflowed with different habit trackers.  After launching on Product Hunt, I didn’t really have much of a marketing strategy, so the app was kind of left dead in the water from there. ‍"," You’re always welcome to hit me up if you have any questions or thoughts you want to share. You can also check out my website or find me on Linked In. If you like Habitual, see a future in it and you’re a marketing-savvy, don’t hesitate to write to me. Who knows, maybe we can revive Habitual together :-)."," On a daily basis, I visit Hackers News, which is great for keeping up to date on everything startup-related. I also visit Product Hunt daily, which I use to keep up to date with the latest apps, websites, and such. After being on Product Hunt for a while, one can also kind of spot certain trends come and go. Certain types of apps, services, and websites seem to emerge around the same time, which is interesting to see. I visit Dribble from time to time, to see what trends there are within the design world. It’s also a great place to gather some inspiration if you’re designing an app or website. Lately, I’ve been listening to the Indie Hackers podcast. Reading interviews with people who have startups, small businesses or just side-projects like the one I have is also a great inspiration and I’ve learned a lot from that. Indie Hackers have from great interviews, so does Starter Story, and of course, Failory, if learning what not to do is your thing. ‍"," I didn’t really have any expenses from the app. When programming an app, there are so many great services out there and as long as you’re under a certain limit (which is often relatively high), you won’t be charged. I did lose most of my summer though, which in hindsight certainly was a loss. These projects tend to grow as you’re doing them and before you know it, you’ve spent a month and a half instead of 3 weeks as I had estimated. ‍",Productivity,Bad Marketing,Denmark,"September 17, 2020",Holger Sindbaek,https://www.failory.com/interview/habitual,"['mailto:holgersindbaek@gmail.com', 'https://holgersindbaek.com/', 'https://linkedin.com/in/holger-sindbaek', 'https://habitualapp.io/', 'mailto:contact@habitualapp.io']",failure,0,,"Holger Sindbaek is the founder of Habitual, a habit-tracking app that was initially created since Holger could not find an app that could suit his habit-tracking needs after reading Atomic Habits book.

93,haptly," Hi, I’m Nelson and I’m a 29-year-old programmer based in Auckland, New Zealand. I’m currently freelancing and working on Contento, a website that makes it easy to guest post by connecting brands and publishers together. Haptly was my startup that ran for a year during 2016. It was a solution for farmers to monitor their grass growth via drone and satellite imagery. I was the co-founder and CTO, in charge of building the software and machine learning algorithms. ‍"," After we were accepted into the Vodafone accelerator in early 2016, we spent most of the time getting stuck into the technical development of the product. Although the problem seemed relatively straightforward at first, the deeper I dug the more difficult it ended up being. There are some classical models for predicting grass growth that works well in New Zealand conditions. However, these rely on more input data than NDVI alone. They rely on soil moisture, localized weather conditions and soil type. There are also different types of grasses used in different farms, each of which have slightly different dry matter properties. At the time of working on it, only a handful of farms currently had all the local sensors installed on their farm.  After 6 months of working on it, day in, day out, motivation began to give way and I couldn’t see a technical way in which we could achieve the accuracy needed - being significantly better than ‘eyeballing’ that farmers currently do. Other factors that played into our decision to close down were: High expenses of using satellite data (50k per year USD for New Zealand)Couldn’t determine how long it would take to complete the R&D cycle, even if it were possible at allWe’re not natural farmers - both of us were business/online software types with less of a personal attachment to the problem Towards the end of Haptly, we began working on another idea, which started to gain traction. It was an idea that we were both more passionate about as we had personal experience with the problem we were solving. We decided to shift our focus to the new business and this, along with the difficulties described above, drove the decision to shut down Haptly.  Because we hadn’t actually taken any investment with Haptly and it was still split 50/50, we actually kept that company as the formation for the new venture. I’m sure that the farmers who signed up were a bit disillusioned, but in saying that, I’m not sure their expectations were too high as others had attempted it in the past with no success either."," The biggest mistake was spending too much time on the early phases of the startup and not enough on determining the feasibility of the product. The biggest challenge was determining whether or not the product was technically possible given the constraints we had.  If we had spent more time working on the feasibility of the idea earlier on, we would have had a better understanding of the R&D requirements around this problem. If we were deeply passionate about solving this problem, it might have been a different story, but as I mentioned, neither of us were farmers and it wasn’t an industry were particularly driven to build a business in.  ‍",,,," We figured the next steps would be to do some more validation with farmers about what an actual product would look like. We drove out to farms to get an idea about how their current dry matter estimation process looked like and asked a bunch of questions to help design the first prototype UI. Our first demo product was something whipped up in React + Material UI framework. It took about a month as I was the only developer and also had to learn React as I went! The demo contained a basic layout of paddocks with dry matter totals and a few charts including a feed wedge. We presented this at a local farming trade show to get a further feel for demand and also some feedback on the UI. This was good validation as again we had a whole lot of farmers turn up wanting to speak to us about when our product would be ready. Looking back, in this period we probably spent too much time on validation from farmers. If we had more domain experience, it would have been obvious that they have been looking for a better solution than ‘eye-balling’ the grass levels for years. There have been various different attempts, but no one has succeeded in making something both sufficiently better and easy to use. Most alternatives involve towing or moving a device around manually, which would take hours on an average size farm. At this point, we started to collect as much data as possible from farmers on their grass levels, including a lot of historical data. I started to explore the use of satellite imagery instead of camera data from drones as it was clear if they could achieve the same outcome, it would have some pretty significant advantages. It would make the product a simple app for a farmer, instead of app + drone they would have configured and fly. This would minimize the work required on their behalf and would also allow an easier expansion into countries with pastoral farming that have more stringent drone regulations than NZ.",," In late 2015 I was freelancing and looking for a startup problem to tackle. Spurred on in part by the hype at the time around drones and their applications, we began searching for use cases. We started by cold calling people asking them about how they used their drones. At one point, we got feedback that vineyard owners and farmers would be worth chatting to, so we started to focus on these niches. It became clear quite quickly that there were a number of areas farmers thought drones could be useful to them: Rounding up stockMeasuring grass levels, a.k.a dry matterSurveying land We discarded rounding up stock and surveying land, as they were already being worked on if not already available. From what we could tell, no one had found an accurate way of measuring dry matter from a drone camera. For context - dairy farmers in New Zealand (and other countries) grow grass for the cows to eat. They have a number of paddocks they rotate the stock through. It’s important to know the dry matter available on each paddock so they can budget the amount of feed available for their stock. E.g. if they predict a deficit in their feed budget, they can order supplementary feed ahead of time or apply extra fertilizer to the lagging paddocks. My background is in primarily in software and mathematics. Although I hadn’t done any machine learning since university 6 years earlier, after speaking with some local experts in the field they suggested this was a problem well within the possibility of solving. ‍"," Every business is different, but with more experience, it’s clear now the biggest risk was actually whether or not the product could technically be achieved. I would advise myself to spend more time identifying the biggest business risks and then figuring out whether or not they could be overcome. ‍"," We were lucky enough to get accepted into the NZ Vodafone Xone accelerator. As part of this, we received some pretty good press coverage, resulting in a constant stream of inquiries through our landing page. We also posted in a bunch of farming groups on Facebook. The inquiries we received gave us a strong indication that this was something farmers wanted. Some of these became early test cases and would send us data to help train our model. ‍", You can learn more on my Twitter and checking out my current startup.," I enjoy the bootstrapping ‘ship it’ approach of Pieter Levels, but also draw inspiration from the other Peter - Peter Thiel. Apart from that, I think there are interesting philosophies in books from Ray Dalio & Warren Buffet. ‍"," We received a small amount of money ($20k) as part of going through the accelerator programme which we used mainly on the business.

94,hashtag-pirate," My name is Nicolas and I am 32 years old. A year ago, I quit my job as an IT support engineer and moved to Spain to pursue my dream of running an online business. A dream to have an influence on our world, to matter, and to have somehow control over my life. HashtagPirate was my first attempt. It was an Instagram hashtag search engine. It was unique as it let you find very targeted posts, whether you wanted them for travel, for business or for leisure. By entering, for example, 2 hashtags into the search bar, you were shown only posts that contained both hashtags in the caption. This first attempt failed hard, and funnily enough, the reason was out of my control. Before I even could start monetizing my search engine with ADs, Instagram was bought by Facebook, and on June 2016, they decided to block any search requests to their API, destroying the core of my service. ‍"," Facebook acquired Instagram few years before I started my website and they hadn’t done any major changes to Instagram since then. So, I had no reasons to worry because searching didn't break Instagram terms of use. By end of 2015, Instagram announced changes to its API, and all services have to adapt by June 2016. Facebook wanted to monetize Instagram. These changes were mainly done to fight spammers and automation tools. I didn't worry much about it as Hashtag Pirate didn't break any terms of use, until I realized later that my website, and the app, which was almost complete, would stop working after June 2016. I applied on Instagram development portal to obtain the API permissions I needed to keep my service running. In June 2016, however, Hashtag Pirate stopped showing any search results. I kept the website running just in case I found a way to make it work again, but I never did. It was painful to watch my traffic decreasing slowly and slowly every month. ‍"," I faced a few challenges in the process of building Hashtag Pirate, mainly getting my point across to the developers. You need to have patience because sometimes developers do it wrong. Another big challenge was to compete against big websites that offered a lot of Instagram search services, even though what I offered was unique and more useful. You might be offering the best service, but that doesn't increase your ranking or give you priority in traffic. Finally, I think my biggest mistake was building my services around Instagram API which I had no control of. I was naive. You should do more research and predict changes for at least the very near future when building a web application. Or at least when you hear about changes to an API, you should change your business right away to avoid failure. ‍",,,," I had a slight background in programming field as we had subjects related to C+, Java, and HTML in university. So, I started browsing development forums, reading articles about Instagram API, PHP, and Databases. I wanted to have an idea of what was needed to make Hashtag Pirate possible. In the end, I thought the best option was to find a freelance developer or startup company to do the work. It's cheap and safe. After some research, I finally picked a capable developer. For me, it was exciting to build your own website for 2 reasons: first, the excitement of offering a public service and reaching people from around the world And second, the excitement of setting up your server, to control your own small window to the world. The main obstacle I found then was the development itself. I had to explain my requirements and requested features over and over to get my point across. The development team was in India, so trying to talk to the actual developer was a struggle. After a period of trial and error, the developers finally understood what I wanted and how to develop it. The project started in May 2015, and two months later (at the end of June), the MVP was complete. ‍",," I was a tech enthusiast, that's why I studied and worked in the field of Information Technology. I have been working for around 6 years back then and proved myself capable of managing my own time. When there aren't technical problems at work, you don't have users to support, and that free time was spent online. I was into sports motorcycles as well, which was more like a hobby. I owned a 2008 Honda CBR1000rr and I enjoyed posting pictures and videos of riding. Eventually, I created an Instagram account specifically to post motorcycle related content. I had a daily theme, for example, Fast Friday: on Friday I would post a 0-100 km/hour acceleration video. However, I faced a problem back then when I tried to find interesting media to post. When you search for #acceleration on Instagram, most results were related to cars not motorcycles, and I had to scroll through pages of results to find what I was looking for. I needed something that allowed me to find content easily. But, as I didn't find it, I decided to create one. ‍"," If I could go back in time, I would change my website to services related to Instagram automation. There is a lot of revenue in that field, and even though it’s against the terms of use, Instagram has no control over it. I would have spent more time understanding what Instagram can control or not, and how to revolve my business around what Instagram can't control :-P ‍"," My marketing capabilities were limited back then. I didn't know about AD campaigns or Search Engine Optimization. I thought I just had to create the website and it would be shown on Google on its own. After some research, I decided that the best strategy was to reach rank #1 on Google in a few keywords I found related to my service. My developers offered me SEO monthly services, so I accepted and started paying them for it. As their link and ranking reports came, I started to better understand the world of SEO and I started doing my own SEO as well. I would search for these keywords, and try to create similar articles or topics to those which were on the first page. These tactics, along with SEO done by the developers, finally put me rank 1 on 3 different keywords. I was so happy that I hired my developer again to create an Android app with the same features as my website by the end of 2015, not knowing the failure that was just a bit ahead of me."," My new attempt to make a business out of Hashtag Pirate started on November 2017.

95,hawkers," My name is Alejandro Betancourt Lopez, and I am a business professional from Venezuela who has launched or funded several businesses. I have served as President of Hawkers Sunglasses since October 2016. I learned of the Spanish start-up company when its founders contacted me to lead a financing round worth approximately 50M euros in early 2016. Hawkers immediately began to scale with my support, and the four founders offered me the role of company president a few months later. The biggest element of Hawkers’ success has been our investment in influencer marketing. The company’s founders, Alex Moreno, David Moreno, Pablo Sanchez Lozano, and Iñaki Soriano had achieved success with influencer marketing before I came on board. Unfortunately, they were dealing with financial struggles that threatened the future of the young company by 2016. We worked together to revamp Hawkers’ influencer marketing strategy by forming partnerships with people who had a large social media following. Hawkers provides them with a free pair of sunglasses and a promo code for their followers. The strategy has been wildly successful, and we have expanded the Hawkers brand throughout Europe, North America, and Asia even as we increase our Facebook advertising. ‍",," One of my biggest early challenges with Hawkers was convincing the co-founders to outsource the manufacturing of sunglasses. They wanted to keep it in-house, but I had business connections that offered an affordable way to get the work done without losing control over the process. If I were starting again today, I would have insisted on more transparent customer service policies right away. Today we update customers immediately if there is a problem with their order at any stage of the supply chain, but that was not always the case. Making this change has led to greater brand loyalty and customer goodwill. ",," When you consider that the co-founders launched Hawkers with a $300 investment and we are worth $60 million today in United States currency, I would say we are doing quite well. A few of our plans include expanding to additional countries and continents and forming more partnerships with clothing, shoe, and jewelry brands to help both our company and theirs sell more products. We also plan to start producing more environmentally friendly sunglasses without sacrificing fashion. ",," I cannot claim credit for the idea of Hawkers’ sunglasses since Alex, David, Pablo, and Iñaki had already developed them a few years before I came along in 2016. Pablo originally got the idea from his brother, who returned to Spain after studying in the United States with a unique pair of fashion sunglasses from the Knockarounds brand. They worked as brand ambassadors for that company before launching Hawkers. Although I did not create the original idea for Hawkers’ sunglasses, I have been instrumental in its branding and explosive sales growth via social media influencer marketing. For example, I reached out to clothing brands in Spain to create partnerships between our sunglasses and their fashion outfits and promoted the partnerships online. Hawkers caters to a younger demographic with the colors and style choices we have chosen for our sunglasses. We have paid close attention to product quality and consumer price along the way, ensuring that customers receive top value from their purchases. Any company can produce a pair of functional sunglasses, but Hawkers focuses more on creating a designer-style product popular among young adults.",," I have long been a believer in contributing to the greater good. I knew after I graduated from Suffolk University with a bachelor’s degree in business administration and economics that I wanted to support projects that would benefit my country. I worked for a bank, an Internet company, and an oil company before co-founding an energy company that brought thermonuclear power to my country’s citizens. Before becoming the leader of Hawkers, I oversaw investments in several business sectors that helped companies achieve their financial goals while providing employment opportunities for citizens. Since I led Hawkers’ first funding round as an angel investor, the founders saw that I could help them with brand expansion, building strategic business relationships, and creating more fundraising opportunities. "," I think the biggest thing I have learned personally and that I share with our staff is to never give up. Hawkers set out to disrupt the sunglasses industry, and they have accomplished that under my leadership. If they had given up at the first sign of financial difficulty, Hawkers would not be the international multi-million-dollar company it is today. When obstacles look insurmountable, we simply find another way and press on."," I would say that our most successful strategy was to invest heavily in Facebook and Instagram and partner with influencers who look attractive wearing our sunglasses. Word-of-mouth advertising has allowed us to expand our business to three continents, something that brings all of us great pride. The focus on fashion versus functionality has also been instrumental. Hawkers conducts most transactions online to cut down on overhead costs associated with brick-and-mortar locations. ", ‍Our online company store ‍Hawkers Facebook page ‍My personal and business website," I highly recommend the use of social media and influencer marketing to achieve organic brand growth. Celebrity endorsements and associations with other top brands are also useful. As an entrepreneur, my goal is to never stop learning. I feel that an attitude of willingness and remaining humble can lead to even greater success.

96,hawthorne-strategies," Hello everyone! This is Michael Hawthorne Jr. or “Rev” and I am excited to tell you about how I created a consulting agency that failed to scale. In 2013 I founded Hawthorne Strategies LLC based in Atlanta, Georgia which was a consulting agency that worked with NFL Players to develop their philanthropic foundations and awareness campaigns to address community issues that they cared about. ‍ ‍"," As I worked to close the contracts that I had coming in the door, a storm was wreaking havoc that would cause me to shut my doors before I could finalize both contract deals. The business problems were quite obvious and were growing each day as I woke up and I didn’t address them. I had a client that required so much of my attention, that I went home in the wee hours of the night with the same question on my mind: “how can I possibly scale if I have clients that require so much of my time?” I soon found myself in a terrible reality where I needed to scale but didn’t have the bandwidth nor enough revenue to consider hiring a second person or did I ( looking back). I often wondered where I went wrong. As I looked at the daily demand of my current client, the cracks started to appear more and more. I realized that I failed to establish the boundaries of my service. I soon found myself fulfilling services for the client that were out of scope from the original contract whereas I was traveling almost every day to different cities serving as a cameraman, PR campaign manager, Website Manager, and sometimes as Administrative Assistant. I know what you’re thinking, how? Even as I was trying to make room for new clients, I ended up losing the contracts because I just couldn’t dedicate enough time to answer the questions on time which raised too many concerns in the end. Ultimately the players signed with a veteran marketing agency. Needless to say, my lack of a robust pipeline of clients, no business plan, nor financial projections of the next five years of how I would scale assured failure. Without the big picture in mind, I was lost in a swamp without a compass, trying to figure out where I was going.  Ultimately, I knew I needed more business experience. With my failure to bring on new clients due to my lack of responsiveness and depleting bandwidth, I found myself painfully closing the doors to Hawthorne Strategies. Shutting the door on something that you built and witnessed brief successes can cause a wealth of mental issues. Closing the doors left me with a bit of depression and endless thought that I was a failure. I ended the contract with my client as thankfully there was a clause in our contract that allowed me to terminate my services. I remember canceling the payroll services and taking my website down and putting all of my files on a storage drive. This was the end of Hawthorne Strategies, but not the end of the entrepreneur in me. After the shutdown, I took a couple of weeks to deal with the emotional baggage that came with us closing the doors before getting my first corporate sales role with a global Fortune 500 company. Looking back, I don’t regret starting Hawthorne Strategies as it was the funniest, most impactful, and exhilarating time of my life. Only entrepreneurs I guess can only ever understand that feeling. One thing was for sure, a sleeping entrepreneur giant was just waking up and things were just getting started."," The biggest mistakes I made with Hawthorne Strategies were not securing capital and leaving my job prematurely even though it required me at a full-time capacity. Additionally, I had created a consulting service with no boundaries and didn’t know how to enforce contractual obligations. I jumped into the Hawthorne Strategies, LLC with peanuts of resources and was totally dependent on my first client for survival, which is a recipe for disaster. That created a stressful situation and created leverage for the client to take advantage of talent and offerings.  The verdict remained: my lack of understanding of how to run a business was at the core of all of my problems. I was trying to figure it all out as I went, like many entrepreneurs but unfortunately, I ran out of time before that lack of knowledge caught up with me.  ‍",,,," So, I remember going on a research expedition in my office that was down in the basement of our home at the time. I remember the constant coffee stains on my desk created by endless nights of researching the rights and wrongs of creating and sustaining a business. My desk was covered in accounting, corporate management, and marketing 101 books. I remember waking up to ruffling of papers and the occasional sighs of breath from my wife who was searching for her stash of books that I stole during the night to understand the business world. With that said, I read a lot and connected with a great attorney who filed my LLC. He was a stellar attorney with a multitude of colorful business experiences. He created my consulting agreement, which was my ticket for contracting businesses.  Among people competing for my first client’s business to do his marketing was a scrawny kid who stayed up all night who mapped out an entire campaign using Gantt charts and tons of stickies. After a series of consultations and weeks of free work, I had signed my first client.  With the revenue I generated, I created my first website through Wix and hired a marketing consultant to do my branding. I went to do as any Founder not savvy in accounting would do: hire an accountant to manage my taxes. Ironically, my wife managed my payroll. When I asked how things were going, she would just smile sarcastically and say “ oh well, it's going”, which was code for “be glad that I love you”.  Before you know it, I was a full-fledged consulting business with my first client generating a decent revenue. I was scared and excited at the same time.",," Oh boy! I remember this day like yesterday. At the time when I started my company, I had just come off the campaign trail of working for a slew of campaigns including Obama for America, Repower America, and Greenpeace.  Hawthorne Strategies LLC was purely formed because at the time, I was working with KSTB Enterprises --a nonprofit development resource agency-- and had received a client who needed more than what the agency was able to offer, which was a national PR campaign. I remember the CEO, Kim Sellars-Bates, coming to me and asking if I ever considered starting my own business. I had no intention of doing so. I remember the immediate fears of failure since I never owned my own business. But Kimberly inspired and believed in me so much that she risked losing me as an employee to see me fly. To this day, I’m ever grateful because she was the very reason that helped me connect with and discover the entrepreneur inside of me that I had no clue existed. Needless to say, that was the beginning of Hawthorn Strategies. I took on my first client and shortly afterward, I was off to my first Super Bowl to debut my client’s campaign. ‍", If I had to start over here’s what I would do differently: Keep my job before hopping full-time into the business.Hire an accountantCreate a business plan and find a lead generation tool once we hit revenue and sales milestones.Secure capital for 12-18 monthsHire another consultant and administratorScale offerings. ‍," Believe it or not, I didn’t put much towards the marketing budget. I took a grassroots approach, which in the political world it would equate to being the bible of marketing approaches. The little marketing that I did was through networking events and constantly selling myself, including providing high-quality work with the client I already had. In a sense, it was working quite well since I had a niche market. I soon found myself in conversation with two other NFL players to develop their foundations whom I met at the Super Bowl during that time.  The two contracts that I had coming down the pipeline were between $3500 - $6000 per month, of course with different time frames. I’d say things were going well until I woke up and saw a heart-aching reality was heading my way fast. ‍ ‍"," Currently, I’m underway with my second venture called Haloloop which is a spirit-tech startup based in Santa Monica, California. Haloloop is a revolutionary spiritual wellness platform that supports your emotional and spiritual health. So, far Haloloop was accepted into a top Santa Monica Tech Accelerator called The Preccelerator and is currently raising capital as we start to scale our services."," I spend most of my time reading books as well as googling articles and saving them to my Evernote. I essentially created a library of business how-tos. Here are some of my favorite resources and why: Harvard Business Review: I picked up my first HBR magazine and never looked away. Timely and insightful business insights matched with scholarly work is a major plus for me. Every time I read HBR I come away with what's happening in the world of business along with the latest trends in businesses across the globe.Fast Company: My wife actually bought my first copy of Fast Company, another great ready usually giving me a vibrant perspective and unique topics that seemed to mesh well into questions I had about understanding business with a flair that always caught my eye. Investopedia: I remember bookmarking Investopedia and then saving tons of articles into my Evernote especially on the subject matters of financing and investments.Linkedin: Linkedin was very helpful in finding business profiles of not only prospective clients but also partners. Today, I think Linkedin is critical to any entrepreneur that wants to examine your network while making strategic moves to connect with new clients and/or partners.  ‍"," As a consulting business, I had little overhead costs of around $300 monthly, which created a monthly profit margin of $3,000.

97,headlime," Hey there, I am Danny Postma. A 28-year-old Full Stack Maker from the Netherlands, who currently lives in sunny (but currently rainy) Bali, Indonesia, after traveling the world for a few years. I’ve founded a few startups (Landingfolio and Inspireframe, to name a few), but my main success story has been Headlime, an AI-powered copywriting software as a service that writes marketing copy for you automatically, which got acquired back in March 2021 for a 7 figure sum. I’m currently working on Rareblocks.xyz, a soon-to-be decentralized marketplace for website components and templates. ",," One of the biggest challenges was the large amount of “entrepreneurs” plagiarizing Headlime, stealing the code and content, and launching it under another name. This made me very cynical back in the days, but I’ve come to realize building a successful product will get copied. You just have to work harder to be more innovative enough than the copycats. Something I managed to do by launching version 2 of the tool. Another obstacle was the large amount of negativity you get when you’re put in the spotlight. Negative comments from customers or competitors trying to sabotage me got me down for a while. Luckily I have a well-supporting group of fellow entrepreneurs around me who would cheer me up and cure my imposter syndrome. Headlime felt like my one golden ticket to wealth, and I was scared daily it would all get taken away. I’d wake up with multiple churn messages in the morning, and it would absolutely ruin my day. Or a competitor got funding, and I’d be scared days were over for me. The most significant upside of selling Headlime might have been calming my mind. Running a high-growth business is tiring. I’m lucky I was still young, without kids. I have the utmost respect for any founder who juggles many responsibilities on the side. ",," One thing to remember is, I was working all by myself on Headlime. And running a fast-growing company solo was taking its toll. I’d spend hours a day on customer support, needed to develop new features quickly as many companies started cloning Headlime’s success, and do the marketing, all simultaneously.  I was so overwhelmed that there was no time to train or hire anyone else. There were three choices for me to make at the time. Get venture funding and work 80 hours a week for the following years, bootstrap the company and risk being overtaken by funded competitors, or sell it. So, when I got two acquisition offers from two prominent tech startups for a life-changing amount of money back in February 2021, I decided to take it.  Seven figures for building a successful startup in eight months for a guy who grew up not wealthy was too good of an offer. It was the right decision, as I’ve realized I like to start things, not manage things.  Headlime is now in the good hands of my friends at Jarvis.ai, who (I’m obviously biased) are creating the next revolution in automated copywriting. After sipping cocktails on the beach in Bali for a few months, my hands got itchy again, and I decided to start my next project, rareblocks.xyz, a decentralized marketplace for digital content. You can follow the progress on my Twitter, where I still build in public.",," Headlime started back in the depths of a global pandemic while in lockdown. I was sitting in the kitchen, drinking cold matcha and writing down ideas I could start working on next. Ideas that would be easy to build and validate before wasting years on them. Then I remembered: Three years ago, a friend and I wrote a book, called Headline Formulas, which has sold a few hundred copies. That's when I decided to turn Headline Formulas into a tool. I decided to focus on this for two simple reasons: 1) books are worth less than tools, and 2) it would be easy for me to build it, as I already had all the content ready. One month of building late, version one of Headlime was finished. It was a simple “content spinner”. The site had 200 formulas, which you could customize quickly by filling in different variables. The tool would then output 200 customized headlines to use in your marketing content. The launch was an instant success, with over $60,000 in sales in the first few weeks. Most of this was thanks to a limited deal I launched, which gave customers access for a one-time fee instead of paying a subscription fee. It honestly blew me away as this was my first ever successful product launch. I think what I did right here is mostly listening to customer feedback. Their vision of the product was beyond my wildest ideas. Customers did not only want headline templates. They wanted all types of content, like emails, Facebook Headlines, and Google Ads. So from that day on, I went on a shipping spree, launching new features, content and updating the tool to users their wishes. I couldn’t have been in a more perfect industry at the right time. Two months after launching Headlime, OpenAI launched their new flagship AI product, GPT-3. A neural network that can write content. And boy, was it powerful. I messaged the CTO of OpenAI to get access and got it. I quickly realized that this AI was insanely good at producing marketing copy. With the proper training, you could explain your business, and the AI would output almost perfect marketing copy for ads, blogs, websites, etc. I saw the writing on the wall. Content spinners are done. AI-generated content is the future. So, I decided to go all in: Headlime would turn into an AI-powered copy generator. I went off the grid for five months and started using all my working hours (and free time) to build version 2 of Headlime.  ",," My story begins in 2015, when I started my first side project, a design gallery highlighting the coolest landing page designs on the internet (I was 21 at the time). When I was working as a freelance Conversion Optimization Specialist, I couldn't come up with solid ideas for landing pages for clients. As a result, I decided to start my side project, called Landingfolio, solving this personal challenge. Make something you'd like to use yourself. Even if no one buys it, it's still worth something to you. Furthermore, you are the most knowledgeable customer and know exactly what you want. Landingfolio expanded rapidly to become one of the most popular landing page inspiration websites, with over 1000 visitors each day. Inspiration websites are extremely difficult to monetize because designers typically visit for inspiration and then leave. I've been running the website for four years without making any money from it, focusing instead on client work. A year ago, I began my journey as a digital nomad, traveling around the world and meeting plenty of talented individuals who have built great online SaaS companies. These folks motivated me greatly, and I realized how successful a startup could be if I only knew how to code. As a result, I had to make a difficult decision. Reduce my client work to two days per week and devote the remaining four days (plus one day off) to learning to code. As a result, I embarked on an eight-month full-time trip to learn to program. I leveraged everything I learned from Landingfolio to create Inspireframe, which was launched in June 2020. In this launch, I tried a lot of different techniques, documented them all for later use, and then used them all in my most recent and successful product launch."," My main lesson is to work on something you’re passionate about or a problem you have yourself. Headlime solved my issue for being horrible in copywriting. I was my own customer, so I knew mostly what I wanted. I got lucky that others had the same problem I had. Another lesson is to build in public. A product won’t market itself. And a great and easy way to do so is by just sharing what amazing stuff you’re working on. Yes, others might copy you, but is your product actually good if no one wants to copy it?  And the last lesson is to ship often and quickly. The only way to see if there is demand for your product is by putting it in front of customers. Don’t work on something for a year without launching. Put out a minimum viable product. If it has potential, your customers will give you valuable feedback on how to shape it further. "," Version 2 was finished in December 2020. While building it, I would drop the occasional teaser on Twitter on how powerful the new tool was. So, when I launched in December, the growth and hype were out of this world. Revenue would double every few weeks. I started December with $1K MRR and reached $20K MRR in February 2021. Most growth happened organically. I’m part of the “build in public” group on Twitter that shares all learnings, numbers, and progress. Lots of these tweets would go viral. This caused a flywheel effect. Bigger accounts would see the tweets on their timeline and learn about Headlime, which got me featured on Techcrunch. The tool also felt like magic, not only for me but for everyone who used it. It solved a big problem for a lot of people. Copywriting is hard. Getting creative ideas is even more challenging. Imagine paying $29 (or eventually $59) a month for a tool that can do all your copywriting for you — a no-brainer purchase.

98,headway,"  I’m Andrew Verboncouer, a 35-year-old entrepreneur and designer based out of Green Bay, WI. I’m one of three partners at Headway, and we’re helping create services, products, and communities that help founders launch and grow startups.  Headway is a company that’s focused on bringing entrepreneurial ideas to market and keeping them there. We work with startups and corporate innovation teams to discover, validate, build, launch, and grow new ventures.  I’m currently Partner & CEO at Headway. Still, I have played many different roles as Headway’s grown, including Head of Design and Head of Product Strategy, in addition to contributing to some projects on both front-end and back-end development.   My main goal for Headway is to align our team and capabilities with partners who have strong ideas that are loosely held and want to increase their chance of success by using research, design thinking, and continuous learning to create experiments and gather evidence that helps make better decisions. ",," One of the biggest obstacles we overcame was making it to just before the 1-year mark. We had dwindling sales, and all of our contracts were running out. In August of 2016, we only had only two weeks of runway left.  One of the 4 founding partners ultimately decided agency life wasn’t for him, and he left the company simultaneously.  With our backs against the wall and only one full-time employee other than the remaining three partners, we had a “come to Jesus” moment. We gathered in Eric’s basement bar, poured a drink, and said either we’re going to do this, or we’re not.  If anyone else was out, this was their opportunity to hit eject.  We all were in. We had a vision for what Headway could become and an appetite to bet on ourselves to make it happen.  ",," Headway has been growing consistently since we were 4 people back in 2015 and are now just shy of 40 full-time crew members.  We’re structured across departments that collaborate in cross-functional teams: Sales & Marketing, Design, Strategy, Development, HR/Admin.  The last two years, we’ve been named one of America’s fastest private companies on the Inc. 5000, coming in at #912 in 2019, and #2765 in 2020.   We plan to continue growing our impact and diversifying our revenue by moving from services only to more scalable and affordable options that include productizing our knowledge, approach, and tooling.  We are currently working on new ways to serve startup founders to help them go beyond our core services. Be on the lookout for new offerings like founder cohorts, startup coaching, and more.",,,," Before Headway, my partners and I worked with other startups as Co-Founders, Partners, and consulting with startups.   Headway came out of a passion and desire to create new things and new ways of doing things. It was also born out of just a gap we saw in the market of how companies were showing up to serve startups. We started as a way to partner and own problems alongside other founders.   Working with passionate founders who have an idea, a vision, and a future impact they want to make is so energizing.  When we were raising for our previous startups, we needed folks to join us to help us go faster because our vision outpaced our velocity. In that process, we only found vendors and not trustworthy partners. They would ask questions about specific requirements, hardening scope, fixed procedures.  But that’s not how startups work. There are so many unknowns, so many surprises, and so much uncertainty.   What we wanted was a partner to take ownership alongside us and help us learn and adjust with the market, figure out how to gain best and serve customers, and care about it as much as we did. I went to college for Business Administration and MIS and was a self-taught designer, mostly from experience doing projects out of passion or friends.   Since high school, we were always creating new things - not for profit, but for fun. We started snowboarding clubs, t-shirt companies, we sold lip-synced mixtape videos long before YouTube existed. Along the path, as we were designing and creating, we evolved from doing websites and e-commerces to full-fledged applications.   Eric, Partner & COO at Headway, is also my brother. In the earlier days of our journey, we started our agency called VERBS, and within that agency, we did all things for all people. With that approach, we had enough work to keep us busy and had the typical freelancer mentality.   When we started Headway, we knew that to grow beyond ourselves we had to find a more targetable niche to attract clients more predictably, know where to find them, and find people who could join us on the journey.   Throughout our startup journey before Headway, we were part of so many different efforts—some that failed miserably, some that were sold, some that are still in the market today. In the worst-case scenario, we built the product in isolation for a year and a half and didn’t talk to a single potential customer.  To our surprise, it failed without any traction at all. We tried to save it by pivoting with the market, but we were out of resources, and more importantly - our energy and enthusiasm for it.  We ended up creating something that no one truly wanted. This was all before Lean Startup, but we started moving into our next startups by creating prototypes, validating with our customers, and having honest conversations around their problems.  That’s where we started shifting from building products to building prototypes and using them to sell into both B2C and B2B opportunities. We wanted to bring this validated and continuous learning to the struggling startups so they could start making traction and get real-world business progress."," There are three main lessons I’ve learned since starting Headway.  People are at the center of everything. Being a founder means that you always have to be selling. And not sales in a slimy way. But sales by educating, clarifying, and communicating in a way that resonates with people. I learned if you want to build a business, you have to focus on the people. That means being a person that other people can get behind. Being someone that people want to join and come alongside. And being somebody that people would like to work with, especially in services people buy from people. Understanding how you help other people get what they want enables you to achieve your goals. Being helpful, genuine, and caring about anyone I’ve come in contact with has helped me build deeper relationships and more meaning in our work. Clarity is power. If you're not clear, you can go in the wrong direction quickly. And when things are blurry, it's easier to get off track. So spending the time to work on clarity at every level is going to pay dividends. Because all things evolve, your company, your customers, and how you serve them also change continuously. I’ve learned that you have to strive for clarity continuously. We always need to ask, “where are we now” and “where are we going?” At Headway, we've implemented EOS (the entrepreneurial operating system), which helped give us clarity through cadences weekly, quarterly, and annually. Problems always exist. At first, your issues are massive. As a founder, you’re thinking about leaving your job you’re trying to figure out if anyone wants what you have to offer. As you solve those problems, other problems emerge. You have clients, but not the clients you want or feel you can add the most value to. You have revenue but not enough margins to build the culture and benefits you want. You have people, but ones that aren’t enjoying all of the work you’re doing. The people who join your team and the clients you help on their journey will leave. It’s not an if, but when. As a founder, it's hard not to take either of those personally. There will always be problems, no matter what. If you understand that from the start, you can detach a little bit of emotion and negative self-talk that leads you to question yourself and the journey you’re on. When you’re a founder, and you’re a father or have a family you go home to at night, problems can prevent you from being present. You are more than what you do! All you can do is solve the problem to the best of your ability and continue to move forward with a plan that avoids/solves/deters that same problem in the future. I had a football coach who said the difference between good and great is a thin line that separates who can learn and build upon their learnings after the first lesson. ","  We’ve grown through long-lasting relationships, partnerships, referrals, and word of mouth as most service-based businesses.   We’ve been starting to put concerted effort and investment into things that attract customers and also things that can help us identify and reach out to them.  When we started Headway, we didn’t leave our full-time jobs and focus on it until we could sell our first customer on a product team coming alongside them. It consisted of 3 engineers and 1 product designer/strategist.  We’ve grown our revenue through increasing rates and starting to niche down from anyone who can use our services to particular offerings. We haven’t figured it all out, and we are constantly experimenting.

99,hello-tyro," My name is Pierre Tillement and I’m from France. I am 27 and currently based in Paris. Since January 2021, I joined Zetoolbox as their new Head of Community. My role is to build the community of the best french-speaking freelancers in the no-code space to help SMBs in their digital transformation. Hello Tyro was a platform matching students with internship opportunities in Belgian startups. I was the co-founder and COO of the startup which we launched in 2018. My role as COO was to put the best tools in the hands of our 4 recruiters to make their job easier by automating most of their work so they could spend their time on the more valuable tasks. I was also in charge of developing the platform which was used by students and startups. To build it we use a stack of no-code tools like Webflow, Airtable, Zapier, Memberstack, and a few others to offer them the best possible experience. We started originally as a service company where startups would pay for our service when we found the right intern for them. As time went on and learned more about the two groups, we built this platform where startups would pay a monthly subscription fee to have access to the candidates we pre-selected. It was 49€/month with an annual commitment and went up to 149€/month with no long-term commitment. "," Covid making its entrance in March 2020 was the catalyzer to the underlying problem we had. We never experienced growth that showcased that we had the right solution. Our marketing strategies weren’t showing any really good results. We were already running low on money from our financing round. With the virus, everyone halted recruitment, our clients looked for ways to cut costs and we were first in line. We practically offered the product to our current customers for close to four months. The recruitment of interns is not an important part of a business (in most cases) and these startups had to deal, like us, with the impact of the virus on their business. Like them, we had to let go the rest of the team and allocate all of our efforts to the platform. Give it a final go if I may say so. Without much results evidently. We also had a conflictual relationship with our startup studio which made things even more difficult to handle.  As simple as it can, we did not have a Product-Market Fit. We just never found the model for which we felt this “exponential” growth which indicates that you’re onto something. We had some happy customers but selling the product was very hard. We did not have startups knocking on our door asking to use our platform. The reasons? Hard to say as there are so many factors. Was it the price of the subscription? Was it our commercial pitch? Hard to say as we did have to stop the company a bit earlier than we expected. The thing I learned from this is to never be satisfied with your results (revenues) and always test new things to improve your metrics. We had to shut down because we ran out of cash and could not go on with the tools and the team in place. So we filed for bankruptcy. ",,,,," It took 2.5 years to get to the platform we liked but it was a very gradual process. We first started doing everything by hand. Understanding the needs of startups and how they made decisions about recruiting an intern or not. Doing the same on the students’ side to understand their expectations and what they wanted in their user experience. About a year in and lots of tests, we saw the opportunity of building a business with recurring revenues. As we had spent countless hours with both groups we had a great vision for what the platform should look like to create value for startups and students alike. We started experimenting with platform alike features where we would cut the time we spent on certain tasks and automating a few.Our v1 was a weekly email to startups with the CVs of the top 10% of students that we selected. We saw that this created as much value as the agency service and even gave more freedom to startups who could discover more students that we might have not introduced with our former way of working. After this successful test, we decided to spend some time on no-code tools to create the first product. It was a shared Airtable view where startups could discover students on a better-looking platform and not in a simple email. Then, we got close to the final version where we built the platform on Webflow and took subscriptions with Memberstack. Over the last 9 months, we added nice-to-have features such as the possibility to filter candidates, allow startups to send a crush to a student with one click and a few others. We ran into a ton of obstacles. The internship market is still very young in Belgium. Startups aren’t always aware of the value that can be created by talented students. It took lots of time to educate these startups to help them see what interns can bring when it comes to developing their business. To do so, we shared the stories of some students who had great results and where some ended up getting recruited for a job by these startups.  We also had technical challenges where no-code tools would not allow us to deliver on some startups’ wishes in terms of features. We had to get creative and find a few smart hacks to reach these goals. We didn’t have any big fancy launch but shared it within our existing networks and startups we knew in Belgium. We lacked expertise in distribution and I see it as one of the main reasons it failed in the end. Pricing was always a challenging topic. Startups only really saw the value of our platform when they had successfully recruited an intern with Hello Tyro. Except that it could take some time so we had to spend extra time on new clients to help them find the talented student they were looking for as fast as possible. The first thing we did for pricing was to launch the product as a free beta where some startups could test the product at no cost. After a while, we would chat with them to get their feedback on the experience and test a few different prices with them to see where we were at. From their feedback, we implemented a few different prices on different engagement levels (annual, semester, and monthly) at 49, 99, and 149€. "," We did a few different things as marketing goes. From paid ads, targeting on Linkedin, content creation (written and video), to word of mouth, we did it all. The only one that worked was WOM. The thing that made this channel work was that startups that enjoyed our service would talk to others about how great Hello Tyro was. It made our job of selling much easier with this kind of social proof. Prospects knew it worked directly from people who they trusted. It is what lacked with other marketing channels. They did not have the proof that the platform worked and they were more reluctant to make the jump and start paying for a service that can be pricey for up-and-coming startups who have limited funds. Ultimately, selling is all about creating and nurturing a relationship with your prospect. Talking with them, asking questions, and showing a genuine interest in their problems are the best strategies to turn this connection into a paying customer. After doing so, you can say if your solution could help them, and selling it is easier than just via cold emails or marketing your solution without knowing the person you’re talking to. With that in mind, we tried to connect directly on Linkedin and get the conversation going with our prospects. We did so even when they had no immediate interest in our product to acquire knowledge about the industry we were in, understand their finer problems when it came to recruiting interns.  As for other strategies, we did a few mailing campaigns without any results. We collected tons of emails during these years and decided to launch in France during the summer of 2020. So we created our campaign and sent it out. It returned no results. Automated cold emails are great because you can be lazy. Draft your email, send it to 500+ contacts but it is not a suitable strategy for an early-stage product like we had. We needed more feedback from customers and prospects to pinpoint their needs and know where to press when marketing our solution. "," I had gone to the United States for my bachelor’s degree in economics. After graduating, I came back to Europe and Belgium to start my M.B.A. As we launched Hello Tyro during my studies and saw its potential and growth, I decided to drop out of school to fully focus on the company and give ourselves the best chance to succeed. Even if it ultimately failed, it is not a decision I regret one bit. So many learnings came out of this experience which I would have not gotten following the M.B.A. The idea came as a new status was created for students in Belgium “Student entrepreneurs” which gave them more opportunities to work and make money from jobs. We had the conviction that some talented students could take on more challenging jobs in startups to develop new skills that could be very helpful for their future careers. It was my very first entrepreneurial endeavor so I had no frame of reference when it came to launch and build this company from the ground up."," Keep testing and talk to more customers and prospects. We might have believed a bit too early that we had the right product. We could have learned more from our user base to identify the value we could have created for them, features they would have liked.  ‍",, You can read more about this story on my blog.

We were down to us two founders and were paying for the stack of no-code tools we used to build the platform. We probably could have gone on by investing a little bit of our own money to keep the platform running but we could not with our legal setup with the startup studio and investors who had joined.

100,helpwise," Hey, I’m 31 years old & currently based out of New Delhi, India. I’m a chemical engineer by education, the only job that I ever took (& left after 3 months) was into investment banking. But, I always loved programming and built my first tech business when I was around 16 yrs old. In the last 10 years, I have built 4 businesses, of which 2 got acquired (last one by New York Times), 1 failed and 1 is currently running & growing. Currently, I’m running a digital products company called SaaS Labs. We’re a 60 people team working remotely across India, Philippines, and the US. Bootstrapped & profitable, we were the 5th Fastest Growing Company in Deloitte India Tech Fast50 & 54th fastest growing in APAC last year.  We have 3 products - 1) JustCall - a cloud phone system for sales, support and remote teams 2) CallRoot - inbound call tracking for marketers 3) Helpwise (our latest product) - a shared inbox for email, SMS, and WhatsApp.  ‍",," Shared inbox is critical software for any business as your business runs on it. So, the biggest challenge for us was to provide 24 hr support to our customers. Also, given our team’s location (India), the time zone difference made things even more challenging.  So, to overcome this, we firstly worked in shifts ourselves. And, then use Upwork to hire a support agent in PST timezone.     Timezone difference b/w our key market and our team’s location is definitely a big disadvantage.  But, the bigger challenge is that the shared inbox market is still pretty small in comparison to some of the other SaaS domains like CRM, cloud telephony, digital signature, etc.  I’m not saying that the market is tiny but it’s not big enough to create enough organic growth to sustain & grow. So, it will require a lot of effort and capital to create a mini-brand and reach the first million. Please note that I’m talking about market size in relative terms (i.e. in relation to markets our other products are in).  I feel that the worst mistakes that we have made as a team are:  Delaying our launch in order to build more & more features before launch. Targeting broad & multiple use cases. In the last few months, we have got some clarity on best-suited use cases for our product but we have definitely lost some time and money.  ",," For SaaS Labs, we are aiming for $10 million annual recurring revenue by the end of 2021.  In Helpwise, we were on the path to reach $1 million ARR by November this year but we are now expecting to reach that figure by mid-next year.  We are currently 60+ team members (more than doubled since Jan 2020). And, we are profitable.  Coming to the Helpwise product, we are really excited about our upcoming feature Chat Platform. Our customers will be able to add a chat widget on their sites. This chat widget will not only work as a normal customer chat feature but it will also allow us to integrate with other customer support chat, conversational marketing and chatbot products. So, from a single screen, our customers will be able to manage email, SMS, Whatsapp, and chat (coming via our own chat widget or Intercom/Drift, etc). ‍",," We run an interesting Seed Funding program in our company. It is something like Y Combinator. When we decide to build a new product or give a shot to an idea, we give a $20,000 budget and 3 months to a team of 3-4 people to build and launch the product.  This budget can be spent on anything - hiring & team building, marketing, technology, consulting fees.  So, Helpwise got $20,000, 2 young engineers (Vibhor & Rishabh), 1 Engineering Manager (Prabhat), and 3 months’ time. By August, our MVP was ready and we started inviting beta users (mostly our customers of our other products and our friends at other startups).  Deciding how to price your product is one of the most important early decisions that you have to take. And, interestingly, the least amount of time is given to that. Learning from this mistake from my previous experience, we spent a good amount of time discussing and testing different pricing models and plans.  Finally, two important factors influenced our decision:  The reason why we built an internal use email software - we found other products super expensive, mainly because of per seat per month pricing for small businesses growing from 5 to 20 to 50. Cost shoots up quite significantly. How one of the most-used software (Basecamp) in our company is priced? So, our final pricing plans came out to be: Free Plan for up to 5 team members (aka small business) Pro Plan for $99/month for unlimited team members & 5 shared inboxes I know that most of the SaaS practitioners consider Fixed Price for Unlimited Seats as a sin but we really want to give this a try. It has worked for Basecamp, so hopefully, it will work for us as well :)  ",," When I started my current company SaaS Labs, the thesis of the business was (& still remains) that we are big-time bullish on 3 major themes:  Cloud Adoption: More & more businesses around the world will adopt cloud for running their business operationsRemote work: A good chunk of the workforce will work remotely. Not necessarily work from home but away from HQ or the work desk for sure.  Automation: Every business will adopt some kind of automation to improve profitability and compete well with other businesses.  In late 2017, as the JustCall (a cloud phone system https://justcall.io) team started to grow, we felt a need for shared inbox software to handle our help@, sales@, etc email addresses. For the next 12-15 months, we tried all the available products in the market. But, all these products were either too expensive or too complex. So, we decided to build our own shared inbox for our own team, for our own use only. Our managers helped us build analytics on top of it to track KPIs.  During a team offsite, when we were planning our annual revenue growth and goals, someone suggested launching our in-house team email software as a product in the market. This product satisfies all the points which are part of our thesis so we decided to go ahead and launch this as Helpwise. Basically, this product came out of our own necessity. On 2nd Dec 2019, we launched Helpwise on Product Hunt & got featured. The current product is 5-10x better & powerful than the first version. "," I’ll definitely launch the product a bit earlier. Also, having marketing expertise early on is something we are going to seriously consider for any future new product. We did well to spread the word and get early customers but that was not predictable at all.  "," At SaaS Labs, as we build and launch so many products on a regular basis, we have a playbook for our product launches. I’m going to share that here with everyone.  Product Hunt Launch: If you launch your product at the right time (around 12-1230am PST), with great images and an engaging first comment - there are high chances of getting featured on the first page, obviously if the product is good. This will generate 1000s of visits. Now, it’s on you how you make most of it. SEO: We start working on important keywords almost 2 months before the launch. We do a lot of offsite and onsite SEO to make it to the first 3 results for important terms.Cold outreach to Linkedin contacts, customers of other products.Paid Ads: It is good to have a working paid channel that is at least generating clicks with high CTR. This means that there is a legit demand for the product and you can scale.Integrations with other tools and getting listed on market places.   All in all, we signed up over 1700-2000 folks in a short time. And, 55 converted to a paid subscription within weeks of launch.  SEO & Integrations worked the best. Paid ds did a good job & Product Hunt didn’t get us many customers but definitely helped us pick the momentum.  We’re growing organically at a healthy rate month on month."," You can follow me on Twitter here.

101,henry," I’m Martin Borchardt, CEO and one of the co-founders of Henry, a LATAM startup that teaches software development for free and helps students get a job, in exchange for a share of their future income. ‍",,,," We’ve recently received a $300k investment from Y Combinator, which was a great achievement. We were accepted on Y Combinator’s Summer Batch, which is a 30-day program where they help you grow your business’ KPI 20-30%. The program ends with a demo day that gives you access to a network of more than 2000 investors from around the world. I’d say +70% of startups of Y Combinator Batch raises money there so chances are very high. As for goals, we aim to have taught +100,000 developers within the next five years. Also, we’re thinking about launching a data sciene career in 2021. Many students are demanding it. However, the demand from businesses for data scientists is much lower than the demand for software developers. ‍",," To validate the idea, we created a Wix website which had a Typeform survey for people to apply to the program. From day one, I think we had around 100 applicants. From there, we grew for a couple of days sustainably 100 applicants per day and after a couple of months, we started growing 20% a month. The way we managed to get these 100 people was mainly through 4-5 posts we made on my Twitter and LinkedIn profiles. We also did some Instagram ads which worked really well. My advice is to build your business idea as fast as possible and launch it to market so as to test your assumptions. There're a lot of entrepreneurs that are six months building a product without getting any feedback from customers just to find out that, when they launch, the reality is very different to what they were expecting. Right from the beginning, the differences between this new idea we launched and the student loan company, were very clear. The student loan product was very unattractive from the customers’ point of view, due to Argentina’s high inflation. The new version, instead, was zero-risk for the student, as they only had to pay if they began making a big income. I was completely new to Income Sharing Agreements when we launched Henry, but I was open to pivoting to another business model. I always advise entrepreneurs to focus on solving a problem, and not on the solution itself. ‍",," Before building Henry, I founded a FinTech startup called Nubi, which is a cross-border payment system that integrates with PayPal and TransferWise. While in Nubi, I found it really difficult to hire developers, basically because there is a lack of talent in the market. A lot of people are still more attracted by the typical careers of the 20th century (law, journalism, etc.), rather than computer science. Henry surged as an attempt to solve this problem of the market. The first solution I came up with consisted of a company that gave people loans so that they could afford studing engineering. We gave 26 loans, but the company soon failed, mainly because of three things: Argentina’s high inflation rates were incompatible with providing loans with a friendly interest rate for students.It was difficult to scale.It was very capital intensive. So I did a pivot and decided to build the Lambda School for Latin America. Lambda School is a famous school in the US that trains software developers for free and helps them find a job in exchange for a share of their future income. Henry has the same model. Once the students get into our program, they learn web development, and once they get a job, they start paying 15% of their income until they reach a max cap of $4,000. We are super proactive with getting the students a job because we basically don't make money if they don't get one. Our incentives are aligned with the student. More than 90% of students that got a job are because we’ve introduced them to the company.",," We don't have a big problem in terms of student acquisition, because it's 100% digital and is zero upfront cost, making it very easy and tempting to apply. Once the first students began to get jobs, they started spreading the word. Nowadays, a lot of people that comes into Henry is because a friend or family member has already passed through our program and has had success. Unfortunately, we can't accept everyone because our resources are limited. That’s getting more difficult every month as we have more applicants. I think that the net impact of COVID-19 on Henry has been positive. Despite some companies (for example those in the travel industry) have stopped hiring software engineers, many others have kept hiring as they have had to digitize their operations or because they weren’t affected by the pandemic at all. Also, we teach people 100% remotely so students have been able to keep learning why staying in their homes.", Here’s our website.

102,hitronasplet," Hi, my name is Aleš Krivec. I graduated with a degree in computer science and worked for some time as a PL/SQL developer. I am currently developing WordPress Themes for sale on my shop PremiumCoding and for Themeforest, TemplateMonster, and Mojo Marketplace. I am also a passionate landscape photographer and I spend a lot of my free time in the mountains and iconic spots, catching that perfect morning light. The product of that is my second website DreamyPixel. However, before achieving success with these two startups, I failed with HitroNaSplet, a hosting reseller company. ‍"," While the business wasn’t a total failure, the problem was that it didn’t generate enough revenue to be worth the time invested. We figured there was no way we can do that for a living (without having a daily job also). There was just too much work with support, refunds, and billing to be worth it. So, we started building websites and later developing WordPress Themes. After that became our main source of income, the hosting reselling become just a pain in the ass. The problem with hosting is that you can’t just close it, you have responsibilities to your existing customers. So, the procedure to close it was quite long and tedious. Fortunately, in the end, one of the biggest hosting resellers in the country offered a small sum to buy everything and we were happy to just get rid of everything.  So, my advice would be if you start something similar to calculate well what you need to invest (not just money, but also your time) and what the minimum and maximum revenue can be. And what would increase revenue mean for you. Because when our revenue increased, the invested time that we had to put in support was just too much to handle, yet we didn’t make enough to hire someone to do it. In WordPress themes business it’s different, our revenue jumped high very soon, but we also had enough money to hire support staff to work full time on customer’s emails. ‍",,,,,,," I always wanted to have my own business so I started a few ventures in the past that I thought could be successful. One of those businesses was hosting reseller website. This was about 10 years ago and one of my previous businesses (online computer shop) already failed. Back in the day it was pretty popular to start an online store and I also wanted to have one. But it turned out it’s not as easy as I thought it would be. Some big players were already on the market and getting in front of them in Google search was nearly impossible. After the initial boost, everything went downhill pretty fast. ‍"," Probably nothing since it turned out great for us in the end. But if we wanted to succeed in the hosting market, we probably should invest in the promotion and hire someone to handle the support so we could focus on promotion and growth. But we wanted to do everything by ourselves and it just became overwhelming.  We learned a lot about hosting, websites and what people actually need and that helped us a lot with our next venture which turned out to be pretty great. We saw what users usually do when starting the website. A lot of them is very lost at the start (especially the ones starting personal blogs). Most of them would just like to blog, but they have no idea how to make the first few steps. And you have to be aware of that when you are selling themes. People don’t just buy themes as a product, they also buy your support and help to get them started. Your help means a lot to most people. And grateful customers are also returning customers.  ‍  Always start with something that you at least like a little. If you hate doing something in the first place and you are only doing it for money, the chances that you are going to build something sustainable is very small. And if you fail you will regret the lost time a lot less if you enjoyed the path. Otherwise, you will just be upset that you lost so much time developing something that didn’t work out. ‍"," We simply created a website with a friend and started to resell domains and hosting packages. We invested a lot of our time in SEO and for some time we were placed on the first page in Google (for Slovenian language).  We already had the knowledge of building an online store and this wasn’t that far from it. We planned our content carefully for SEO reasons and soon our daily visits were quite good. We didn’t do a lot of marketing as that wasn’t that popular back then and we didn’t have a lot of knowledge about. Our focus was mainly Google and at the start the revenue was decent. We also created a Facebook page and a Twitter account but I had no idea how to promote the business well across the social platforms. So besides learning a few things, it was more or less a loss of time."," You can learn more about what I do now in the article on IndieHackers. And you can, of course, check my WordPress themes in our shop that is the main source of income (besides Themeforest).", Number one is Google. I know it’s not an actual resource but most of the searches start at Google. Then you end up at websites that actually offer what you need. Probably website that I used the most is Tympanus.

In the end, we didn’t lose any money, but our salary while doing this wasn’t really great, to put it mildly. So, working almost for free wasn’t very fun at the end. The most valuable thing we gained from all of this was the knowledge that allowed us to move forward to the next step. To create, sustain and support WordPress themes and plugins.

103,hot-barber," Hi! I’m Julia, a 24-year-old web developer living in San Francisco. My co-founder, Eric, and I are working on an online video editor called Kapwing. We built and launched Kapwing about a month ago and are now growing it and developing new features. ‍"," We didn’t have a short-term monetization strategy. At first, we thought that we could make Hot Barber a transactional site where customers reserved and paid for haircuts online. But, through interviews with domain experts, we realized that scheduling and payment processing are complex, decentralized problems and that the margins would be low since hairstylists have a personal relationship with their clients and many existing alternatives. We also had trouble getting enough stylists onto the platform. So, we pivoted Hot Barber towards discovery - “Houzz for hair” - and planned to aggregate all existing data on the web about stylists to help people find a personalized match. But, like a blog, a discovery website doesn’t make money unless it attracts a lot of traffic, and we were worried that our runway would run out before we were able to make money on ads. So we paused the project and moved on to something new. We’re planning to shut down the Hot Barber website soon. ‍"," Our MVP wasn’t focused enough on a pressing user problem. From weeks of user interviews, it seemed that nearly everyone we talked to had a gripe about their hair experience, but the complaints were related to different issues: expense, booking, opaque pricing, quality, etc. We grouped all of these user needs together under the umbrella of “finding a good hair stylist,” but we should have been more focused on delivering a product that addressed one need very well instead of many needs halfway. Also, we are first-time entrepreneurs, which makes it riskier (and scarier) to work on a project that won’t make money for a long time. I think that Hot Barber is doable if the founders raised venture capital at the onset or built and grew the website on the side while working a full-time job, but it wasn’t a good fit for us. ‍",,,," Hot Barber is a simple website that lets hair stylists set up profiles and customers browse portfolios for the stylists they need. Since we were focused on affordability, we started by partnering with local cosmetology schools (with cold calls and emails) to built the initial supply. Our hypothesis was that, for some services, senior beauty school students could provide high-quality service for a fraction of a price of an elite salon. This turned out to be only partly true - students definitely need experience before they’re as capable as a professional stylist, but some students have experience before they start cosmo school. We designed and developed an MVP ourselves and spent time at our cosmo school getting students onboard. Our plan was to launch a pilot with one beauty school and Facebook ADS to generate some demand, then move towards a beta with hundreds of students from all the schools in San Francisco.",," We started Hot Barber to help people get cheaper, higher-value haircuts. I felt like I was overpaying for my salon in San Francisco, but I was also too afraid to risk going somewhere cheaper. Plus, it was hard for me to connect with a stylist who knew my hair type. Hot Barber was a website designed to connect customers with stylists without the salon middleman. We wanted to simplify the process of finding a great hairstylist with more visuals, more personalization, and an emphasis on affordability and showcase the awesome talent of up-and-coming stylists. ‍"," I would have focused my efforts - user interviews, launch strategy, and product development - on the problem of discovering a local hair stylist rather than the whole experience of finding and getting an affordable haircut.  I learned that my first startup needs to be something with a shorter term monetization strategy so that I can gain confidence in my own development and growth skills before risking several years and a lot of money. I also learned that marketplaces are hard and that I should focus on building something great for customers before trying to get suppliers on board. ‍  It’s easier to build a solution for a problem that is really pressing, something that people are already spending money on and/or searching for on Google. It’s also easier if you build a product either for people like you or for a domain you have expertise in. These are obvious pieces of advice, but Hot Barber failure definitely reinforce them for me. ‍",,," I really enjoyed The Lean Product Playbook and The Design of Everyday Things, although reading articles online tends to be more practical when you have specific questions. ‍ Where can we go to learn more?

104,howell-market," My background is in Marketing and in the last 6 months, business development. I got into digital marketing about 3 years ago and fell in love with it. I started out helping friends and family for free to get the experience, and this last year was able to manage just over $8 Million in ad spend! I have always loved business though. When I was a kid, about 4 years old, I would write stories and sell them to my family members at reunions for $.25. That’s why in the last 6 months I have been focusing on using those marketing skills to actually help grow businesses and get them to the next stage. ‍"," The short answer is, because of my partners.  Like I said, I partnered with family and friends. The fact that they are family and friends is actually not the reason it didn’t work out. The reason things didn’t work out is because I choose partners that were unfit to help run the business and weren’t passionate about the vision of the company. This was my idea, but I invited my friends and family along to help ease the burden of the workload, and I knew I could trust them. I didn’t know though that some were looking for free money, others had no idea what they were doing, and eventually none of them “had time”. From day 1 I was doing everything from product selection, to marketing, to operations, etc. I would give tasks (not even roles) to the other partners and they would just never get done. I would end up doing them and then move on, cause I was passionate about getting this off the ground. While this was a side project, we did expect to spend a good amount of time getting everything ready to launch. We set expectations about how long we would give a go before we called it a failure but didn’t even get close (we originally said 6 months but closed after 3). While partnering with your friends and family may be advisable against, I had a rather good experience. Our relationship grew closer and no hard feelings were left. I would suggest, though, that when choosing partners you choose strategic partners that can cover your weak points. I would also avoid bringing in “Capital only” partners until you can cover all the operations of the business with other partners or employees, because “capital only” means that they won’t help you unless it’s absolutely necessary. ‍",,,,," The business was purely online (the site has since been shut down) and was started by my 2 brothers, a friend, and myself. The set up was to start out with a drop shipping site until we got enough visitors to start bringing on individual sellers. The site started out as just a simple Shopify e-commerce site with a few basic apps. This was our set up. We had a formula that would tell us our minimum selling price. For example, this shirt would sell for $25 normally, but we would only need to sell for $17.26. This allowed us to know how much discount we could offer and how much influencer take away we could allow. After getting our first customer to sign up, we quickly realized that Shopify wasn’t going to work and that we were going to need a better system. Unfortunately, we never made it to that new system. After spending $10 on an Facebook ad we realized that paid ads probably weren't the way to go. We had too low of engagement to be sustainable. ‍",," I have this crazy dream to make my name a household name, like Trump, Tony Robbins, etc. I ultimately want to build an empire of businesses. I thought of having an online store like Amazon, eBay, Etsy type of store, where individual sellers could come to sell their products. To get this started, I just went about drop shipping to get traffic to then use to sell the idea. We started with mostly interesting gift ideas, and actually got 1 seller from Ireland to sign up and start selling these really unique suits.  ‍"," I actually have started to do another e-commerce store. I was brought on as a partner, so it’s not my passion project, but my experience has led us to avoid some of these same pitfalls.  There are a lot of things that I would do over. I think it is easiest if I bullet point them for easy reading: Pick strategic partnersUse Pinterest moreStick to 1 niche at first (we went really broad and then cut back to gag gifts)Use others (such as influencers) to get your product and store out thereStay committed. I think with most businesses you have to keep going even when you don’t make money. That’s why keeping overhead low is so important.Focus on quality. People want quality and speed, but the quality is always the most important. ‍  I think this goes back to the bullet points in question 8. Keep on pushing. Things may not go your way and you may have bad days or even months, but you have to keep pushing. You never know when a big deal is coming and if you close your business, you are closing your doors to opportunity. ‍"," We started out on Facebook and Instagram, with Instagram being 90% of our efforts. We grew our Instagram account to about 500 followers in the first few weeks. We did run a few promotions but didn’t have much success with those as we didn’t have the capital required to compete on a large enough scale. We focused on Instagram, because of its amazing potential to reach an audience organically. 85% of our sales came from organic Instagram. I actually have written an article on how to use Instagram organically, and this is everything I did and followed with Howell Market. If I had to go back and redo this, I would have also included Pinterest in our marketing efforts. Pinterest, I think, is one of the most underutilized marketing platforms of today. Pinterest drives traffic and can easily be put on auto-pilot. I was probably spending close to 2-4 hours a day on Instagram trying to grow our account, and on an average Pinterest account I spend about 2-4 hours a week and get way better results!"," Like I said, my passion is marketing and business. I have used that to create my own marketing agency, Howell Marketing. We focus not only on your marketing goals but also your business goals. We ultimately want your business to grow. I am always available for questions on Instagram or LinkedIn."," Like mentioned before, choose strategic partners that will cover your weak spots. If you’re not good a marketing, get marketing partner. If you’re no good at paperwork or office stuff, get someone who can do that. I honestly love partners, cause if you choose the right ones, you will have a team of people supporting you and holding you responsible for getting things done.    I am a big marketing fan, so I tend to study more on that end. I am creating my own learning center where I share what I have learned not only in marketing but also in business. These are my learning resources.  I also listen to a lot of Social Media Examiner and Working Without Pants, as those really align with my passions. I really like a book called “The One Minute Millionaire”. I really like to advise people to find smaller less known authority figures to follow. People like GaryVee, Tony Robbins, Tai Lopez, etc. are all just using their big names to push their own agenda and while you may find some good nuggets, you will have to rummage through a lot of garbage to get it. The smaller guys tend to focus on giving real and insightful information that you can use.  "," The good thing about online retail/e-commerce is that there isn’t a lot of costs. We had to pay for our LLC paperwork and the monthly hosting fee to Shopify. Our overhead was about $40/month, so that wasn’t anything hard at all. We did break even before shutting down, but with such low overhead that is only a handful of orders we had to get.

105,hubrif," My name is Tobi Ogunwande, a lover of film, tech and good food. I am a self-taught filmmaker and a startup co-founder of 2 startups. One failed (Hubrif) and the other is profitable (Festivilia). My first company was Hubrif a curated video on demand platform for streaming high quality African short films (basically, the Netflix of African short films). The idea for Hubrif came as a result of my frustration in having to discover and watch very good African short films. I was getting ready to shoot my first film in 2015 after a few months of building my theoretical knowledge of filmmaking, which I did reading eBooks and watching Youtube videos. I wanted to watch some short films about my topic already made which was about female molestation but couldn't find. Spending so much time searching on youtube and still couldn't find what I was looking for. I went on to just shoot the film the way I could. Fortunately, it was quite successful in its festival runs, a few of which I was able to attend. One of the benefits of attending these film festivals was networking opportunities. When I began to hear of similar challenges by other young filmmakers, with my love and passion for technology, this convinced me to build Hubrif. Shortly after the death of Hubrif, I launched Festivilia a film festival distribution and submission platform that matches films to the right film festivals and allows filmmakers to submit to them by just filling one submission form. The platform’s goal is to save filmmakers the stress and burden of blindly submitting their works to film festivals by matching films to relevant festivals and submitting automatically, increasing their chances of selection and saving them time and money. Festivilia is currently profitable and its success has been partly due to the lessons learned in building Hubrif.  I was working as an IT Support / Business Development Personnel for another startup called Cartehub (www.cartehub.com) a Multi-merchant e-commerce platform for African goods when I founded Festivilia. It's interesting to note that I built the website (festivilia.com) from scratch after taking a few months to learn website designing (on my own of course through youtube videos). ‍"," Problems started when had to accept the reality of things that even though our goal was noble and our market was a niche, it was just too small and to make matters worse, we couldn't figure out how to monetize as we were running out of money (Video hosting fees, etc). We knew we didn't want to go the Ad-route model like Youtube but instead use the subscription model like Netflix. It just didn't work out, partly because we didn't know how much to charge. We were looking at using carrier billing as well but we just couldn't implement successfully. I was getting desperate to raise funds with only less than a month runway left, fortunately, we got an investor with a seed fund of about $2000 for 20% equity, a co-founder status and taking over the business aspect of the company.  It was a bad decision that would later hunt us. This was our second mistake. Due to business and creative differences, things started to fall apart with our investor. out technical co-founder had to leave the company partly due to this so we had to hire someone else to take care of the tech. We spent almost half of the raised capital to keep this new person for about 3 months. Here’s where we announced our shut down."," To sum up our mistakes, I highlighted our mistakes to make it easier. Our market was too small.We just couldn't figure out how to effectively monetize. We implemented a few monetization features, however, customers just weren't willing to pay for it.We created unnecessary costs for ourselves and spent our limited funds covering those costs.Inability to be able to focus on one mini-project and seeing it through before moving on. We were always quick to change course at the slightest challenge.At a point, we started chasing the wind. What doesn’t concern us, we saw ourselves chasing.We had serious management issues. Implementation of decisions was very slow and this was because founders argued and argued on what direction to take over time. We barely ever agreed on anything.We ran out of funds and then slowly, we saw life began to drain from us.Over time, we all got discouraged and worn out.We realized late that Hubrif would have been a brilliant project as a Social Not-for-profit initiative. Perhaps we would still have been alive if we treated it as such.At the height of it all, I had to take a stand. Either to keep petting an almost dead horse or move on to help nurture a newborn horse. I chose the latter. ‍",,,," I loved technology but I wasn't a computer programmer neither did I have the funds to hire one to help me build the platform. This was my first hurdle in building Hubrif. I had to find a technical co-founder who not only had the skill-set to build a VOD platform but also must love filmmaking. It took about 1 year to find that person. In the meanwhile, I was working as a field agent too for a market research company to pay my bills until I was able to secure a better job, attend auditions for acting roles (I forgot to mention. I started out as a stage actor back in the university and gradually moved to film after school) while continuing to structure how hubrif was going to be. I came across an article written by him concerning building a VOD platform and when I finished reading that article, I just knew he was the one I have been looking for. I reached out to him and convinced him to be my technical co-founder. I would be in charge of content acquisition, marketing and administration while he takes care of the tech. We both split the equity equally, 50:50. In a record time of 2 weeks, we launched Hbrif with 50 curated African short films. As I had met my technical co-founder from an online vibrant tech community back in the days called Radar, we decided to announce the launch and ask for feedback there. No actually. He was building an online video platform that enables you to build a VOD platform. it was called vindie.io. Hubrif was housed under the platform. ‍",," Before Hubrif, I had just finished my Bachelors' Degree in Economics from the University of Ibadan, Served my father's land in a compulsory one year National Youth Service Programme and was job hunting. Since I had a lot of free time, I channeled most of my time into brainstorming how to build Hubrif. I was working as a field agent too for a market research company to pay my bills until I was able to secure a better job Hubrif was built to be a better alternative to other video platforms for watching African short films. It became clear that other huge video platforms like Youtube were like oceans and African short films get drowned in the midst of other kinds of contents. It's like throwing a pin into a Haystack. I felt we needed a better alternative and that was why I set out to build Hubrif."," If I had to start all over again, I would never have opened a dedicated hosting platform. I remembered I was advised to just transfer all our video hosting cost to Youtube by uploading all our contents there and embedding on our website but I strongly opposed saying we never want to have anything to do with any other platform. We were going to build everything in-house and never rely on a 3rd party platform. I was blind to the fact that our users didn't care which video hosting partner we were using but was all about the contents. As long as they could watch films, nobody cares if it was embedded or not! We realized this very late. ‍"," When we launched, we had a lot of encouraging words from the local tech community with regards to the simplicity of the platform and from the filmmaking community with regards to the quality of short films. We were very proud of ourselves. To market the platform, we knew it was best to grow organically and so we were looking for ways to achieve this. We decided to try blogging, writing and profiling about Africa’s Young Talented Filmmakers, news on festivals, etc. This turned out to be very successful. We started seeing our traffic grow gradually. In a few months, we were seeing an average of 1000 views on some of our short films. Now, I know 1000 views look really small compared to other kinds of contents on other video platforms but from experience, we have learned that a short film that gets even as low as 500 views is commendable.  Our main marketing strategy was blogging mostly. Attending and sponsoring award categories at film festivals in Cameroun and Nigeria. ‍"," You can visit my FB or LinkedIn account.

106,hubstaff," Introduce yourself and what you built. What's your name, age, where are you based? My name is Dave Nevogt, I am 38 years old and I live in Indianapolis, Indiana. I have built a number of different businesses but my most recent venture is Hubstaff, a software that helps organizations track time. ‍ Explain Hubstaff at a high level. What is it? Hubstaff is a time tracking software that helps people from all industries reduce waste and increase productivity within their organization. It provides a clear picture of what exactly is going on within your team, helping you understand what everyone is doing and providing the tools to keep everyone on track ‍ What's your title? What's your job duties right now in at Hubstaff? I am the CEO of Hubstaff. I spend most of my time on high-level planning with my team, supporting the team in getting things done, building corporate culture and recruiting new team members. ‍ What's your business model? We are a SaaS, customers are billed on a monthly basis based on the number of team members in their organization. We offer a Solo Lite package for single users, a Basic package with all the base features and a Premium package with all the basic features plus some. ‍",," Challenges you have faced in the process of building and growing Hubstaff. One of the biggest challenges we faced while building and growing Hubstaff was the technology, it’s very complex. We have one of the strongest platforms for time tracking in existence which is a great feeling and we’ve built it with a relatively small team but it was a very challenging software to build. ‍ The obstacles you have had with Hubstaff. The biggest obstacle I’ve faced as an entrepreneur is figuring out where to place my resources, it’s kind of like a game of chess. I really enjoy the challenges of entrepreneurship but I’ve realized over time that it takes a lot of guts to go through with when you have a family and employees that are counting on you.   Obstacles and challenges in your personal life, while building your business. The biggest challenge in my personal life has been creating a work/life balance. It’s easy to get caught up in work, especially when your office is at home. I’ve learned that sometimes I have to disconnect and unplug. My goal has been to create a team that is equipped to answer questions and solve problems for themselves so that I can achieve a work/life balance that in the end will make me a better entrepreneur because of it.    Mistakes you, or your team, have committed. The biggest mistake we made was offering a free plan. In the beginning, we thought this would bring in quick and constant revenue but in the end, we realized there was no benefit to this method. Free plans take up resources and don’t necessarily attract future customers but rather people who are merely interested in a free product. If we were to do it all over again, we never would have offered the free plan.   Did you make any mistakes that cost you time and/or money? What were they? Spending time and money on developing the wrong features is a huge mistake. I’ve since learned to make sure that we are spending time on features that our customers are going to use every day.   Things that could have been made in a better way. Customer feedback is the most important thing and simple surveys can provide you with so much information. Looking back, we would have done a survey or relied on direct feedback before moving forward on a new feature. ‍",,," My personal disadvantages. My personal disadvantage is that I refuse to spend all my time working. I hate to say it because it’s not necessarily a bad thing but it can be a disadvantage when comparing yourself to other people.   The disadvantages of your team or anyone who has helped you somehow to build Hubstaff. Being a remote company has many advantages but there are also a few disadvantages. It would be nice to have the ability to get the team together in person, not only would it make collaboration easier but it would also help build a sense of community and culture. These are things that take extra time and effort when working remotely.   Disadvantages in the market of Hubstaff. I can’t really answer this question because I’m not quite sure where we fit into the market yet - still figuring it out five years later.   Disadvantages you have, in comparison with your competitors. There are no major disadvantages that stand out other than the fact that “time” is not in our name which would help when it comes to SEO."," From when you got started until you went live, explain the process in detail. My co-founder, Jared Brown and I started building Hubstaff in 2013. We first developed the applications and made them completely free. We wanted to get a real sense of what our customers had to say and measure the demand for our SaaS. Testing our concept was key to launching a successful startup, we needed to put the time and effort into the concept in order to shape the company’s direction down the road. Once we gathered enough feedback we decided it was time to launch our paid platform. ‍ How long did the process take? The entire process took about 10 months.   Who was involved? In the very beginning, we had two developers and myself doing the marketing.   What resources/tools did you use? The concept was based entirely on the past experiences of myself and my co-founder. We took the knowledge gained previously and put it into action for the development of Hubstaff.   How did the initial product look? The initial product looked really bad, it was very small and only performed a few actions - basic time tracking and screenshots of the team members. We’ve come a long way since then. ‍ What sorts of doubts did you have when starting? The biggest doubt we had when starting was getting the desktop application to run without any bugs. Like any software development, there is a level of trial and error but we wanted to roll out a product that was free of any major glitches.   Did you run into any obstacles in this process? What did you do to overcome them? The biggest obstacle we encountered was getting the bugs ironed out among all the operating systems - this was no easy task.   Did you enjoy the process of getting started/building it? Building Hubstaff was the greatest challenge of my professional career but it was also the most exciting. It was so rewarding to see the increase in demand and people actually using the product. That being said, there was a ton of testing that was required and that was not a ton of fun.   How did you approach pricing your product? In the beginning, we offered a generous free plan but we realized that this business model didn’t make sense for a SaaS company like ourselves. We learned that free plans cost more money than they make and that if people value your product, they’re likely willing to pay for it. We looked in the marketplace to get a better understanding of what others were selling for and we asked our users what they valued the product at. As we continue to improve Hubstaff we re-evaluate our pricing accordingly because we feel it is important to price your software according to the overall value it offers your customers.   Did you launch/publicize your product in any way? If so, how did that go? Did it go as expected? We didn’t launch or publicize our product other than releasing to the database of users that we had built up over time.",," What's your background? What part of your background defines you, and possibly led to starting Hubstaff? I grew up always thinking that the best route was the one with no risk (completely the opposite of what I believe now) so after graduating college with a degree in finance I accepted a corporate finance job in Chicago thinking this was just the next move to make. This is where the road to Hubstaff begins. After 18 months of being cramped in a small cubicle and commuting two hours to and from work every day, I realized this was not the path for me. I quit my job and built my first online business where I sold instructional golf material. I loved what I was doing and was finding great success in it, so much so that I thought it would be a good idea to scale the business and rent an office - it seemed like the next logical step. I realized shortly after being back in an office that this was in fact not the right move for me and all those feelings I felt in a corporate office came rushing back. The freedom I once enjoyed from my online business was dwindling as the responsibilities of managing an office and employees became more prevalent. Eventually, the stress and lack of freedom were too much and I decided to sell the business in 2009, it was a good run but I was ready to move on to something new. After I sold the golf business I was given the opportunity to buy into an SEO company. I was excited about this new opportunity since I’ve always had an interest in software but never had the experience. One of the things that really attracted me to this opportunity was that it was remote, my office could be anywhere I wanted it to be. I learned a lot during this time but one of the most important things - and ultimately the thing that lead me to where I am today, was how to manage a remote team. I learned that a good project management software was key to running a productive and successful team. I left the SEO business after a few years and decided I was ready to create something of my own, it was at this time I truly realized the benefits of a good time tracking software. I saw how important this kind of software was to me and believed that others most likely have this same need and that’s how Hubstaff was born. ‍ Before Hubstaff, what were you doing? Working, school, traveling? What were you focused on professionally? This question goes hand-in-hand with the previous one. Before Hubstaff I started a few online businesses (e-commerce and software) and ran them for about 9 years before starting Hubstaff. The other businesses were successful but Hubstaff has become the largest venture to date. ‍ If you had any failed and/or previous ideas or businesses, it is great to talk about them and how they molded your decisions. My first online business was a golf business where I created and sold training material such as DVDs and books. At first, I was the only person in this specific niche but eventually, the competition began to arise. My brand was not strong enough to keep competition out and although competition means you have a good idea, my brand wasn’t at the level where it could maintain the monopoly. On top of growing competition, the advertising market was also changing at a rapid pace and prices for ad space was continuing to rise. As difficult as it can be to see a business fail, this particular experience taught me so much and I was able to take what I learned, especially about myself, and carry that with me in future business decisions. ‍ Did any big life events lead to starting Hubstaff? There wasn’t a specific life event that lead me to start Hubstaff, in fact, it was quite the opposite. It was a series of events, trial, and error if you will, that lead me to where I am today. ‍ How did the idea come to you? The idea of Hubstaff was born out of my own personal pain points from managing a remote team. I came to realize that a good project management software was crucial to a successful remote business and when I was still with the SEO company we tried out several but never found anything that had all the features we were looking for. I started thinking up ways of how a SaaS could help manage remote teams, I decided to focus on time tracking with management aspects. I wanted the software to integrate with different project management and payroll systems so that eventually it would become the hub for your remote staff - and that’s how the name Hubstaff came to be. ‍ How has the original idea grown and changed over time? The original idea of Hubstaff was to provide managers with the ability to understand what their team is working on without the constant need for follow up. Over time we’ve continued to work on growing our software and making it the best it can possibly be. We’ve also listened to what our customers have to say since their feedback is the most important. Now, Hubstaff has grown into a general time tracking application that helps companies of all shapes and sizes streamline their business processes.   What were your motivations to build Hubstaff? I knew that I wasn’t the only person trying to figure out the best and most efficient way to manage their remote team. I felt there was a lot of value that Hubstaff could provide to other business owners that were building remote teams and I understood their problems deeply. I knew that this was a product that they would get a lot of value from on a daily basis. ‍"," If you could talk to your former self before Hubstaff, what would you tell him? If I could talk to my former self before Hubstaff, I would tell myself to only develop features that people need. I would also give myself a heads up that building a desktop software is very hard.   What do you wish you spent more time on in the beginning? I wish we spent more time on branding and hiring. Looking back, if we would have given these things a little extra time we may have avoided some setbacks in the beginning.   What do you wish you spent less time on in the beginning? I wish we spent less time testing in the beginning.   Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous? As I’ve mentioned before, customer feedback has always been number one. Hearing directly from the people who use our software on a daily basis has been extremely helpful when it comes to building a software that others will want to use. ‍"," Since launching your product, what have you done to grow Hubstaff? Since launching Hubstaff five years ago, we’ve been working hard to make our product the best it can possibly be. We’ve built a skilled and knowledgeable customer support team that listens to customer feedback which gives us the opportunity to create a product that meets our customer’s needs. Hiring the right people for our team has also been key when it comes to growing our company, we take time to hire people that are extremely knowledgeable in their area of expertise and once we hire them on there is a detailed onboarding process they must go through. Having a team that knows what they are doing is key to a successful business and we credit our strong team for the growth Hubstaff has seen. Branding has also been very important when it comes to growing our company, it has helped guide us in our decision-making process and we continue to refine it as we grow. ‍ What tactics worked? SEO, word of mouth and content were the top three tactics that worked for us. Content and SEO go hand-in-hand and we knew early on that a blog would be beneficial to getting our name out there. We produced regular content and made sure it was keyword based. We wrote about topics like time tracking, outsourcing, and screenshots which helped lead customers to our website. Word of mouth was also beneficial when it came to obtaining new clients. People that were led to us through the blog were telling others about us which really helped us grow. ‍ How did you employ/approach these tactics? We knew that hiring employees who were specialists in these areas was key when it came to pursuing growth. We never rushed in to hiring someone but rather took the time to find the right person for the job. It was important to us (and still is) that we find people who are experts in a specific area.   What didn't work? One tactic that didn’t work for us is paid advertising, it never really worked and I don’t know why - I wish I did.   When did you start to see traction? How did that feel? We started seeing traction from our free program almost immediately which felt awesome. Seeing such positive feedback so early on was the motivation behind sticking with the work of building. ‍ Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous? Word of mouth has been particularly advantageous for us. The biggest thing is that people love the product and appreciate the way we do business, if they’re happy with that they’ll spread the word. ‍"," You should visit Hubstaff website here.

107,hyperstarter," Thank you for the interview. My name is Giles Dawe, I’m 40 and am the owner of Hyperstarter which is based in the UK and China. Previously I was semi-retired in Hong Kong, working as a fine artist, selling my paintings to film directors and those who didn’t have to work for a living. My full-time work now is Hyperstarter, a web-based analytics tool that gives advice on how to make a Kickstarter campaign successful. We help at all stages of a crowdfunding campaign, in an industry that raises more money than venture capital. Since 2016 we’ve raised an additional $6m for campaign owners, working on over 300 campaigns and are ranked in the Top 9 Kickstarter Marketing Agencies in the World by Crowdcrux. We even started to write a guide on Kickstarter marketing, teaching everything we know about it. On average we’re making about $5000 a month, but last month we made close to $10,000 by closing some new work with campaign owners. ‍",," As I’m reading through this interview, it seems everything was great and I was moving from one job to another. In reality, there was no support network around to bounce off ideas or to bring others onboard. The majority of my working life has been remote working in Asia, usually from home by myself, bootstrapping and having the difficulty of facing a work/life balance whilst spending time working out what I should be doing. Being based in China and running an internet business was hard. The majority of popular sites from Google, Facebook, Twitter were blocked in the country so I had to find alternatives to use. My daily routine isn’t healthy either, with hours ranging from 9 am to 1am on most weekdays. In terms of the niche of crowdfunding, Kickstarter has a bad reputation. Even if the campaign owner reaches their goal and successfully funds, it doesn’t mean backers will receive their product on time (or if at all!). Right now 160 new campaigns per day are added to the Kickstarter platform, but if the problem persists combined with a low 30% success rate I can see entrepreneurs finding non-crowdfunding ways to raise finance in the near future.    The biggest mistake is not launching Version 2 of Hyperstarter. We could have launched 1 year ago, but instead, refinements and changes have delayed the launch. Right now, it’s not so urgent as the site is automated and it’s bringing in regular sales per week. Version 2 has the possibility of bringing in dozens of automated sales per day, so between working on campaigns per day or working on V2, we need to work on our own site ASAP. We could have captured emails better at the beginning. Previously, users could run their Kickstarter URL and then after they didn’t know what to do next. We implemented a free downloadable PDF report, in exchange for an email address which works very well in collecting emails for our newsletters. ‍",,," Before, my major disadvantage was my location. The majority of our customers were based in the US or Europe, so I was 8 to 12 hours ahead of them. This meant I had to have phone calls in the early morning, at times when I wasn’t 100% concentrating on what I was saying! I’m involved in every aspect of the Hyperstarter site and in each campaign we work on. It’s become easier over time, as we’ve kept notes on what worked for campaigns and what didn’t work but right now I’m not able to give up control. Compared to our competitors, we don’t use Facebook ads and so we’re not making as much as them. The majority of our competitors charge a fixed fee and a % of all adverts that bring in sales, which for a single campaign could bring in a 6 figure commission. The reason we use an upfront fee and not commission is all about trust. As we’re UK based and not in the same country as the majority of our clients, an international contract isn’t easily enforceable. The worry of if/when we would be paid isn’t something I want to be involved in, which relates to my freelance work years ago with clients. We’re passing up on a lot of money, but the risk isn’t worth it."," The live version you see right now was built within a month. It was designed and coded in-house by myself and a few individuals I’ve known over the years. Hyperstarter has a team of 4 where we all work remotely, with the majority of team members coming from China. The site itself was inspired by Google’s homepage and online checkers that suggest how web pages can be improved. As we’re targeting Kickstarter campaign owners, we put a single form box in the center of the page for people to run their existing Kickstarter URL. I just wanted to build it and then work out how to make money later. My thinking was if someone’s using my tool for free, then I’ve already got “my foot in the door” and can start to gain the user’s trust. Often users on our site send over a message of “what else can you do for me” and this is how we make revenue, but it wasn’t something I thought about whilst building the site. We launched in April 2016 officially, but having previously worked on Kickstarter projects beforehand I asked all my contacts and campaign owners (who liked what we did for them!) to support our launch. We launched on ProductHunt only, having prepared weeks in advance but due to the time differences, we weren’t able to be featured on the popular newsletter in time. In summary, as an alternative to paid (Facebook) ads, what we do is very time consuming but effective. Our pricing is available on the Hyperstarter submit page where we can offer a listing on our platform or “hands-on” work which can consist of PR outreach, looking at who they should be connecting with and pitching. Obstacles we continually face are mainly based around Kickstarter and trust, which I will explain in detail later on.",," My background is creative, as I studied painting at the University of Wales and at L’ecole de Nantes, France. I realized earlier on in my 20’s that having a degree in fine art wasn’t useful and I was supplementing my income by working on the checkout of a local supermarket and buying and selling Nintendo 64’s on eBay. Around the year 1999, the web was reaching its peak and I learned web design fairly quickly. I got a job working on ThisIsBristol, a local news portal connected with the Daily Mail group. I worked there for 3 months, learning as much as I could before moving over to a UK based Government agency, working there for 2 years as the head of web design and development. Speaking to the bosses, we both agreed that I should leave the company. The role was very well paid and I had the responsibility of traveling to London frequently to speak with top Government staff to working on the £4.5m Planning Portal. I had itchy feet and felt I could do a lot more if I worked for myself. I decided to move to Hong Kong to live with my partner, where I did a lot of freelance work and also made good money from buying and selling websites and domains. Freelancing was tough, so I made my own websites making money from sponsorships, Ask (Jeeves) and Google Adsense. As Hong Kong is predominantly full of millionaires, I built up my social network and started to create custom paintings and get represented by galleries. At this stage, I didn’t get many failures in the web work I was doing and ended up moving to China in 2006. In the years from 2004-2008, it seemed people had a lot more disposable income. I remember selling the Mobiles.org.nz domain name for close to $3000! Now the value of this domain would be around $50. My biggest life event at this point is that I became a full-time father and stopped working for about 4 years, relying on income from my websites. Later as my son was in full-time education, I was able to restart my work and get rid of the sites that didn’t generate much income because Google changed their Adsense terms. In 2015 I created Gifts and Coupons which listed all the latest, cool gifts you can buy. It was the type of site I wanted to visit, as I found it hard to find great presents. I started to get messages from people with crowdfunding campaigns who wanted to be on the site, but as they weren’t things you could physically buy I turned them away. The requests became so frequent that I looked into crowdfunding and Kickstarter, which is the biggest rewards-based platform. I saw that only 30% of all crowdfunding campaigns were successful and reached their goal! I thought I could help and built Hyperstarter, which focuses on the campaign page first for free and then offers additional paid services from promotion on the site to “hands-on” work. ‍"," I think I’ve learned a lot over time, from don’t be stubborn and ask for help if you need it to connect with as many people as you can, if you’re looking for new leads. I wish I contacted influencers earlier on and made better leverage of the high net worth individuals I knew from my time in Hong Kong. I also think you should enjoy what you’re doing, where in previous years I hated some of the web work I was involved in. I really enjoy the work I’m doing now, as each project is different and we generally work 1 to 3 days on improving a campaign only. I do worry where the next clients are coming from, but that can easily be fixed if we start to use ads or outreach more often. Right now as our clients are all coming to us organically and reaching out to us first.  "," My strategy for Hyperstarter was different than all the other businesses I worked on. I didn’t want to spend time boasting about how great we are or the same self-promoting BS you hear from every other marketer. I wanted direct traceable references and get others to write about how great we were. To find customers, I joined different crowdfunding forums and offered my advice to campaign owners for free. They saw what I wrote, got in touch and I initially lowered my prices to get involved in these projects just to gain some experience. Compared to my competitors I wanted customers to know that we at Hyperstarter are approachable and trustworthy. Sure, collecting money is great but we wanted to provide real value and we care about our clients, our references reflect that. Within the space of 2 years, we’ve been instrumental in the success of the British Invention of the Year, Virgin Voom Runner-up to the nearly $900,000 raised Neck Hammock. I’d say 95% of our business comes from referrals and messages from our site. The rest of our business comes from direct tweets or emails to campaign owners based on similar successful campaigns we worked on (whilst showing them the references at the same time). This tactic works very well and we have a great reputation on forums, Trustpilot, and our website. One of the advantages I’d say Hyperstarter has over others is that we work closely with our clients, but we’ve also connected with our closest competitors too. I think Hyperstarter is part of a small inner circle of crowdfunding companies that in some ways can work together on a campaign, as we all bring our own unique set of skills to the table. ‍"," Feel free to contact me on the Hyperstarter site.

108,imaginovation," Hello! My name is Michael Georgiou, and I am a Co-Founder and CMO at Imaginovation. We are an award-winning technology and app development company based out of Raleigh, NC.  At Imaginovation, we provide custom enterprise-grade technology solutions to a variety of businesses in any industry, from funded startups to Fortune 500 companies. Our services include building custom web applications, mobile apps, and emerging technologies such as AI development, IoT development, AR & VR app development, and blockchain development.  Currently, I look after and manage all the marketing and branding initiatives of our company, including digital and offline marketing. The majority of my time goes into creating marketing and sales strategies, meeting with potential clients, developing partnership programs and lead our digital marketing team.  ‍",," Being an entrepreneur is not easy. You have to make a lot of sacrifices and fight your way through some of the toughest obstacles in order to see your business flourish. We didn't know much about entrepreneurship when we started, but we learned things through tons of trial and error and consistent hard work. Not knowing anything about how to build a business was the biggest challenge for us. But, as I look back now, I must say that it was actually a blessing in disguise. Pete and I literally put our sweat, blood, and tears into growing the company, and I mean “literally”. The emotional, physical, and mental struggles that we faced were imperative to our success, but we persevered and never gave up.  A good example was Pete losing his firstborn child, who was a beautiful premie baby that couldn’t hold on any longer after about seven weeks or so. During that time it was incredibly challenging because Pete had to step away from his traditional work hours, and I had to step in and take on a lot of that workload.  The lack of sleep and stress during the years caused us to get sick continuously while also working because we had no choice but to continue to work, taking a very little vacation, and times of heavy anxiety were frequent during the mountains of challenges that were in front of us.  However, as business partners and brothers-in-law, we balanced out each other, picked one another up when the other was down on the ground, worked together, stayed positive, trusted, and made big things happen.  Some of the biggest mistakes/poor decisions we made are the following: Not taking our time, patience, and process to hire correctly. We hired way too quickly sometimes.Taking too long to let employees go that were harming our business or weren’t a good fit.We hired new employees based on the assumption that new sales and revenue was going to be generated in the near future. Do not play “the role of God” and assume new deals will close, and allowing yourself to go on a hiring spree. Only hire based on your current financial situation, comfort level, and monthly cash flow. Project cash flow is good to be mindful of, but it shouldn’t be used to determine when to hire new people.We kept working with clients that were harmful to our business because of financial desperation sometimes but hurt us in the long-run. Sometimes you have to let your clients go and part ways, it will benefit both parties.When times were great financially, from time to time we neglected the smaller potential clients. Sometimes these smaller clients are your bread and butter, this is something to really be aware of. In the later years, we scaled too quickly regarding the size of our team and newly incurred expenses, and sales were difficult to catch up. We let our emotions take over, stress us out, and not make the best business decisions. It’s important to not be emotionless, but in a sense not let your emotions and personal feelings dictate your business decisions.At times we tried to focus on too many different things, trying to do too much, which tends to clutter up the organization of other effective strategies, processes, and tasks at hand. Stay focused and don’t try to take on more than you can handle, as it can negatively impact your growth and create confusion within the company, and ultimately cause delays in achieving your goals.  ",," Currently, we are a seven-figure business (yearly), but we aim to make Imaginovation worth $5-7 million by 2022. And I know that we can definitely achieve this goal as we are continuously expanding our services, client-base, and growing our boutique brand in the tech market.  At the moment, we are a team of 35+ people and we aim to add more developers, designers and project managers in the next 6 to 12 months.   In addition, we aim to continue working with growing small businesses, funded startups, and large enterprise brands to develop innovative applications that will help them internally as well as their customers.  Eventually, we would like to niche out to a certain target audience, industry, and maybe a type of technology. However, at the moment we essentially can work on projects that fit the type of client we want to work with on a personality level and who meets our budget expectations.  From a product perspective, we do have plans to build our own SaaS products that incorporate a mobile/web app with artificial intelligence that help solve a problem or pain point. Many times in the past, we’ve already got into developing our own products to sell, but unfortunately had to put them on hold because client work took priority.  For my personal business goals, I plan on building a personal brand with business storytelling along with also growing my podcast called Tales from the PROS. This is a storytelling podcast in which I personally interview business and thought leaders around the world sharing their stories of success, struggle, and obstacles they overcame. ‍",," We started our company from NOTHING. Yes, Imaginovation is a 100% organically bootstrapped company that started with a simple Craigslist ad. We built Imaginovation through hard work and dedication.  Since we didn’t have any funds in the beginning, we would often post on Craigslist and try different types of free advertising to promote our business. It helped us get a few leads but that wasn't enough.  We were still struggling very hard to keep our business up and running. Pete had to continue working and hustling at two jobs (Imaginovation and SAS) for almost five years since the inception of the company.    We didn't have the funds to hire people too. So, it was a continuous process to learn and improve things on our own and handle many aspects of the company such as sales, marketing, project management, account management, finance, design, and more.  I still remember how we would often take crazy initiative, learn, and do things. We have spent several sleepless nights with our team to meet our clients' expectations and meet very tight project deadlines, in addition to working incredibly hard (10-15 hours a day) trying to grow and scale the company on many fronts.  As we started to grow in revenue, we took the smallest salaries possible and poured everything back into the business to scale up the operations, increase the team size and promote our services more heavily.  I would say one of the best things we did to grow Imaginovation on a revenue perspective was to drastically improve and execute our digital marketing strategies such as SEO, social media, and content marketing, along with attending networking events and tapping into our referral networks (friends, family, etc.). The second best thing we did was get very hungry, passionate, and aggressive on the sales side which allowed us to close several small and large deals.  In addition to all those things, Pete and I worked very hard to improve our tech talent which enabled us to perform and produce for our clients, gain positive reviews, and grow our portfolio as well as our credibility in the market over time.",," It all started back in 2011. I had finished my Master's degree in Australia and came back to the US. But, I didn't have a job as the Great Recession of 2008 had just ended, and the economy was still in bad shape.  My business partner and CEO of Imaginovation, Pete Peranzo was working at SAS, at that time, but he wanted to do something bigger, and build something of his own. Pete and I met through one of our mutual friends years before, but little did we know that we would become such great friends and then 50/50 business partners.   Pete knew that there's a hidden entrepreneur inside me. One day, very randomly though, Pete called me and asked if I want to start a company. ""Wait. What?"" I was both excited, confused and very anxious to know his idea.  I always had this dream of starting my own business, and put my marketing and creative skills to work. So I was more than excited to implement Pete’s idea, but there was a hitch. None of us knew how to build a business.  Pete and I were determined to start a technology company helping other businesses with their websites and applications. Some of Pete's friends, who were software developers and web developers, and also jobless at that time, were happy to join us. They were ready to work for free for a few months until we were able to close some business.  We came together and decided to set up a full-service web and mobile app development company to help businesses achieve their true potential through innovative technology as well as solve their internal pain points.  We started mulling over the company name, and I thought a great slogan for our company would be ""Imagination turns innovation,"" and the name ""Imaginovation"" quickly popped in our mind. In fact, it was a dream I had the night before, so it felt like fate, to be honest.  This is how Imaginovation came to existence.  "," If I get a chance to meet my former self before Imaginovation, I would say this: Make sure your idea and concept is something that reflects what you are really good at, such as your skillset, capabilities, and strengths. Most importantly it needs to reflect your life’s purpose, and in my personal opinion, your purpose should be driven and derived by your passion.  Be prepared for a huge task list, of course, this should come after you have created a well thought out business plan, and ensure you complete and execute one task at a time.  As entrepreneurs, you would want to get a thousand things done at once, and many times it becomes so overwhelming that you see an Mt. Everest of issues and tasks to complete, which becomes incredibly stressful.  So, to unclutter your mind, and take it one task at a time, and one day at a time. Make sure you set goals for you and your team to achieve and create weekly tasks that are realistic to be completed.  As you start to see progress internally, you will start to see progress externally such as generating new leads, closing new deals, building long-term relationships, and scaling your business. ‍"," Since the very beginning, our aim is to build and improve our brand value and recognition. As stated earlier, we aggressively promoted our services through Craigslist ads and other free business directories at the start.  We would also reach out to hundreds of people every day through emails, and as time went one, we started getting some qualified leads that lead to clients. Those were the leads that helped us kick-start and essentially grow our business.  We would brainstorm and figure out ways to provide value to all the leads in order to grow our portfolio, clientele, and trust and credibility in this over-saturated market.  We also attended many local events in Raleigh, Cary, Charlotte, and Durham to connect with potential leads and prospects. Reaching out to local businesses digitally and in-person helped us build momentum, give us a face, and build a presence around our local area.  When we had a handful of projects after the first six months, we decided to drastically enhance our website and start marketing it across North Carolina. We developed our website, setup the social channels, and started posting helpful and insightful blogs every week, and socializing them.  Our primary focus was building an SEO-optimized website that would help us establish a valuable and credible online presence. I used to research, read, and chat for several hours with my friends and online marketing experts, trying to understand SEO, PPC, content marketing, social media ads, and whatnot. I have also spent countless hours learning Google algorithms, Google trends, and analyzing top service providers and competitors in our domain.  The learning and analysis allowed us to create SEO-friendly content for our website and improve competitive Google rankings organically over time.

109,impossible," My name is Joel Runyon. I’m an endurance athlete and entrepreneur and founder at IMPOSSIBLE.  IMPOSSIBLE is a performance lifestyle company focused on helping people push their limits and do the impossible. There are several components to it. First, there’s the blog, IMPOSSIBLE, and the impossible list where I share lessons and inspiration about pushing your limits.  Impossible Fitness has exercise tutorials, videos, and training programs to help people do various fitness challenges on their impossible lists. There’s also the Impossible Gear site - which is our eCommerce component selling performance apparel + supplements - along with our famous impossible shirt. One of our core values is making it possible for others to push their limits as well - so we started Impossible.org to give back and help students and entrepreneurs do just that. However, in addition to IMPOSSIBLE, we have several sister businesses including a meal planning app, a mobility exercise coaching app, and a free blog setup service.  I also advise and invest in a small number of health, fitness, and productivity-focused startups. ",," With IMPOSSIBLE, we’ve had no limit to people copying our brand, steal domain names, and even straight-up copying our logo. It’s been a massive headache, but something that I’ve come out the other side with a huge trial-by-fire knowledge base and I try to use it to help other entrepreneurs avoid the same headaches I’ve had to deal with. Business-wise, one of my biggest mistakes was overinvesting in the content on our Ultimate Paleo Guide site and not investing enough in marketing the content we did have. you can call this going “wide” instead of “deep” - which I wish we would have done sooner. For example - our beginner’s paleo guide and recipe section are hugely popular - we built out tons and tons of recipes, but we could probably have done half the content and twice the promotion. Also - when we moved from manual meal plans to our meal planning app - we took on a MASSIVE technical challenge + upgrade. We should have done this in smaller steps rather than biting off a big chunk in one go. When you find something - jump on it - we’ve found great success with our stretching pages and mewing guides on MoveWell so we’re doubling down on those.  One of the good things about having multiple sites is we can quickly learn from our mistakes + correctly quickly. For example, when we saw how well MoveWell was doing, we built out ImpossibleFitness.com in a similar way so we could scale up much faster and reach more people. ",," Going forward, My main goal is to focus 100% on IMPOSSIBLE and own / advise on everything else. With IMPOSSIBLE, we’ve firmed up our product offerings, are rolling out more fitness programs focused on people’s goals while completely overhauling all of our impossible gear inventory + offerings (and we just got on Amazon). The impossible shirt and the impossible list continue to be the base and inspiration for hundreds of thousands of people to push their limits and do the impossible. It’s so cool to see people finally go do the thing they’ve been talking about doing while wearing their impossible gear. We are building out more custom performance gear and fuel and are excited to launch both this year.  For all the sister projects - our nutrition content businesses, meal planner, mobility exercise app, and blogging site - I’m moving more into an ownership role and spending less time personally on them.  I want to do more investing + advising as I’ve done for LMNT electrolytes and other brands. I also want to spend more time doing more fun adventures. A few things on my impossible list this year are spending the time to learn to kitesurf and other epic running projects if travel starts to open back up (fingers crossed). ",," My first product at IMPOSSIBLE was because I wanted to get six-pack abs and do a photoshoot. Vain as hell, but hey - it was a fun idea. I did that, did a dope photoshoot in an abandoned building outside Chicago, and then got asked a bunch of questions about how I did it. I realized people are interested in what you do, but they’ll pay you to teach them how to do it. So, I quickly made a product around it. In the product, I talked about Intermittent fasting and the paleo diet. This was in 2012 as paleo was about to blow up. I got so many questions about it - that I built a one-page guide to answer all the questions I had gotten. That site began to get so much traffic that we put up ads & affiliate links to pay for the hosting. Slowly that business grew on its own, spun out into its own company, and evolved to include keto, carnivore, and other real-food, low carb diets, an award-winning paleo app, and a meal planning tool. Meanwhile, as IMPOSSIBLE expanded, I set out to run an ultra marathon on every continent to raise funds for charity. On race #1, I got dramatically injured and had to rehab myself back to health through physical therapy. That led me to create a mobility exercise coaching app - MoveWell. Now, Impossible is evolving. We’ve spun our fitness content over into exercise demonstrations, tutorials, and goal-focused programs at Impossible Fitness. We have our e-commerce products (apparel right now, but performance fuel coming soon). Our Impossible Shirt is by far our best-seller. Our process is usually something along the lines of “experiment with a few things, see what people are interested in, and then build a product around that.” It seems to be working well so far!",," I started IMPOSSIBLE originally as a blog to be an impetus to do something interesting with my life. I was sitting at home, living in my parents’ basement - watching a ton of Netflix and wishing I could do something in my life worth writing about. I had done everything you were supposed to do - but graduating in the middle of the 2009 recession meant I was doing temp jobs at UPS and wondering “is this it?” Was it all worth it?  Everything seemed impossible for me so I turned to the internet. I saw people like Sean Ogle quit their job, move to Thailand and start side quests like going to the top 100 bars in the world. Chris Guillebeau was traveling to every country in the world. I wanted the freedom to do any of that, but it all seemed unrealistic for someone like me. I made a list - but it all seemed so preposterously impossible that I called it an impossible list. That said, after one time of going through it and realizing that there was one thing on the list I didn’t have an excuse for - running a triathlon. I didn’t know anything about triathlons, but I signed up, trained for it, and did it. I realized at the end of it - that I spent so much time telling myself I couldn’t do stuff and I just did one of them! What else could I do if I just went for it? I decided to take on harder challenges - longer races, better jobs, and eventually starting my own business - all while writing about it.  The writing kept me accountable and then I realized that people were not just interested in the stories, but they wanted to do it themselves. That let me start sharing my experiences, showing how I went about something, and then turning it into different products (which then let me do more things). "," Get your fundamentals straight. I hate stuff like accounting, legal, and all the minutiae that comes with the business, but after dealing with lawsuits, an audit, and a bunch of other stuff - it’s better to have everything locked up and loaded than be caught with your pants down. Life is way less stressful when you have a lawyer, a bookkeeper, and a CPA that you trust and know your business. Product matters. What problem are you solving? Answer that first. Then build the product from there. So many people build things that are a solution in search of a problem.  Build the audience first. If you’re going to spend a ton of time building a product, you might as well spend half that time first to build an audience. You’ll probably find out a ton of stuff that you didn’t know and they might even point you in a better direction. Plus, when you do launch - you’ll have a built-in set of supporters rather than having to go dig up a bunch of buyers after the fact. This is very on-brand, but the biggest thing I’ve learned from IMPOSSIBLE is that you have no idea what you’re capable of. I would have never guessed that starting a blog in my parent’s basement would take me to every continent in the world and become one of 7 people to run an ultra marathon on every continent. Don’t disqualify yourself before you start. Find out what you want and then go for it."," IMPOSSIBLE Over the years with IMPOSSIBLE, I have done hundreds of interviews, guest blogs, and podcast interviews. The primary way that I’ve grown has been acting like a human to other people and trying to help their businesses. We’ve seen tremendous growth through organic channels like SEO, but a HUGE portion of the impossible audience comes organically via social and through things like the impossible list - which we’ve had thousands of people go on to create their own. We’re continuing to invest in “sticky” marketing that grabs people’s attention and inspires them to push their limits - specifically with video + photos.  MoveWell MoveWell primarily grew from my existing IMPOSSIBLE email list. Over time, it’s garnered its own small cult following in the recovery space and we’re continuing to push on that as we create more and more useful content. Our organic marketing has started to take off recently with some posts like our mewing and stretches databases doing very well.  Ultimate Meal Plans + Ultimate Paleo Guide These businesses sort of grew on their own. At first, I thought they would be a very similar audience as IMPOSSIBLE - but their demographics skew very differently. It turns out most of our traffic is organic - either through search or social and skew heavily female.  Our meal planning app has become quite the standout lately and we’re going to be rolling out an affiliate program to help us scale up even faster soon. ‍"," You can follow me on my site and search for @joelrunyon on Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube."," A Blog - I recommend everyone start a blog. I built a beginner’s blogging guide and even built a standalone niche site - startablog.com - to help people set up their own (for free). I find that publicly blogging has been one of the best ways to connect with other people throughout the process. When people ask how I’ve made connections or know other people doing things - my answer usually boils down to “about 10 years of connecting with different people online.” Somehow that’s never the “quick trick” that people are looking for, but it’s true. Ulysses - I do all my writing in this app. It’s great for markdown, lets me outline ideas or get something blog-ready easily. I can also export directly to WordPress, so that makes things even easier as it eliminates the copy/pasting back & forth. SEOPress - I moved all my sites from Yoast to this plugin recently. I find it’s better, faster, and pushing out updates quicker.  CloudApp - This app saves me so many one-to-one calls and emails with my team. In 30 seconds, I can screen share or create gifs to show someone exactly what I’m talking about instead of “telling.” Around.co - I use this for team calls instead of Zoom. It’s a markedly better experience and I can’t explain why - you just have to try it yourself. Roam Research - I brain dump in this all the time and use it for scratch notes for my day and for organizing book notes. It helps me make connections I didn’t consciously think of before. A Moleskine Notebook - No matter how many apps I use, nothing is a substitute for writing down all the things in a notebook that I want to do in a day and not letting myself go to sleep until I finish all of them.

110,ink," Hey Failory! My name is Andrew Askins, I’m a jack-of-all-trades from Charleston, SC. My story is a little different from many of the others here because our product failed, but our company is still going strong. I started my company Krit with two of my best friends in 2014. At the time I started Krit I was still a full-time student (I was actually studying abroad in Scotland for the first 3 months). It was a strange time because I was running a company but wasn’t legally about to drink in the states.   In 2015 we launched our first product Ink. Ink was a tool that made it super easy for freelancers to create contracts and get them signed online. Users got 3 contracts for free and could then buy packs to get more or a monthly subscription. We got a couple thousand free users, but ultimately got burnt out before we could make the business model work. Along the way, people had started reaching out to us to help them build their products. So, in October of 2015, we shut down Ink and started focusing full-time on consulting. Today, I’m still growing Krit. We’re now completely focused on helping non-technical founders at early stage startups build and launch products of their own (while avoiding the mistakes we made along the way). ‍"," In the end Ink failed because we got burnt out as a team before we were able to make the business model work. We finally launched the public version of Ink on Product Hunt in April of 2015 and shut it down in October of 2015. We had early signs of traction, but the business clearly wasn’t working. We could have experimented with a new market by using our templated contract approach to save lawyers time on routine work. Or we could have tweaked the business model by removing the free contracts. Our competitor Bonsai for a long time gave contracts away completely for free as a loss-leader to sell their other products. But it took us a year and a half to get the first version of Ink out the door. That was a year and a half that we were all making $500 a month. We were exhausted and the code was a mess. We just didn’t have the desire to go through another year and a half to make the business work. ‍"," Our biggest mistake was getting too caught up in the building. We regularly overbuilt the product and didn’t spend enough time marketing and talking to customers. It took us a year and a half to launch Ink, if had started smaller we would have had more time to iterate on the business. We will build more products of our own in the future. And the next time, we won’t build a single thing until we’ve spent at least a month on user interviews. And I mean we, in the early days the whole team needs to be focused on users and their problems above all else.",,,," When we decided to build software to make working with clients easier we had a huge, grand vision. Not enough designers used creative briefs, or clear contracts, so our tool would have both of those. Designers and developers were also bad at communicating, so we would map everything out for clients to the point that the whole project flow was crystal clear. And clients were notorious for taking too long to pay, so we would build an escrow system that would hold the money for the project and automatically dispense it when deliverables were complete. Our system would handle everything. Which is great except: It would have taken years for a team of 3 to build everything we wanted to do.We were trying to change human behavior with software. Don’t try to change human behavior with software. But we were naive and determined. So, we set out to build this massive, world-changing project management tool. Rather than talk to our users to figure out the most painful part of the client project lifecycle, we just started building. Naturally, we started at the beginning, which meant creative briefs and project proposals. The tech was built in Ember.js back when Ember Data was still in beta. So, we were running a production app with an often buggy and not super well-documented data library (fun times). The backend was all PHP (and I believe Laravel) because that was what we had the most experience with. The code base was honestly a nightmare, it was all spaghetti code, we had no documentation, and things were just cobbled together. But, it worked well enough to get us users, so I don’t have any regrets there. As a developer, you should constantly be embarrassed looking back at the code you wrote years ago. After months in buggy beta, we realized the creative brief tool was broken and no one was really using it. So, we decided to change things up. Again, we could have talked to users to figure out what they wanted us to build. But instead, we decided, everyone needs contracts, right? And our proposals are basically contracts. We’re still going to build everything, but let’s go all in on this contract thing for now. So, we created the concept of different products within the larger system and decided the first would be Ink - the ultimate freelance contract tool. We spent several more months in private beta - at this point, we were working out of a co-working space and would show new project changes to people working nearby. So, we were starting to talk to users, but just to show them new product changes, not to truly figure out what they were spending money on (and might spend more on). And finally, we decided the product was good enough and it was time to find out if anyone would pay for it, so we launched on Product Hunt.",," My background is in software engineering. While in college I got a job, I had no business getting. I was one of the first 6 hires at an iOS development shop. I knew almost nothing about iOS development when I started (I didn’t even own a smartphone yet), but I was willing to work for cheap so the founders took a flyer on me. I learned fast and managed to stick around. We were constantly building and launching new products (6 apps in the first two months I was there, and I worked on 5 of them) so I learned a ton. But I immediately knew I wanted to try to build something on my own. Around the same time, some people I knew were starting an accelerator program. They knew my friends and I were trying to start something of our own and had the technical chops to build a product. Because we were in Columbia, SC (where we were living and grew up) their other teams were mostly non-technical founders. So, they gave us a check for $16,000, access to some incredible mentors, and basically told us we could work on whatever we wanted to. When we first started the program we actually wanted to build a Dribbble competitor. I was trying to learn design at the time and was frustrated by how hard it was to find people to give me feedback. But our mentors running the accelerator program encouraged us to start doing user interviews and pushed us to figure out our business model, and we quickly realized there wasn’t much of a business there. In our conversations with designers, the biggest problem we heard basically boiled down to, “working with clients is hard.” So, we decided to try to build software to make working with clients easier. The first product ultimately became Ink. ‍"," I’m going to keep this simple. Here are the things I would do differently next time, boiled down into easy bullet points: Don’t build anything until you know your customer’s pain points inside and out (and have ideally sold something to them).Even if you’re building something for yourself, you are not a replacement for your customers. Talk to customers.When you start building keep the scope small - shoot to have your MVP done in 1-3 months. Keep cutting back on the scope until it feels WAY too small.Spend at least 50% of the entire team’s time on marketing and sales.Pay yourself enough to live off of and take breaks. Don’t work yourself into burnout. ‍"," We didn’t ever have a very coherent marketing strategy. One of the things I tell the non-technical founders we work with these days is that having at least one non-technical founder is actually super important. We were all technical founders - the original team was two developers and one designer. So, we really knew nothing about marketing. We would get heads down working on the product, and then go, “oh right, we need to tell people about this.” Most of our users came from a successful Product Hunt launch, which is a completely unsustainable approach. We had a moderate bit of success with content marketing, but we just never stuck to it consistently enough to build a really strong audience. For current founders, technical or non-technical, find a channel that’s sort of working and stick to it with unrelenting focus. You should be spending at least 50% of your time on sales and marketing - and you need that unrelenting focus because consistency in marketing is key. ‍"," If you’re a non-technical founder and want to learn more about how we help startups build profitable companies you can check out the Krit website. We also have a weekly newsletter full of great advice for founders. Each week has a different topic and is packed with info but designed to be read in 5 minutes or less.   If you enjoyed this interview and want to connect with me the best place is usually Twitter. Or you can also visit our FB group, in which we talk about VR marketing and sales. Thanks for reading, and good luck!"," I’ve got to plug the Krit blog here, because we wouldn’t publish our content if we didn’t think it was valuable. I also love Justin Jackson, Baremetrics, Groove’s blog and Stacking the Bricks. Of all the startup podcasts out there, my favorite lately has been the Indie Hackers podcast.

111,inked-sports," My name is Tyler Shooshani. I’m a Senior (22 years old) at USC studying Business Administration with an emphasis on entrepreneurship. For the past 3 years, I have also been a student manager for the USC football team, where I am responsible for setting up the locker room before practices and games, assembling and assisting drills throughout practice, traveling to away games, warming up the players, and overseeing all football equipment during game days. Currently, I am the co-founder and CEO of my startup Inked Sports, the new influencer marketing and awareness-building platform to help college athletes connect with brands for sponsorship opportunities. The company is based in Los Angeles, California. Our platform is and forever will be free of fees for college athletes. We charge brands a 20% transaction fee on the deal value to help facilitate the entire deal process, from sourcing athletes to sending offers to executing deals to identifying key results on their influencer investments. ‍",," Our main challenge has been executing the development of our tech. I am so proud of all the hard work we put into getting to this point now, it’s just a matter of executing. Through this experience, I’ve learned that developing great software takes a lot of time and resources (money and experience). We are very excited for the day our tech is complete for college athletes and brands to finally receive the whole Inked Sports experience. ‍",," One of my goals for the future is to complete the development of our brands’ web app so we can finally help the 85 athletes (and growing) on our marketplace capitalize on this incredible opportunity. A personal goal would be to dramatically change a college athlete’s life (in a good way, of course) through Inked Sports. I work closely with my other co-founders Nico and Devin. Nico is our CPO and leads the product development of both our athletes app and brands web app. He helped conduct a handful of athlete and brand interviews and developed the UI and UX for both applications.  Devin is our CTO and is the mastermind behind our entire tech development. We are looking forward to giving him a much larger tech team soon, and I’m personally very excited to see Devin’s leadership skills take action.  I handle the day-to-day conversations with athletes and brands, ideate and execute our marketing strategy (with the help of our awesome marketing intern, Shanna!), meet with potential investors, rework and fine-tune our business model, and keep track of all of our legal work. We all come together every week and talk about putting the company in the best position possible to succeed outside of individual roles. We all know we have unique abilities that help us do our respective work, but we always help each other out whenever we can.",," The process was long but very rewarding. We started by gathering as much data as possible by conducting multiple interviews with college athletes and brands. We eventually decided to build a mobile app for athletes and a web app for brands since we believe it is the natural product for both customer bases. College students, in general, use their phones far more often than they use their laptops, and we wanted to make it as easy and accessible as possible for college athletes to utilize their NIL. For brands, we wanted to create a web app that was simple on the front end and complex on the backend so we could create substantial value for brand managers that wish to continue using our product. We even have an internal motto for our brand’s web app: “To make NIL deals as easy as Facebook ads”, and we know through our product development with the joint leadership of the three co-founders that we have accomplished that.  Currently, we only have the athletes’ app launched. Since day one, we have received incredible feedback and love the initial reactions from college athletes. However, the most impactful part of our launch was when other college athletes reached out to us, wanting an opportunity to join the platform. It’s one thing to reach out to a massive set of athletes and have a specific percentage download and make an account, but it’s an entirely different feeling when college athletes you didn’t contact reach out to you and want to be a part of Inked Sports. As a founder, it is the best feeling in the world when your brand organically grows. It’s difficult to put it into words, to be honest. ‍",," As a student manager, I noticed how much time and effort it took to be a student athlete. Most began their days at 6 a.m. working out and going to rehab if they were injured. They’d then rush to class, scarf down lunch, go back to practice, maybe some more class, and then get home when it was already dark out to do their homework. I felt awful for these athletes, as their commitment to their sport took up most if not all of their time to develop professional skills. Additionally and most notably, at the time, the NCAA did not allow college athletes to profit off of their name, image, and likeness (NIL) in any capacity (including starting their own business), which meant most athletes were left with little to zero experience when they graduated. However, an opportunity arose. California announced that by 2024, college athletes in California would be able to profit off of their NIL, combating the NCAA’s amateurism policy. I knew that other states would soon follow, and I sat down and thought to myself, “How could I help college athletes capitalize off of this opportunity with a solution that can scale to all college athletes?” Inked Sports became that solution. Over time, certain parts of Inked Sports changed as my co-founder, Max, and I continued to meet with professors and other business professionals to get their feedback on the idea. But the core concept of helping college athletes for free never changed. We then dove into extensive customer discovery with both athletes and brands to ensure that our product would be designed specifically for the needs of both customer bases. My motivation to build Inked Sports is to help athletes who feel underrepresented feel represented. 98% of college athletes don’t make it to the professional level, leaving 490,000 athletes with little to no interest from agencies that can help them. We built a solution that enables any college athlete to essentially be their agent and manage their NIL opportunities in less than 15 min a day."," Be patient, but act fast. It’s ok for people not to like your idea. That’s the time to hear a different perspective on your company, which can be very valuable. Be open to any ideas that your team comes up with. Whatever you do in life, make sure you are passionate about it. It makes you enjoy your work so much more. ‍"," Through my position as a student manager for the USC football team, I was able to speak with multiple student athletes about what NIL meant to them and how we could develop the most convenient solution possible. Additionally, it helped that most of these guys were my good friends since I had spent time with them almost every day for 3-4 months. So being able to get honest, authentic feedback was super crucial to the success of our product. The value proposition is straightforward: We guide athletes throughout the process and help them make money from their NIL, all for free. So it didn’t take too much convincing for them. Approaching brands was a bit harder to do. Still, we ended up having over 40+ conversations with social media and influencer managers to investigate the influencer industry and how we can provide additional value in a fast-growing sector. Before completing the brands’ web app, we already have 5 brands that want to work with us and sponsor athletes on our marketplace once the web app is complete. ‍", Feel free to check out our Instagram or our landing page to learn more about what we’re up to!, We were a part of the Blackstone Launchpad fellowship in Spring 2021.

112,inovvorx," I am an entrepreneur/programmer from Bangalore, India in my early 30’s. Currently, I am working as a people manager and running a couple of content-based websites. InoVVorX was a web and mobile application development company that a friend and I started back in 2010. Our idea was to use the service based wing to generate enough revenue to build products. I took up the role of the CEO, while my friend handled the duties of a COO. We applied no thought about our job duties while picking our designation. Today, it is a no-brainer that I should have been the CTO. But in any case, that had little to do with our failure. After a rollercoaster ride, we shut the business down in 2016. ‍"," To be honest, though we managed to drive a fair amount of traction for the two products, we were never in the right direction. We had many fundamental flaws in the way we ran the business. With both products, we did not have a monetization model good enough to bootstrap the business. Also, we neglected our service-based business over time which meant that we were running out of money to manage our expenses. Whatever cash we had earned building websites and mobile applications was spent on bootstrapping the products. We reached a point where we had trouble paying salaries and had to lay off people. We were trying to keep the business floating by generating service-based revenue on one side and raising investment on the other. And, we did neither effectively. From there, it was only a downward spiral. We needed more people to generate revenue and we did not have enough cash in hand to pay them. ‍  Our failure was due to an amalgamation of reasons. I will elaborate on the major causes: Focus on too many things: Our focus was all over the place. We were running a service business along with 2 different products. Each of them was registered as a separate company on paper. Overall, we did a mediocre job at all three. Besides, shiny object syndrome was running strong within us. We wanted to grab every possible opportunity at success. I have only spoken about two major products in this article. A common mistake among entrepreneurs is to over-engineer products or develop something which isn’t a good product-market fit. Our blunders went much beyond that. We built several products simply because we had the technical strength to write code rapidly. We built a platform for people to showcase their talent in video, audio, pictorial, and content form. We built a portal for short filmmakers. I even spent a month developing a Quora replica because it seemed cool to do. There are other smaller products that I cannot even recall today. None of these helped drive any revenue or visibility, but they took months of programming effort. If there was a trophy for combining technical ability with stupidity and wasting time, I would win it hands down. We would build a product and not spend time nurturing it towards a path of growth. It was like planting seeds in different orchards and failing to nourish any of them before they even sprout. We never gave the right areas of business the attention it needed. Had we focused on one business alone, we’d have done much better. I am not saying we would have turned into a Unicorn, but we would have headed towards a better outcome than we did. Poor tracking of cash inflow/outflow: We had no idea where the money was coming from and going to. We were caught in the spiral of doing things and we did not care as long as we had enough money in the account to handle expenses. We believed we could make it big and handle the accounting nuances later. We must have spent a considerable amount of money on unnecessary expenses. The reason I say “must-have” is because I have no clue how much. When we sat down with the accountant for taxation each year, we’d pull our hair trying to figure out what each expense and revenue was for. All our transactions were clean and ethical, but we had little idea what went where. In hindsight, that was the primary reason why we ran out of money. Had we watched our cash flow, we’d have a longer runway to sustain the business. Lack of experience: I started with the thought process that I already had the necessary skills to build a successful business. I never spent an ounce of my time learning from other people’s mistakes or understanding how successful ventures operated. I assumed I was smart enough to learn the required skills on the fly. In reality, entrepreneurship involves so many diverse aspects that you need to put in the time to build expertise by talking to other businessmen, reading books, researching other startups, and looking for mentorship.  Assuming you already have the necessary skills to become a successful entrepreneur leads to the death of startups. Unfortunately, most entrepreneurs assume they already have what is required to run a successful business.  Entrepreneurship is like having sex in the shower. It sounds fancy as a concept but when you try it yourself you’ll realize that neither is it easy to do it right nor enjoyable throughout like you presumed. Failure to segregate responsibilities: Though we had different designations, as co-founders, we both tried to do everything. I have gone on sales meetings, done the taxes, handled hiring, participated in designing, and involved myself in digital marketing. My cofounder took part in all those responsibilities too. Programming was the only exception which I handled myself. That was solely because he wasn’t a techie. If he was, I’m sure we’d had written boatloads of code sitting on the same table. All in all, we both delved into all possible areas without any ownership or accountability making the whole process a major mess. Lack of a clear plan: We had no clear vision as to where we were headed. Our only plan was, “We want to make it big.” We could not specify what “big” meant to us. We were doing things adhoc. If someone asked us what did we intend to achieve that year, we would end up scratching our heads. We focused on what seemed right at the moment instead of setting a destination for the future. We were quick to pivot when things weren’t working, which was a good thing. But, again, we did not define goals for the pivot either. Our operations were like an empty boat in the river. We were flowing in the direction the current took us trying to find green pastures wherever we landed. After we ran out of money, I took up a full-time job and continued running the business out of my pockets while my partner moved on. After another year, I realized that the business was going nowhere. So after 6 years, I shut down the business. The closure was a mere procedure. It felt like a lost long war which only had to be declared ended. I had no regrets about the time spent on it. I felt no major emotions shutting it down because I knew that it was only a temporary pause for my entrepreneurship dreams.",,,,," Over the course of 5 years, we developed multiple products. For brevity, I will talk about two major ones. MedZee - An end to end practice management solution for dentists along with the option for users to book appointments. Doondoo - A business listing website with extensive details of businesses and gamification for end users. It was similar to Yelp, except that it wasn’t limited to restaurants or services alone. Our vision was to list every business no matter what the segment. The idea was to bring together comprehensive information about every brand in one place. Coming from a strong technical background, building a product was the easy part. It took around 2-3 months each to build the first versions of MedZee and Doondoo. Given the sophistication of the products, that was a major feat that I am proud of even today. They were built over different timelines and expanded over time. We managed to raise an early-round of small investment for MedZee. The other teams from the same investors were shell shocked at the pace we could develop products. So that was clearly our strength, and unfortunately, also the only one, which I will get to later. Our service-based business was running side by side. We worked with eCommerce clients like Decathlon in India, Property Finder from the middle-east real-estate segment, and other industries from different countries. Here is a soft copy of our brochure for the service-based business. We reached a total team strength of 27 employees at one point."," Technicality was our forte, so we resorted to digital marketing whenever possible. We had a real gap in terms of our in-person sales and marketing skills. Call it lack of confidence, the reluctance of introversion, or the influence of laziness, both of us as co-founders had a major allergy towards meeting customers. To cover that gap we hired sales executives who would meet dentists in the city and get them on board. Our idea was to sell the application as a SaaS product. The dentists were happy to use the appointment scheduling module because it drove revenue their way. But, the practice management side of the application was barely used because a bigger player with a much higher investment was dominating the market. Though our features were on-par, dentists were already using the other product. Migrating to ours would mean losing all their patient records. We managed to bring over 900 dentists on-board and scheduled over 4000 appointments in a span of a year. These 900 users were spread across 5 different cities. Barring the city we were in, we never visited any dentist from any other location. We hired two passionate interns who signed them up along with their pricing details and photos using phone calls. They were working remotely while they managed to pull this off, so they deserve a round of applause. For getting traction, we primarily used Facebook Ads and SEO. That was right in our expertise and we managed to iterate and experiment with different digital marketing options for conversions. Since the SaaS model was not working, we pivoted our monetization model and took a percentage cut for every successful appointment. For Doondoo, we hired two junior resources for looking up information on the internet, as well as calling brands for data population. We listed thousands of businesses and I cannot recall the exact figure right now. At its peak, we had about 200K monthly page views driven by SEO. We tried different monetization models by contacting brands, but we had little success. Google ads worked reasonably well(~2K USD/month), but that was nowhere enough to scale and grow. Here is our intro video about Doondoo. The quality seems laughable today, but given the tools available in 2012 and our limited skills/budget, we did a reasonable job: ‍"," I started writing code back in my teens because I was always fascinated by it. The idea of starting a software company started somewhere in those days itself even though the details were fuzzy back then. After my studies in Computer Science, I took up a job in a software company. I did not want to jump right into starting a venture before gaining exposure to the industry. While I worked at an organization for 2 years, I started developing web applications part-time for known people along with a classmate from engineering. That’s when we started crafting a plan to venture out on our own. Somewhere during that adventure, InoVVorX was born. A word of advice here. If you’re thinking of a name for your company, please pick something that is simple to pronounce and straightforward to spell. No one gives a rat’s ass about the name of your company except you. We opted for a fancy name. Every time I met a potential client, I would mention, “I am from Inno-Works, I-N-O-V-V-O-R-X.” Even after that effort, people would still get the spelling wrong. Anyway, we started InoVVorX as a service-based company, with a vision of building a web-based product. Back in 2010, raising investment at an early stage of a startup in India was an uphill task. Founders had to bootstrap and build the business to a certain extent before investors would consider putting in a small sum of money into your venture. Once you achieved reasonable sales and growth, the Series B funding had a lot of opportunities though. Today, that situation has changed drastically. Both of us co-founders come from a humble background and we did not have a lot of cash in hand to run the expenses until a growth stage. The initial capital we pooled in came from the little savings we gathered from our 2-year job stint. We knew that our only option was to find a way to generate revenue early. Since I had a strong background in programming and every business those days was looking for a website, we spotted an opportunity to fuel our business. We hired programmers at a reasonable cost and it worked. We used the money to hire other team members required for sales, designing, admin work, and programming. As we gained clients, I focused all my effort on building products with a couple of team members while the others handled the service-based business. Our plan was right on track. ‍"," The primary thing I would do is focus on one product. I would build a team where each person covered the weaknesses of other team members to form a strong cohesive foundation. I would refrain from involving in all possible aspects of the business, focus on my core areas, and encourage others to do the same. I would chalk a short term and long term plan for the business without letting one of them dilute the other. And of course, I would expect someone in the team to track where each penny of the bank account is coming from and going to. ‍",," You can find me on my blog, Productive Club. I write about productivity, time management, and decision making. I have written a book called The Magic of 2 Seconds, which provides different tactics for making better decisions in just 2 seconds. I recently started another website called Stop Shop Now, while my cofounder is running a Y Combinator funded startup called Volopay."," After my journey as a failed entrepreneur, I read a lot of books. My favorite is The E-Myth Revisited. I believe every entrepreneur must read this book before starting his/her first business. The Lean Startup is another good resource for tech startups. The Hard Thing About Hard Things goes through the challenges in terms of thoughts and decisions that a startup founder faces. A new entrepreneur must embrace ignorance and try to harness knowledge from any possible source. Today, you’ll find tons of insightful information from blogs, online courses, and books by clicking a few buttons sitting in front of a table. Assuming you already possess the skills or considering yourself too busy to learn is a recipe for failure. ‍"," Like I said before, we had no clear idea of how much we were making or burning. So, I cannot give you exact figures or monthly revenues. Overall, we must have burnt over $300k (USD) which was primarily earned from our service business, and another $100k in investment raised. Since we bootstrapped most of the business, we barely lost $5000 each from our personal savings. I do not want to put a tab on the money we lost as opportunity cost over the years because that experience has taught me lessons that I would otherwise never learn. ‍",Software & Hardware,Lack of Funds,India,"November 19, 2020",Maxim Dsouza,https://www.failory.com/interview/inovvorx,"['https://productiveclub.com/', 'https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Seconds-Better-Decisions-Mistakes-ebook/dp/B08DG8N7H8/', 'https://stopshopnow.com/', 'https://volopay.co/']",failure,0,,"InoVVorX was an app development company that both worked for clients and built their own projects.

113,iwantthatflight," Hi, my name is Garth Adams. I've built lots of sites over the years - sudoku.com.au, accountantlist.com.au, netlaw.com.au, kakuro.cc and more recently the travel site iwantthatflight.com.au. I'm 45 and based in Melbourne, Australia. I work a few days from home, and the rest in a great co-working space with the rest of the team (a massive 2 more people!). ‍",," Around 2013 I realized that SEO just wasn't working for me anymore. I was competing against companies that were worth millions, if not hundreds of millions, and they had entire departments focused on SEO. And they were winning. I was slowly losing my rankings and by spending all my time on SEO (which wasn't working anyway) IWantThatFlight.com.au was falling behind competitors in usability and features. I needed to let go of SEO and find a way to promote IWantThatFlight.com.au. It took a long time (Like everyone, I went through the entire ""Traction"" book) but eventually, I found a way to make Facebook work. I also worked with forums to find out exactly what visitors wanted and reacted to. This wasn't so much asking what they wanted, but just constantly posting updates/information and seeing which had the biggest response. Having 2 small children (3 and 5) during the most stressful time in 2013 probably did help, but they gave me a great release when I wasn’t working. ‍  Where to begin? Luckily, nothing that has proved too painful. The number one this was hiring without a practical test as part of the interview process and then having to let the employee go soon after hiring. ‍",,," Flights Metasearch has become saturated by a few big players. Collectively, they own the majority of the market. The challenge is not only to grow your share of the market, but also to convince suppliers to work with you. They are often small as well and have limited resources – it can be tough to convince them to spend any time with you if they are already working with a major.  ‍"," The initial script took just a few days – but then it was at least a year before I set it up on a public domain. I sent an email around to my friends asking them to try it out – but the UI proved “difficult”. I was requiring people to leave their email address, and I would email them the cheapest flights that were found. I struggled with this format for a while before dropping it in favor of live results. I had been using VB.Net in my previous jobs, so continued. ‍",," I have always been interested in computers – I’ve been programming in one form or another since primary school. I’ve always loved the creativity and the speed. You can start out with absolutely nothing and have something worth showing in just a few hours or days. This was true back when I started in the 80s and even more so now. ‍ What were your motivations to build IWantThatFlight? I first came up with the idea in 2001. Back then, there wasn't an easy way to compare flights (this was before kayak, skyscanner, etc) so I wrote a simple script to compare the 3 airlines that serviced the Australian domestic routes I was interested in. I was working full time for a rail infrastructure company (so interesting!) and just did this in my evenings. Then out of nowhere Sudoku came along and I had the good fortune to purchase sudoku.com.au. Sudoku was huge worldwide, and my site quickly rose to 50,000 visits a day. I quit my job, and went all in on Sudoku (not a something you hear every day). I coded up community features around the puzzles and at its height, it was hosting real-life parties all around the world. All good things come to an end, however, and after 2 years Sudoku cooled and traffic dropped off. I didn't want to go back to working for other companies and so hunted around for something else to do. After a few false starts, I dusted off IWantThatFlight.com.au and have been plugging away ever since. ‍ Have you had any failed business? The biggest dud I have had (out of several) is blogfight.com. This site allowed you put a widget on your blog (this was back in 2007 when blogs and widgets were huge) and it would match you up in a ""fight"" with another blog - that would be decided by traffic over a certain duration (e.g. a couple of days, a week etc., whatever you & the other blog owner decided). So, you and the other blog owner had a reason to trash talk each other, poke fun, rally your subscribers etc. and generally inject a bit of rivalry into the blog scene (and generate some extra traffic). I based the idea on a few contests I had seen between other blogs around that time. I spent weeks coding it all up. Making sure the widgets could handle the traffic. Making sure traffic fraud was accounted for. Everything. But not a moment spent on how it would make money, or even how to get the blog owners interested in taking part. I wasn't part of the blogging community so I didn't even have a peer group who would use it just because they knew me.  In the end, I canned it before even launching it properly, which was the right decision. Not knowing how the business was going to make money was just plain stupid, but the biggest lesson I learned was that I have to have a marketing channel which I know will work before starting on a project. The channel might be your email list, Twitter followers, Facebook or even the Buy-Sell-Trade section of a niche forum - just make sure you have something you know works."," “Creating/Fixing/Updating the site does not equal marketing”. As a programmer, you tend to think that if I add this feature/fix this bug etc then the very awesomeness of the site will take care of marketing. This is almost never true. You must have a plan to market the site/business as well as a plan for the site itself. ‍"," You name it, I've tried it. I had early success with SEO and so for a number of years I spent all my effort on that. SEO has the huge amounts of traffic for a B2C site, but of course you spend a lot of your time working to improve the site for search engines rather than users. I have also tried giveaways (nope), affiliates (ok, but doesn't move the needle), Twitter (too much all over the place), Adwords (too expensive) and traditional PR companies (no noticeable effect). ‍ How did you employ/approach these tactics? SEO is great for bringing in traffic, and also allows you to target the right ""sort"" of traffic. You can target search terms that are close to the purchasing section of the funnel. Facebook is great for the targeting ability and for the cost (vs Adwords which allows you to do similar targeting but is much more expensive). ‍ What didn't work? Why? Traditional PR. I spent several thousand on a PR firm. They got a few mentions in newspapers, but didn't have any boost in traffic (or anything) that we noticed. Google Adwords. This is a killing zone for travel searches. The bid prices have been pushed so high by companies like Expedia, Booking and Kayak that I have found it impossible to make money through Adwords. ‍ When did you start to see traction? How did that feel? The site puttered along for a few years as a side project. It wasn't until my main site (sudoku.com.au) started to decline that I decided to invest more time into iwantthatflight.com.au and actually see if it could become something (through SEO). Luckily, this was back in around 2006 so there were 2 things going for me: The Australian travel space wasn't very crowded. The existing big businesses were only just starting to notice the web and competition from overseas companies was non-existent.SEO was much, much easier back then. Once traffic started to pick up the main feeling was relief, actually. I had been running my own business for a number of years, but was only a few months away from being forced to go back to work. ‍ Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous? Being able to code. Online small business owners who cannot code are forced to either use offshore agencies to save money or spend more and use a local coder. Offshore coders save you money but require you to have much better documentation/specifications, quality is extremely variable and timelines are usually much longer. Going local improves those areas but is usually much more expensive. I know several owners that wait months for even relatively small updates.

114,jobridge," Hey! I am Jasmeet. A software engineer by qualification and an entrepreneur by passion. I started my first company, an IT service company located in India, around 10 years back (the company still survives and helps me pay my bills). Few years after my company started, I started working on a few ideas with friends. Some ideas clicked, some failed but the experience gained in trying new things was immense. Around 2 years ago, I discovered Quora and started writing answers related to entrepreneurship and startups there. I noticed, my readers there loved the experience and the stories I had to share. Quora also got me hooked to writing and I started my blog. I have been actively writing on Quora and my blog since then - sharing stories, experiences, and learnings from my entrepreneurial journey. Along with writing, I also started training working professionals and college students in digital marketing.  In the next few months, I am taking an exit from my current company. Yes! The same I.T company that helps me pay the bills. I want to take up writing full time and train people on entrepreneurship and digital marketing. But let’s get into the failure story of Jobridge, one of those businesses that I build that didn’t click and failed. Jobridge was one of the first job portals in India that helped job seekers start working in Indian industrial cities. The company mixed an online and offline business model to provide memberships to jobseekers and sell job postings to companies. All paid job seekers got vacancy notifications before anyone else and their resumes were sent first to the employers. I was a co-founder and my job consisted in creating the business plan, marketing strategy and close sales. The real USP of the portal was the ability to even cater to those who were not internet savvy. But soon we decided to grow the business by creating franchises in cities like ours. We approached small business owners in these cities and pitched them the following model: They could create a Jobridge franchisee, becoming the front face of the company in the city. They would have to get us paid job postings and jobseeker registrations. In exchange, they would get a commission on every sale closed by them. We were in charge of handling all the back-end operations. The investment from their end was very minimal. All we asked was some branding in their existing shop and someone who was trained enough to work on the web-based system built by us for franchisees. ‍"," As our premium job seeker base grew, we realized we were spending too much time handling our job seekers. For a very low price, they were expecting more features. Our office was just a few blocks away from them (as we were in a small city) so they would just walk in and ask us about the status of their job application. That was when we decided to increase our prices and many people start paying it. But now job seekers requested us more things and expected us to provide them the same services offered by recruitment agencies. The same happened with employers. They expected resumes to be delivered to their office showing statuses of each of their application. I think the direct face to face interaction we had with customers created an unrealistic expectation on us. Soon, the operation cost started beating the revenue because of all the support we now had to provide to employers and job seekers. This is when we realized our model was turning unsustainable. We had to either go offline and turn into a placement consultancy or go 100% online and turn into a job portal. But both of them already existed in the market. We had lots of doubts on what to do, until we reached a point in which salaries were regularly delayed and we were not getting paid. So, we decided it was time to shut down. We did this by giving refunds and shutting down the job portal. It’s always sad to close a venture. Our biggest regret was not grabbing an opportunity and taking it to the next level. We tried too many things in too short a time frame. I believe the biggest complexity we had at Jobridge was generated by our online - offline model. I learned the hard way that you can either be a job portal or a placement consultancy."," A big obstacle we found was selling to industries. These were so used to placement agencies coming to them and charging 8.3% for employees sent. We tried to explain them our process which was a unique model that involved the offline and online world. However, they kept confusing us with placement consultancies. They paid us the small job posting fees and then expected us to give services of placement consultancies. For this reason, is that we had to spend a lot of time educating clients and explaining them our process. Jobridge was a concept ahead of its time, which is always a challenge. For us, explaining and educating our customers took a lot of time. Sales only happened after a lengthy process of educating customers. We also had some disadvantages. We were in the business space and no one from the team had any experience with it. ‍",,,," The first version of the portal was launched as an extension of our existing business directory. It was only when the concept gained a little of popularity when we moved it to a separate domain name. Initially, we outsourced our web development work - it was a complete disaster. Our explanation to the agency we hired for the job was totally ignored by them. We ended up with a product which was nowhere near to our expectations. This problem delayed us one or two months.  So then, we decided to build it ourselves. The team included me handling business planning and sales, my co-founder who handled the design part and operations and 3 employees who handled programming, operations and sales. We used LAMP, HTML, CSS and Codeignitor Framework. The first step when creating Jobridge was building a basic job portal with working features for employers, employees and admins. This took us around 2-3 months. The launching site was really simple, with only the most basic functionalities. Once the portal was in place, we started improving the design and building new features such as a membership panel and an integration with SMS. So, it took another 3 months before our web-based system was ready. As we did this, we started training our operations and sales guys to handle job seekers, sell to industries and get some franchisees onboard to help us grow at a faster pace. Our pricing strategy was simple: Posting one job cost $10Jobseeker premium membership cost $15Franchise owners has to pay a one-time fee, which cost $200We kept a 50% commission from each sale made by the franchise (from both job postings and premium jobseeker memberships) I enjoyed every single moment of building Jobrdige. The business model was unique and the market was challenging. But I enjoyed every moment of experimenting new ideas and winning/losing with them. ‍",," The Job market is an evergreen market. Our city was declared as a SEZ Industrial area by the government which led to around 300+ industries setting their industrial units in the city. We saw this as a huge opportunity to get into the job market. We already had a business directory for the city so starting a job portal seemed rational. The gap we noticed in between job seekers and industries looking for candidates was the lack of awareness about the jobs posted by companies. The famous job portals in bigger cities were yet not popular in our city because of the lack of internet reach. Jobs posted in newspapers only got covered for a day. So, we were motivated by the objective of bridging this gap with a model in which jobs were posted by us on our job portal and the paying job seekers got notifications about the job posting via SMS on their mobile phones. Moreover, by that time, we were looking for more revenue streams for our online business directory. Our business directory was already famous with local business owners. However, we struggled to get any paid memberships from industries. Creating Jobridge seemed like a logical step to move ahead."," If you could talk to my former self before Jobridge, I would tell him that all that glitters is not gold. I would recommend him to spend more time on market research and less on sales. ‍"," In order to launch Jobridge, we used bulk SMS, newspaper and hoardings for brand awareness. Bulk SMS helped us reach job seekers in bulk but hoardings and newspaper had little or no effect on industries. These had to be approached personally. It took a lot of hit and trial using the above three methods to build an advertising and marketing promotion strategy. But they were our main attraction channels. To reach employers, we used cold calling and door to door marketing with the help of our sales guy. One strategy that worked pretty well to get job postings on our portal was looking at job postings advertised in newspapers and calling the employers to explain our business model. It took us some time to get them onboard and there were times in which we had to give them free vacancies to build a relationship with them. But with time, the flow of job postings got better. And one strategy that worked well to get premium job seekers membership, was bulk SMS and word of mouth. Our premium services and costs were reasonable so the word quickly spread. ‍", You can check out my blog LessonsAtStartup. Here is a blog article in which I write about startup failure. I frequently write on Quora and different news platforms such as Bplans and Shout Me Loud.," Entrepreneur is one of my favorite websites. It has all the right business advice for startup founders written by some of the most successful people around the world. My other favorite website is Medium’s entrepreneurship section. As for books, Lost and Founder by Rand Fishkin is one of my favorite ones. I have recently read it and I love it. The way Rand explains simple concepts of running a startup is quite insightful and interesting. It is a must read for all startup owners. Another book is The Other Side of Innovation, which I read a few years back. The book has some interesting concepts on how businesses should approach new innovative projects. The biggest takeaway from this book for me is that every innovative project should be approached as a new venture with separate teams, budget and plan. Most of the innovative ideas fail because founders share existing resources.  Finally, my favorite tools are Teamwork, Canva and Jira. They are all team management tools.

115,joker-greeting," Hey! My name is Travis Peterson. I make prank gifts but I am mostly known for musical greeting cards that have no off-switch and loop non-stop, on purpose, until the battery dies. The genesis of this company started when I was 8 years old and my dad called while he was traveling to tell me he won the lottery. Then he said, “April Fools!” Every year he had a new joke and I fell for it all the time. Joker Greeting started with making prank musical greeting cards but we now focus on all gifts and fun pranks. We prefer fun and funny gifts and not a**hole pranks. We want both sides laughing together. Joker Greeting is based in Irvine, California and we have some workers in Salt Lake City, Utah and my warehouse is based in Utah as well. The company manufactures in China and works with another team on product design. I am the only full-time employee, as well as the president and co-founder. I do it all: Building and maintaining the website on Shopify, talking with customers, business development with wholesale clients, creating videos for ads on Facebook and for the web, creating any new products, and managing the process towards launching of new products and categories. I could probably continue listing more jobs that I handle, with the exception of bookkeeping, packing, shipping and manufacturing. Most sells come mainly from my website, where I sell directly to my customers, but I also sell to other online stores and catalogs. It is a pretty basic business model. From there, I try to build out more product categories that are based 100% on Joker Greeting ideas. Right now, I have three product categories, but I should have two more really soon. Cross-selling should help me lock in new customers and grow organically. My goal is $1M in sales. This is very doable goal within two years. It’s not Facebook money but I am okay with that. ‍",," The largest obstacle was having every single unit become defective due to a bad batch of batteries. It was my largest purchase of cards and my vendors were placing sizable POs in the $20,000 range. I learned it was all defective about 4-5 months after selling thousands and thousands of units. It was painful and embarrassing. I hated getting up in the morning and reading my emails about complaints and my customers feeling cheated. Wisely, I had kept the money in the company, and slowly I had to refund every order and resend working units later on. When it was all done I didn’t any money left, or trust with my vendors, or much else. I didn’t even know if buying new cards would save me or bury me deeper. Obviously, I chose to keep going. My manufacturer did take the heat and offered to replace the units. But the damage was very severe. Shipping was costly, vendor orders shrunk significantly, and Amazon reviews were at one star. This Amazon effect crushed my direct sales as it was #2 on any search of Joker Greeting a glaring 1 star. The party was definitely over. This was late 2016. Above all, I tried very hard to be patient with every single customer. I begged for a second chance and sent them free cards when I got new ones. I cut prices with some vendors to try and keep the relationship and keep them happy. And I had to fix my Amazon rating I stopped selling that card and made sure no one else was selling that SKU on Amazon. I designed a new card and color and relaunched a new SKU on Amazon. On top of this, I had to get more reviews on Facebook and Google but I had to wait for all my defects and angry customers to stop complaining. Once I was able to fix my cards I was able to turn on a customer rating feedback and with 237 reviews were have 4.5 stars. Super happy about this! Other obstacles in comparison to this are small. Personal life and family (I have a wife and two kids now) is always a challenge but I don’t think it’s any more difficult than a normal job. It’s just different challenges.    The biggest mistake was pushing other non-traditional ideas too quickly. I knew that Birthday and Christmas cards were selling really well. I should have really focused on those two a lot more rather than pushing my Baby Card, and I’m Sorry, and other cards that sell less often. I ended up with too many units sitting on the shelf and not enough of the units I sell through. ‍",,, I stink at blogging and writing and creating daily content. I can’t Instagram or tweet very well at all. It’s just not interesting at all. I do it but I don’t think I am great at doing it. I do pay for help with writing blog posts. Blogs really do help and I wish I were better at it. I love being involved with my content but I know my limits. Joker Greeting is small brand and so many vendors just don’t think I can sell units. Or they worry their customers won’t get the joke or that it’s too rude and no one will buy them. Being small has other advantages but when trying to work with vendors it’s often not helpful.," This idea started in 2012 and didn’t launch until 2015. Not because it was really hard, but because we were both distracted and working on other projects. However, this non-stop singing card kept coming back and I had to act on it. Once I started to do the work, it took me about six months to finish it. I wouldn’t say it was hard work but there were no clear answers. I knew it could be done but, who would the right manufacturer be? And at what cost? And if I work with China, do I trust them? In this case, it was pure diligence or obstinacy that got me through. The initial prototype is what we launched with on Kickstarter. We didn’t want a super sexy card. We wanted a card that looked totally innocent and a little bit boring or dated. The biggest complication was that ordering 1,000 units was super expensive so total cost was $7/unit. When we launched on Kickstarter I charged $15/unit and that’s how I chose my price. No real challenges arose except for some timing issues. Originally, we planned to launch in February 2015 but it was apparent that was not going to happen. April 1 was coming up and I decided to just wait longer and launch on a great day. Although no one believed us on the day we launched it worked out better on April 2nd. Kickstarter launched on April 1, 2015. My brother shot the video in his house. We shot it in one hour and that was it. Luckily, he has a background in film directing and editing. I also went ahead and made some crappy iPhone videos but those turned out to be part of the success and shared more than our main video. In 30 days we were on ABC News, CNET, BuzzFeed, radio shows, and more and raised $92,073. While I had no plans to build a company it was apparent that I had. Halfway through the campaign I started the Shopify store, bought a domain, and did all the legal paperwork. Joker Greeting was officially born. I flew in ½ of the Kickstarter orders and put in my garage. The next ½ was being shipped ocean and arrived just in time when this was mostly gone. I packed and shipped nearly every single one of these orders with some part-time help. ‍",," I have a B.S. in finance and have worked in two small investment banks in New York City for about six years. I used to love that job but I decided that I wanted to make stuff instead of watching other people make stuff. This was the beginning of me launching my “entrepreneurial” path. I had an idea for gathering personal stories through online collaboration. While building my first company I also decided to get a MBA and meet some folks who might want to join my venture. During school, I was able to build a beta website and beta mobile app, but that was the easy part. I used a lot of my savings and some family helped me too. I went to trade shows and talked with investors. However, after 2.5 years of hard work I could never get off the ground or find the right partner to join me. Ultimately, I had to stop trying. Looking back on my first venture, the problem was very clear, but I wasn’t able to solve it. I think the rule of thumb is making a product 10x better than current solution and my product was like 2x-3x better. I had some traction but not enough growth. And that’s why Joker Greeting took me by surprise and showed me what a startup really looks like a solid idea grows organically and virally. Joker Greeting started as a funny project between my brother and me. We saw a musical doll at my mom’s house and we thought that it would be funny if we made the doll sang a non-stop song. We pitched our dad because he is funny and he told us to make a greeting card instead. He was absolutely right. There was no business plan. There was no market research. This wasn’t even supposed to be a business, it was simply a way to make $2,000, have fun and buy a PS4. Then I would move on. Instead, we raised $92,073."," I am not a regretful person when it comes to business. Things happen and I choose to move onward. Challenges and obstacles, I didn’t see before were necessary to learn so I don’t think I would change anything. I enjoy my job and for whatever reason, I get up every day and work in my office all day and I don’t take as many breaks as I should. It’s fun and I enjoy it. Many startups are fearful about talking about their idea as if it will magically work in someone else’s hands better than yours. And quite frankly, if that is true, then you probably shouldn’t be doing it. Be more open to ideas and don’t worry about competition as much as you do. Tell more people than you normally would and doors will open.  "," Because the launch was so successful I had a few vendors contacting me to buy my cards at wholesale. And Kickstarter was a link to my new Shopify store so it was pretty seamless keeping the party going. In all, the Kickstarter was much more successful than $92,000 if the next 30-60 days were included. And we never spent more than $400 on marketing and ads (I probably should have). But no party lasts forever. I’d say the next 12 months were still pretty easy. But sales started to slow down I had to find ways to keep selling cards and do my own marketing. I tried Reddit ads, Google SEO, Google ads, StumbleUpon, Instagram, and a few small ad agencies. Facebook ads offered the best ROI. And quick videos 15-30 seconds had the most impact. I tried static images but I never saw many conversions. Part of my growth strategy was to continue to launch new categories on Kickstarter and rely on my Kickstarter community. This has worked pretty well. I launched a device called the Cricket and raised $15,000. I struggled to sell it after Kickstarter. I was sitting on inventory and nothing was moving, maybe 1-3 units a day. I decided to make new videos and show how I used the cricket these videos transformed my sales into selling 30-50 units a day without changing my ad spend from before. My lesson show the customer how to use the product in their life, don’t tell them features. Example 1: How Card Works in Water Example 2: First Cricket Video That Spiked Sales ‍"," I encourage anyone to learn more at our website, and say hi or buy a card. I really do like helping anyone who might have questions. So just ask them below!"," Books are very inspiring. Creativity Inc, by Ed Catmull explains the great way in which Pixar was built. I think this book taught me not to control the process but have the process (and people) speak up. Listen to them. And hire people better than you. I just finished Principles by Ray Dalio. A very deep dive into employee management. An absolute stunner beginning to end. It’s almost more of a textbook than others. The Hard Thing about Hard Things by Ben Horowitz is a must read to scare anyone straight who thinks startup life will be fun. Lots of people tell me I am living the dream. I guess, if living the dream owning up to all the problems and taking all the risk. Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is amazing. This helped me deal with customers better and think about my copy on the website and emails. I can’t recommend this book enough but you definitely need to be willing to get science.

116,juice-startup," I’m Wit and I’m based in Bangkok. I have a family business in the hospitality and travel industry. I'm on the corporate B2B side, which hasn't been doing much since the pandemic started. I turned myself into the digital business world, where I’m learning to get started with projects and see what happens. My first idea was to have a digital marketing service for products, course creators, or any other companies that wanted to advertise. I connected them with newsletters because I believe that newsletters are under-monetized. There are many good newsletter creators out there who are working hard to build an audience, but they don't have a good monetization strategy. The great thing about newsletters is that they are very targeted. It's very powerful because is highly targeted compared to online ads on Facebook or Google. It's a win-win for advertisers to connect with audiences that are relevant to them. I'm running a solo no-code agency now. I'm a freelance for growth tools, database/spreadsheet, and automation. ‍"," Once I got to the point of calculating how many bottles I had to sell until this became a profitable project. That’s when I decided to pull the plug on the experiment before it got more carried away.  Watching interviews of long-standing juice businesses in the space revealed that people with $50,000+ worth of juice machines serving several hundreds of bottles daily are very passionate about juice. They began with sizeable volume from day 1 because they have been hobbyist juicers who have been documenting their juicing for years before doing it commercially. The juice community sees them as influencers. They had relationships with customers from day 0. “If I pursue it further I would have a new hobby, but I don't see it as a business.”"," To break-even, I needed to sell more than 500 bottles priced at Starbucks espresso. One person can only drink one 80 ml bottle per day. So, I needed to sell to 50 highly committed customers just to not make a loss. ‍",,,," It was almost all on the supply side. Thanks to the magic of e-commerce, I could do next-day home delivery of a commercial-grade vertical cold press juicer and an excellent horizontal cold press juicer. I spent $2000 on shiny machines to extract natural goodness. I spent the next 3 weeks googling juice combinations and recipes. Navigating the messy and inconvenient organic produce ecosystem of Bangkok. Most merchants of “organic produce” don’t know where their stuff comes from. I had sampled liters of fresh juice, which produced great results for my body. It was done. I came up with the secret commercial recipe that made bitter melon juice barely drinkable. That wasn’t enough, I came up with more recipes of health-boosting cold press juice. Ginger, turmeric, garlic, and white mugwort to name a few. Turns out those are also not needed because the market is not that big. The only way to get my juice to people was to use a delivery app. It turns out the cost of delivering juice is the same as the cost of the juice. I tried to package them like a shot. They're very small because they're strong. The pricing doesn't work out because I cannot charge for them as a premium beverage. It's a physical business, and the profit margin is not very high because you need a workforce and you need to work with fresh ingredients."," I sent samples to selected healthy juice enthusiasts, diabetic-risk people, health-conscious people. The results ranged from “This is OK” to “I’d rather not touch it ever again even for free”. ‍"," After a long day of trying to get a ghost restaurant off the ground, my brain made the connection to something that might have untapped market potentials: Asian bitter melons. I tried a plain bitter melon drink and choked. It’s named “bitter melons” because they’re so darn bitter. It’s one of those foods that scientifically proven to lower blood sugar and a host of other health benefits. A quick maths in my head revealed that tens of thousands of diabetics and those at-risk would need daily doses of magic lower blood sugar juice. If only someone would be able to make a bitter melon juice that went from choke to death to barely drinkable, it will sell like crazy. I went all-in without validating the idea. ‍"," I would try to make an MVP first. Set up a Facebook or Instagram page and see if they're interested in healthy juices with a strong taste. Reach out to diabetic communities to see if they have an interest in juices like the one I made. I would have known people would prefer taking their current medication rather than a juice too difficult to drink. Instead of 3 weeks of mixing juice, I should have spent 3 weeks of market research on juice enthusiasts in Bangkok and validating my assumptions directly with diabetic potential customers. ‍  My main takeaway is to have customers from day 0. Call it pre-launch audience building, content marketing, whatever. It’s about having relationships as early as possible and nurture them. “Solutions do not equal demand. Just because a healthy option is available doesn’t mean that people will choose it.” Make a landing page and see if there's a problem that I'm looking to solve. Many of my ideas will not make any revenue but my cost of starting is zero. I can try out ideas fast. If my ideas fail, it’s fine because I’m not attached to them. We're not the ones to decide if ideas are good or not, it’s the market. Validate your idea. Put it out there and see what happens. If it doesn't work out is fine too, because a lot of successful people failed the first time. ‍",, Here’s a post where I wrote about the story.You can find me on Twitter., NoCodeMVP made by Bram Kanstein.

117,justreachout," Hey Failory! Thanks for having me here! Like you, I’ve always been interested in the juicy details of failure. Learning from others’ mistakes can give you a lot of perspective around considerations you might be blind to when you’re concentrating all of your energy on turning an idea you have into a profitable business. I’ve been doing marketing and PR in the startup space for just over a decade now and many of the projects I’ve set out to work on often produce outcomes quite different from what I initially expected.  Currently, I’m working with a very lean team to scale the impossible - a SaaS PR business. That’s right, we’re working to massively impact the way entrepreneurs and marketers at early-stage startups tackle their PR strategy! We’re based in Brooklyn, NY but have seen over 5,000 users on our platform from all over the world. We provide you with: the framework and resources you need to develop your PR campaign, a platform to find the most relevant journalists and track your outreach efforts, a sense of whether or not what you want to pitch is newsworthy, feedback to perfect your pitch, and all the necessary details in between! ‍",," Every roadblock to growth has forced me to look more closely at what we really need in the tool and what we must continue to improve over time. In the early days, we launched a version of the product that was self-serve and many customers didn’t understand our approach, so they ended up misusing the tool. We’ve since gone back and provided guidance and education to help people get their campaign underway in a far more efficient manner. We are a super lean team and we are growing while also still striving to educate customers who are accustomed to more traditional PR outreach or not experienced in outreach at all. We work hard to support our customers’ campaigns and provide them with the tools necessary for several different outreach tactics.   Financially, being bootstrapped has given me the freedom to take things at my own pace. For many other founders, this path isn’t the best way to go. Despite the limitations, I have no regrets about the decisions I’ve made to grow JustReachOut. ‍",," We plan to continue to be the trusted source for marketers and entrepreneurs from rapidly growing early-stage companies who want to put their team on a path of early PR successes through relationship building and personalized outreach. If we’re able to grow 25% in the next quarter and then 50% in the next year, I’ll feel satisfied with my goal to teach people about some of the lesser-known but highly effective approaches to PR.",," JustReachOut was built on Ruby on Rails, through each iteration of the software we continue to add features that add value based on user feedback and how we can make the process of PR research easier.  I wrote about JustReachOut's early days in this blog post and started selling the app before it was even built! I leaned on my own technical skills until I absolutely needed an engineer who could create a more functional version. At that point, I brought on a friend, who generously took on the task of creating what I see as the first true version. JustReachOut was still just a side hustle at the time. When the roadmap for developing the product further became too unwieldy for a side project, he stepped away. Then I brought on a silent partner who provided an immensely talented bunch of engineers and product managers. We improved the search engine's functionality and outreach capabilities. Finally, we were able to focus more on teaching customers how to do their own PR and that’s when Corey McAveeney (my wife) officially joined the company, in 2018, lending her experience in sales, copywriting, and customer retention.  ‍",," When I was in the seventh grade I had a job after school working for a family friend who had his own business. It wasn’t anything fancy, but I got to see from an early age the freedom that an individual had to turn an idea into something profitable, and it was all his or hers. This was unheard of when I was growing up in the Soviet Union, so the concept of capitalism and entrepreneurship got into my brain and left me interested. When I was in high school I started working after school at a CAD software company where my uncle was an engineer. I did QA testing and this experience led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science in college. Out of school, I was hired as a software engineer, coding flight plan simulations for training military jet pilots. The work was cool but I grew out of the day to day monotony and the old-school corporate tech culture in a few short years. Plus, completing twenty pages of government paperwork for every page of coding killed my momentum. I started paying attention to the buzz coming from Silicon Valley, the rising stars of tech startups, and the all-in data-driven marketing efforts. I wanted to be a part of it all, to experiment with moving the needle and watch a small startup grow from the inside. I ended up in business school in California, not quite in the Bay Area, but close enough, in Monterey. With the goal of meeting the right marketer or founder who would be willing to take me under his wing, I knew that making new connections at school and through the strong alumni network would increase my chances of landing a gig where I could roll up my sleeves and learn at break-neck speed. I did just that, I was introduced to Mrinal Desai through the Dean within the first few weeks of school. Mrinal was an early LinkedIn employee, he had recently left the company and was currently doing the marketing for a remote helpdesk tool called Crossloop. He proved to be a phenomenal marketer and eager to introduce me to what he was working on for the purpose of getting some of the more tedious tasks off his plate.  From there I worked for a design firm, ZURB, where I really got a chance to apply everything I learned from Mrinal and run a lot of fun marketing campaigns - including an amazing speakers series - where I could zero in on the stories of founders, investors, and designers. I was having a blast living in California but my wife and I also started planning ahead and wanted to move back east to have a family. Before we did that though, we took a good amount of time off, traveled the world, figured out what we wanted to work on next and then moved to Boston. I started Criminally Prolific, a marketing consultancy that focuses largely on SEO, PR, and content related advising. Two years later, JustReachOut launched to support the work I was doing for clients, with an aim to make it useful for any marketers to dive into a PR campaign without too much effort or breaking the bank. I created JustReachOut and enlisted a few friends along the way for technical support, got my wife to join once I was at a phase where we had prospects and customers who were looking for something more robust than my PR hacks and she began to do the work of tying it altogether more cohesively and creating a framework for all the tactical stuff.  I’ve dabbled in building a few apps and of course got my start in tech as an engineer, but JustReachOut has been my very first product. When I started prototyping things, I really focused on what other marketers would find useful. I was involved in the founder community in Boston and I was constantly unofficially surveying the pain points marketers had with the PR process. So I convinced people to subscribe to the software before it was available. I would get feedback from my initial customers, incorporate it into my mockups, talk with more people and built it from there.  I built a basic version of the platform. But before I built it, I got buy-in from other marketers at meetups in Boston, where I was living at the time. I even got people to pay for the tool ahead of the launch. I would sketch ideas of how I was thinking it would look on a piece of paper and ask other people in marketing for feedback until I started getting responses that amounted to yeah, I'd pay for that. Getting constant feedback from someone, incorporating it into my sketches and showing it to them, again and again, is how I won my first customers. ",," From the very start, I tested the concept with a small group of marketers, then expanded it as my consulting work grew. I would sketch out different functionalities and features I wanted to build until I got feedback from people that they would pay for such a product. Then I had people pay me for the software before I built it. That really motivated me to stay on track and deliver a minimum viable product that was still valuable. The distance between then and now seems light years away but remaining focused on my mission to teach other marketers how to do their own PR really kept things attainable. I wasn’t distracted by the more traditional features that I could have built to keep a small number of customers happy - there are plenty of tools out there to send bulk pitches or manage list building and segmentation. These details wouldn’t get the little guys on the map. So I worked on creating PR search tools that could be easily adopted by someone looking to increase brand awareness and run a more agile PR campaign. If you’re in marketing and you never had a chance to sink your teeth into a holistic strategy that incorporates PR with your typically siloed content and SEO strategies, PR will continue to be the element that can boost your overall marketing efforts. So many people assume PR is a skill set they don’t want to acquire or think they don’t have time for. My first approach in the marketing I’ve done has been to educate people, to show them they’re capable of learning how to do their own PR.  We’ve just launched a new offering that is a pure product. After baking our strategy and tactics into the platform in the form of a PR Program and releasing some new features for getting press, we’re seeing a clear picture of the most successful customers. These are people working in industries very similar to past successful customers only now we can identify them as future successful customers early on and provide them with the right guidance before they even become a customer. We know that customers who have a content marketer on their team will have a shorter distance from onboarding to seeing results. We also know that customers who have proprietary data that translates into a story of impact or provides insights into an existing buzzworthy news topic will be able to more easily find journalists interested in hearing more.   "," If there is one thing you can do to for your startup, it’s communicating. This might mean you need to better communicate with your spouse that you won’t be home in time for dinner, or your team that you think the product roadmap needs more work, or maybe you need to connect with your audience in a new and different way. All of these efforts will help you improve your business and your peace of mind. Only one of them will directly increase your brand’s visibility.  I urge you to think about the type of impact your brand or story can have on your community of customers, prospects, and fans. Imagine the outcome you want to see with a PR campaign and we can help you define what efforts will help make it all possible.

You have to see it in action to fully understand what it does, but basically if you have a video filmed in landscape mode of someone dancing, our AI tracks the dancer and can crop the video so it works really well in vertical mode like you see on TikTok and Snapchat, IG stories, etc. I’m the CEO and one of the two founders, along with an amazing engineer, Radu Amarie, from Bucharest, Romania. My job is to make sure that I have the most talented engineers and product people I can find, make sure they are happy, and that the product we created fits the needs of our target customers. Of course there are things like fundraising, investor relations, financial planning, intellectual property and all that other stuff, but they are either impossible or unnecessary if you don’t have a product that people need and love. Our business model is Software-as-a-Service so people pay us monthly or annual subscriptions to use Kamua online. ‍",," The number one challenge we have faced is trying to separate the signal from the noise. You get a TON of noise and it is very, very distracting. You get paying customers who ask for new things they don’t need and don’t use. You get investors telling you that you need to do X instead of Y and they don’t really know the business or sector but are applying general things they have read or experienced. You get competitors releasing new features that scare the crap out of you but then you go have a closer look and you realize that they are completely over-hyping their capabilities. Anything you can imagine, it happens. Money is the second biggest challenge. There is such a thing as being overfunded, but we have no idea what it actually feels like because we have always been lean and efficient. But, for sure if we had $1 million in the bank we would be doing more and better things right now, so we have to overcome the growth obstacle because there are only three main ways to get meaningful cash: Demonstrate a tech benchmark that is much, much higher than the best in the sector and raise money from VCs who value tech.Sell your product/service to paying customers for a profit.Get tons and tons of loyal free users and demonstrate the data advantage that gives you compared to everyone else. Any of these can also mean you get acquired by someone who sees either your tech or your product or your revenue or your customers as valuable. But that’s an endgame not an obstacle. Nobody has failed by realizing, “damn nobody wants to acquire us.” They failed before that happened. There is also the personal challenge that I’ve been through. For the past five years I’ve been pretty much unable to invest in improving the quality of my life. I went from having a pretty nice monthly income to less than 10% of that income, and that affects where/when you can go on holiday, what kinds of nice things you can buy, whether you can help people in need, and even what healthcare plan you can afford for yourself and your partner. It’s pretty brutal but it’s necessary so you don’t have this false sense of security. The first $225k into the company came from my own pocket, and I know there are gurus who say don’t do that, but I think it’s helped sharpen my focus further to not have the distractions that go with more personal financial resources. Sounds totally counterintuitive, but it also means you have to sell your vision to investors, you have to find other ways of incentivizing your people, and you have to find perseverance you didn’t know you had. Cliché but nonetheless true.  Our greatest disadvantage is our ambition. We know we are taking on the world’s giants like Adobe, Apple, Vimeo (part of the massive IAC group) and many other well-funded companies and startups. We envisage an ideal world where people from anywhere and any financial capability can express their creativity. Why is that a disadvantage? Because we are constantly biting off more than we can chew and trying to do more and more, introduce newer and more amazing technology, and getting further and further ahead of the tech curve. That tends to put more of a focus on building and less of a focus on growth, and because we rely on web browser technology to deliver our service, we are always pushing the boundaries of what those browsers were designed and built to do with video. It’s one thing if you just want to play back video in a browser it’s another thing entirely to get a millisecond-specific cut in a video based on the exact timing of a sound. So to counteract that, you have to continuously try to bring innovation to your customers but resist the temptation to build “just one more feature.” We’ve built a massive service with so many moving parts and we did that while trying to just make it easier and faster for people to convert their videos from one size to another. Never underestimate complexity, but also don’t let your ambition drive you to increase that complexity beyond its minimum required level. ",," We want to be the go-to brand for creative people who don’t want to be constrained by software and hardware.  We definitely want to generate revenue and become profitable so we can invest back into our tech and our customer experience, but we will also balance our growth with a free tier when we are ready to support non-paying customers. If we need venture funding, we will go looking for it in the right place at the right time. Every day we are on the lookout for talented and motivated people to join our team. There are only six of us total full time in the company, so we have built a pretty monstrous amount of tech and product with such a tiny team. But we’re a bit like special forces in that we operate better with fewer people so we’re not tripping over each other and getting bureaucratic. That doesn’t mean we don’t respect and follow process - the contrary. You should see our Github! Our next feature is the ability to edit video by editing the transcript. We already have automated captions/subtitles, but what if you want to edit the transcript and have that automatically remove the parts of the video that you deleted from the transcript? This is going to be a game-changer for people who want to edit video but are scared by complex or goofy looking interfaces. ‍",," Me, personally, I didn’t build the actual product. I elevated my CTO from Findie (Radu, one of the top 5 smartest people I have ever met) to co-founder and he built it with our core team of engineers. Sure, I was involved in most of the decisions, but my job was to set the vision and go raise the money we needed to get our MVP to market.  We started out by looking at the fully-automated tech that we had built to solve the problem of having to edit tens of thousands of video trailers. We asked ourselves a fundamental question: what happens if the customer wants to fully automate the conversion from horizontal landscape to vertical portrait and the result is anywhere from 50% accuracy to 99% accuracy? What tool do you give that customer to either fix the 50% they didn’t like (or was totally wrong) or just that 1% tweak? So, imagine you’re the customer. You are being offered a self-driving boat ride to the island you need to get to, but the self-driving boat won’t drop you off at the pier. Maybe 5 meters away, maybe 10m or 50m or 1km. In any case you’ll have to swim a bit. Now, if you love swimming, and that’s how you were originally going to get to the island, no problem, you like manual stuff. If you don’t know how to swim, and you thought the automated boat was going to get you all the way there, major problem. That’s why we invested so much time and effort into building an easy to use interface that works really fast and intuitively. It takes 20 minutes to learn how to use Kamua. You can spend 50 to 200 hours in desktop software learning the skills required to do what our AI automation does for you. And even if you do learn those skills, our AI is way faster than the fastest most skilled human, and most people who work in editing will tell you that it wasn’t their life’s dream to crop videos for a living. So we are careful not to destroy the love and the art of video editing. Drum machines and MIDI sequencers didn’t destroy the art of drumming, they just made it possible for millions of people to create hip hop and dance tracks without a full on drum kit. Some of the best songs in history were created with minimal musicianship. This is what technology can do: unlock creativity by removing barriers to execution. ‍ So back to the nuts and bolts of the product building. We built everything to be used in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox & Safari) and to work in the cloud. We didn’t want to force customers to have to download and compute stuff locally. Our first customer had the exact problem we wanted to solve: they had really old and slow laptops for their social media managers, but these were the people under pressure to get videos out in a timely manner. That customer is part of the Omicom group, so they are a great first customer for us. We then got in touch with Google and let them know what we were building. And even though they were working on something called AutoFlip which they eventually released open source, that crops videos, and we have a competing technology, they invited us into their Google Cloud for Startups program and provided us with $100,000 in cloud credits so we could deploy our service anywhere in the world and have fast processing for our customers. After that, we did the same with Nvidia in their Inception program and with HubSpot in their startups program, so we are building partnerships with these amazing companies and getting a tailwind when we need it the most. So now, our service is fully deployed on Google Cloud and anyone in the world can sign up and request access to it.",," The idea for Kamua came from a need to provide people with the ability to auto convert their widescreen YouTube style videos to vertical mobile formats for apps.  First, we built a Netflix-for-short-film at Findie. Then, using AI we built, we automated the creation of short 10-15s trailers and we made hundreds of thousands of those for clients like L’Oréal, Nissan and Red Bull.  ‍ When it became obvious that these videos would also need to be converted into vertical versions, we built additional AI that identifies the focal point in each segment of a video and automatically crops the video to fit the desired size, like vertical or square. Then, we created Kamua as a brand that would help us distinguish from Findie. In the Hawaiian language, Kamua means “the first.” In Swahili it means to squeeze, compress or crush, which is kind of cool because we have tech that does all that. We just stumbled on the name and it worked out quite well. Our mascot is a chameleon (we call it “The Kamuleon” lol) which we really loved because it’s an animal that adapts to survive and we help people adapt their videos so they look like they were always intended for whatever screen they are on.  I came up with Findie, our original project, while I was doing my MBA. At the time it was obvious to me that there was no way of discovering the best curated short films out there. People were watching more and more videos online and on mobile and it just seemed logical to me that there was going to be a demand for great stories told by people outside of Hollywood who just didn’t have access to that kind of distribution. We got several thousand users but we quickly pivoted to a revenue generating B2B model. So that particular project is kind of a success but also in a way it failed to meet its original goals. The simple reason is that you have to focus on one thing at a time, and as soon as we launched Findie, we got a bunch of requests from really great brands who wanted to have their own branded version of the site with their own content. So we quickly got pulled into building a white label version and we made a fair amount of money with that, and it led us to build Kamua because of the need to automate video thumbnails. Maybe one day Findie will blow up if some celebrity loves it or we spin it out. I know you like to highlight failure and the role that it plays on shaping future decision making! What we did was fail in lots of small ways. We failed to understand how to build a user experience that instantly hooked people. Some people were like, well this isn’t the best video I’ve ever seen so I’m not coming back. Others wanted to watch series and not just one-off short films, so we failed at matching up brands with content with UX with user acquisition with monetization with retention. Way, way too many things to get right. You don’t start learning to juggle by juggling five samurai swords standing on a log in the middle of an alligator swamp. It would be a lot better to start with two tennis balls in the middle of your garden. What we learned from this is: singular focus. We focus 100% on Kamua and making it the best and fastest video repurposing tool on the planet. “Will it make our customers happier and keep them coming back?” is the question we ask when we are faced with a decision. I learned this from Steve Redgrave and his gold-medal winning Olympic rowing team. “Will it make the boat go faster?” That’s how they did it. ‍"," We should have released the fully automated trailer/preview/video thumbnail generator two years ago when we had the first working version. Sure, that would have resulted in a lot of frustration for customers who would not have been able to change anything in the result, but some people would have been happy with the fully automated results, and we missed an opportunity to make those people’s lives easier. We decided instead to build the editing system because we looked at cloud computing costs and it would have cost a lot of money to produce a lot of discarded results, and we anticipated the frustration of people not being able to tweak something that was automated and almost perfect - but wasn’t. So me personally, I didn’t want us to be thought of as a brand and company that promised customers they would be able to tweak things “soon” knowing that browser based manual editing is a very complex thing to build. “Fake it ‘til you make it” only works if you are providing something with a lot of promise or you have really gullible investors. A lot of the faking leads to dead companies but we get biased when we see the unicorns who used to fake it.  All that said, we would have had paying, or at least non-paying but happy, customers and kept the frustrated people in a mailing list that would be much bigger than the one we have right now. So that’s definitely something we would have done differently if we could go back in time 24 months: communicate really clearly what the tech can do and people who were willing to sift through a bunch of unwanted results would still have found value when our tech got the results right. "," We’re just starting to grow this particular “prosumer” business so our marketing strategy is very much a WIP. To begin with, we are prioritizing paying customers, so people have the opportunity to become Supporters and pay to use Kamua right now. That’s a bit of exclusivity - kind of like Superhuman does - and it’s really because we want customers who are willing to invest the time and effort to learn how to use Kamua properly. Steve Jobs famously said, paraphrasing here, that the computer is a bicycle for the mind. We think Kamua is a Lime Scooter for creativity. When things get steep, you just keep pressing the lever and up you go. We had a period of open Alpha access last year but what happened was we got a lot of people in who were purely curious. They didn’t need to edit video or work faster, they didn’t invest the time to learn how it works, so they ended up just distracting us from our mission. We don’t offer free stock footage or free audio files or free templates. If you don’t have existing video to repurpose, you’re not going to really get the most out of Kamua. So right now we’re marketing only to people who need to repurpose video for a living and we want to save them time. One of our customers went from managing a 16 hour end to end process to doing it himself in Kamua in 15 minutes. It sounds like a made-up story but it’s real. Between exchanging Excel files and screenshots and all of the stuff that 2 teams in 2 different companies used to do, the customer now grabs the videos he needs from his client’s YouTube channel, mashes together and crops the video to the social media format he needs, and sends it to them for concept approval. Fifteen minutes end to end.  And he gets them three videos instead of just one. So if we really wanted to boast we’d say “48 hours to 15 minutes” but the reason we don’t say that is because the extra two videos the customer produces are the added value to his client, and the time savings are the added value for him and his colleagues. That’s a force multiplier. They can A/B test now, whereas before with the time and budget constraints they could not. Another great use case from a different person at that same customer that she just made us aware of this morning. Because of Covid-19, she is working from her parents’ place in the mountains where there is only a 3G connection. She works exclusively in Kamua and only uses files that are already available in the cloud, no uploading or downloading. Without Kamua, she would not be able to work because nobody else can take care of her parents and in the time of Covid, this is increasingly a common scenario that people are working remote on less than ideal connection speeds. So that made us believe there are hundreds of thousands of people like that customer all over the world and we are in the process of finding them. Revenue is just starting out. That particular B2B customer is on an annual pre-paid contract at $700/year per user. We have higher tiers and also entry-level tiers for Supporters, as low as $21/month right now with an annual subscription. Some of our growth strategies include making tutorials that we post on YouTube and Reddit, that help people with competitor software, like Adobe. We think it’s restrictive to just post tutorials on how to use your own product when your target audience is facing problems using other legacy software, and your current software doesn’t solve all of their problems. They see the Kamua brand, they associate us with solving problems for creative people and some of them will be curious enough to see what we offer. It’s a slow-burn piece of the strategy, but it does work. We are getting hundreds of new subscribers to our various social channels every month this way, and we just started. ‍"," We have a blog at Kamua on which we post not only tech stuff but also video tips and soon we’ll be posting business and entrepreneurship articles as well. We are just getting our direct-to-customer launch up and running so our social media machine hasn’t quite kicked into gear yet, but it will soon. Your readers are welcome to reach out and connect to me on LinkedIn and they should mention this article in their intro message."," A piece of advice I would give to anyone just starting out: never underestimate the power of consistent persistence. Success compounds. Drill that into your brain. You have to master the balance between questioning what you are building and having doubts about what you are building. Remember that if you have a solution to a pain point, it might be an aspirin (nice but not essential) or it could be morphine (need it right now). I know a startup in the medical video call space that in February this year was two weeks away from shutting down due to low demand and a month later were taking VC money at 10x their previous valuation. Don’t underestimate the role that luck and timing play in your success, but also be prepared to pivot when you know that you are not even close to achieving product-market-sales-fit. Musical.ly - which became TikTok - was building a distance learning video app and pivoted with their last $10k. Slow growth is OK. Pivoting to an epiphany concept is also OK. Persistence is only truly valuable when you are persisting thoughtfully. For learning, I want to give a shout-out to Bram Kanstein, a super supportive guy who embodies a lot of the principles of true entrepreneurship. He created Startup Stash which might still be the most-upvoted product ever on Product Hunt. He also has a course called NoCodeMVP and I think that’s something any entrepreneur starting out should subscribe to and benefit from. It’s on AppSumo right now for $100 off. There are so many distractions for entrepreneurs that your reading list could end up being 1,000 items in just a month. I’m just going to pick my top 10 across all resources.

119,kaya-gs," I’m Gabriel Benmergui, 34, and currently, a Senior Product Engineer at CircleMedical, a YC backed startup in the Medical space. Recently, I’ve designed, managed and implemented an end-to-end EMR - the software used by doctors to document and treat patients. Before becoming a Software Engineer, I was an aspiring professional Go Player and became the #1 player of my generation in all South America. The Game of Go was my passion in my teens and 20’s. I wanted to make a living with the game and making it professionally was extremely competitive: thousands of players would play tournaments every year and less than 15 people world-wide would achieve the title of professional. So I decided to build a Go Server that rivaled the current king, that was implemented with borderline expired technology. I founded Kaya.gs along with a partner: from nothing to a playable server in about 2 months back in 2011. One of the biggest challenges was the business model. Playing on a server is free, so most servers live by the Freemium model. Some features and services would be unlocked with a membership. Because we would take a long time to build a competitive freemium model and to bootstrap with that strategy, we chose to crowdfund the project. There was a huge need for a new space, that would develop new features faster and be more modern than the current options: the crowdfunding campaign let us get funding in the order of 20.000U$S.  ‍"," The whole Kaya.gs project was quite the rollercoaster. From the frantic fixing of our crowdfunding campaign to the server’s first release which was Christmas! I still remember my family trying to get me to do a toast while I was talking with the first live users of the website. We had a blast going all against the current of standard product-releases. We released every Friday night and people would flock to the server just to see the new features. We gradually increased participation and the number of games. But our growth stalled, then our income, our motivation and our capacity to develop new features.  Kaya.gs failed for many reasons at the same time: it’s easy to see sometimes how any one thing that had been flipped could have given Kaya.gs a longer lifespan to fix other issues. I would categorize 3 big failures that fed on each other. The first was the product, and solely my responsibility. I was selling vision with Kaya.gs and that vision consumed resources and mind-share to build creative and innovative features but neglected the bread-butter. We had reliability issues with frequent server crashes, and that would make the playing experience unreliable. We should have made the core-features of the service iron-proof before building the innovative features. We cranked out 2 features a week in a space that was used to getting 1 feature every 3 years: that was part of our identity, but we were already so much ahead in those terms that we should have tended to the core experience. The second was engineering: we made huge technical blunders in terms of design and planning. This was due to our inexperience mostly and was in many ways unavoidable. It was a novel architecture, in a time where everyone was moving off to build mobile games. We built Kaya.gs with experimental features that were turned off by the browsers often, had no DevOps (I manually restarted crashed servers), and this eventually affected our capacity to develop itself.  The third one was morale. After a year working on it, we were running out of ramen-money and we were not seeing progress. Our progress deteriorated, and we were ineffective in addressing that. We started to have friction between the founders and that lowered productivity to a halt. When things aren’t going well, it turns a mechanism in your brain that wants it to fail fast, as if it is about survival in the long term. I have a lot of regrets about how I handled that with my co-founder, but in the end, I think it wasn’t about mismanagement, but that we were not making the progress we thought we would with the business.  Once our technical productivity was severely diminished, we ran out of funds and didn’t understand why our product was not attracting swarms of players, it was time to move on. I would have loved to keep the project alive as a side-gig, but it required significant technical effort to keep it alive, so when I got a job that could pay rent, I closed the server down and open-sourced the code. I frequently talked with the most hardcore users of the server, some of which donated a lot of money and effort. They understood I did the best I could, I was there every day, working every day, and they could see I was not having enough traction to make a living. I did not get angry emails, so I think people moved on!"," So many mistakes! I remember understanding for the first time what it means to become a sort of public figure. In a semi-private space of Kaya.gs (a private channel, but accessible for many people) I made a jokingly sarcastic comment about a user making an unreasonable request. It was the writing style of that space, which was not taboo or insulting. A user took a screenshot and made a huge fuss in another forum where that would be taboo: a classic case of Schadenfreude. The first time I had to learn about PR meant, about watching what you say and how you say it because it can be taken out of context.  This is related to another challenge we had: we wanted to be the Server where we would do everything for the user. Go Servers had a famous reputation of being trigger happy with banning and treating users with some contempt. Some servers would ban you for just mentioning other servers! We, on the other hand, created a place for users to vote on features and participate in product prioritization. This gave us invaluable feedback, but it was also unruly. Consumers are all-demanding and it’s particularly insidious with free/freemium products: when you give the user some power and they cannot exert it, they become detractors. A lesson that is very evident in services like Twitter or Reddit, where it's filled with people that post constantly every day, pay nothing and still deride the services they use. There were plenty of Engineering mistakes, but I think they stemmed from inexperience and from product direction. I wanted to build everything, so we had everything half-built. I would tell myself to focus on key features first, end-to-end, before moving on to the next one. Another thing I learned later in my career was being more data-driven. I should have picked the key metric (# of games) and made sure that was the metric that improved every single day. That would have done wonders for the three issues: would have focused Product, would have made Engineering easier by having fewer features and work better and would have raised Morale had we been successful at improving it.‍ ‍",,,," The first step was building an architecture for it and a demo for ourselves: could we feasible build the first responsive HTML real-time GO server? The tools were very new at the time: socket.io for Websockets, node.js for event emitting/channel management, Ruby for the server (with a microframework called Cuba). The front-end was made with jQuery, but a funny thing for the Front-end Geeks is that we build a React-like rendering engine to only update the correct components instead of re-drawing the entire page. With my partner we sat down together, we picked the tools and the design, and we started coding as fast as possible. One of the most magical moments in the process was the first time that we could place a stone in the board and it worked real-time: like hearing your baby speak! Technically there were many obstacles: WebSockets was not reliable enough for many browsers and browser setups: the javascript community did not offer nearly as many tools and projects as it did later on so you had to build a lot from scratch. And games are *hard*. And real-time games with time-sensitivity are even harder.  We wanted to crowdfund the project in Idea.me, a Kickstarter-like company that was made in Argentina (because Kickstarter was not available for Argentina, and I think still isn’t). The day we launched the campaign since most of our users were outside the country, their donations were blocked by credit card companies and the sort. Nobody could pay. So we shut the project down from the idea.me website, and built one on our own website overnight, with Paypal. One of the fondest memories was naming the funding section on the website “Candy” with pink colored cues and icons. People found it hilarious that their curiosity led them to find that “Candy” was actually us asking them for money. We priced much like a Kickstarter campaign, different Tiers meant different perks and benefits, but mostly subjective. It was borderline a donation, because what people wanted was to see a new player in space more than anything else.",," In 2011 I went to Korea to study Go while secluded in the mountains. That was my last chance to become the first Go professional player in South America. At one point the opportunity was offered to me, a dream I had had for a decade. But I thought that I would be so far off-the-top of the game that it wouldn’t be my best contribution to the game and the community. I wanted to use my software skills to build something for everyone, not only for myself to compete. At one point I was building an online Go school and had dozens of recurring paying users, but I ran into a huge roadblock: It was very hard to extend services officially to the biggest Go server in the West. This happened because the live servers of the time had been built a decade before and had a very limited vision of what could be done: they didn’t see themselves as a platform for the expansion of Go activities as much as a technical feat of being able to play the game online. Kaya.gs was a very unique project for many reasons, but what got people really excited was the vision: the idea that something new and exciting would happen and that the community would be able to thrive with new community-oriented features. We had huge participation from the users in what had to be built, and even extended an Open Source part of the project for other developers to build AI’s, time systems and tournament systems. Back then I had had only about 1 year of web software engineering experience which will be an important piece of information later on. I had worked with startups and loved the ethos of building something for people that wanted it. ‍"," Gabriel, you need to sort out your execution risk. You don’t have the technical expertise to run all of this so make sure you get the right people to help in time to avoid pitfalls or build a team around it. And focus: make sure that what you are building is the right thing to build, every single day. Build for impact, even if it’s boring. Forget about the bells and whistles! ‍"," I think Crowdfunding campaigns are fantastic for games. The people that donate become evangelists of the project, love being involved and share actively with people. We also had a very active feedback channel in a public forum, where we were the only official Server that responded to user inquiries. That gave us a huge influx of users and feedback. We had over 300 special account users, some of which individually contributed over 100U$S each. This was significant for the space because we didn’t yet offer a superior product, but the promise of one. (A funny story is that a user donated 100U$S with bitcoin at the time, which was around 3 dollars each. We sold the bitcoins when it hit 60U$S, thinking we hit the jackpot!) The most difficult part of growing a new Go server is the chicken-egg problem: it’s a market place between players of different strengths, and if you don’t have enough players you don’t get enough players. We attacked this problem in many ways: we organized prized tournaments, we added passive activities that engaged users for longer periods and would mean more presence. One of our most effective tools was to add bots that made it so a large number of players could play even if they found no (human) opponents. We used to have about 100 people online constantly, and we had 10’s of thousands of registered users. The number of games played was well over 10.000.  ‍", This might be a good opportunity for me to open up my portfolio page into a blog since I wanted to do that before. My port-folio page is conanbatt.com., I am a YC fanatic. I enjoy Paul Graham’s essays and Hacker News for startup/entrepreneurial information. But what I would recommend someone the most in any business is making sure you know the domain. Understanding what you are building and for whom is the most important Product detail of everything. That’s why most successful companies are built by people that make a product for themselves or for industry they work in. ‍," Our key expenses were our own living expenses. We lived on a ramen-budget after technical expenses. Infrastructure and Engineering costs were low. I think this is one part we did right, very low expenses gave us a year of runway with 20.000U$S. What we lost the most, of course, is on opportunity cost. Our monthly revenue was about 2,000U$S but the model had ups and downs. We knew that if we grew our user base we would have to add another kind of subscription service to fund ourselves long-term, but we did fantastically for what the space could do back then. ‍",Entertainment,Poor Product,Argentina,"March 12, 2020",Gabriel Benmergui,https://www.failory.com/interview/kaya-gs,['http://conanbatt.com'],failure,0,,"In 2011, Gabriel decided to build a Go Server that would launch new features every few weeks.

120,kimp," I’m Senthu Velnayagam, and I’m the Co-Founder of Kimp. I’m mainly based in Canada - though I’m often traveling to connect with my team members who are based in different countries. Kimp is a subscription-based design company that offers graphic design and video design for a flat monthly fee. As a Co-Founder, I wear a lot of different hats but my main focus is on growth and innovation. I’m always looking at how we can improve and optimize our service. ‍",," In addition to the pivot, the early stages of the pandemic are no doubt at the top of the list. Trying to connect with team members across regions and time zones when we were used to collaborating in-person and real-time was a big challenge. Especially given how much our team members rely on and support one another. Finding team members who are the right fit, remotely, is an ongoing challenge. It’s one we’ve overcome with some roles, but still face with others. We want to continue building a supportive, creative culture for our team, especially as we’re working remotely. But recruiting remotely can make assessing that quite a challenge. In terms of mistakes, there’s nothing much that I would call the worst because our missteps have often led to finding new ways to do things. Like building out our CRM and productivity tools to measure and assess how we’re doing. If I had to choose I’d say it’s pushing ourselves too hard. Burnout is tough to bounce back from. And while you want to give your customers a great experience, and support your team members to the fullest of your abilities, you have to step back from time to time to rest and recharge. ‍",," Today we’ve thankfully weathered the pandemic fairly well, and are operating as an entirely remote company. When the pandemic began, like any other business we were anxious about the safety of our team members, our clients and weren’t sure how we’d be moving forward. At that point last year we’d been operating for about a year and a few months, and our teams in different locations operated out of physical offices together. In having to shift to remote operations and establish new workflows we realized we could also expand our team to new regions. It had been on our radar to eventually explore this type of expansion. But in a world of remote work new opportunities came up. Our team is now dispersed across the Asia-Pacific region, North America, as well as Central and South America.  In terms of our goals for growth, we want to create employee hubs in each region that we have teams. In these spaces, we want to create not only training and social initiatives for our team members, but also training opportunities for aspiring designers. While we will continue operating remotely, we hope that the pandemic will soon be on the decline, and make way for a return to some level of in-person interactions. We’re also really excited about the custom software we’re building for our clients to enhance their experience of the service. “Kimp 360” as it’s known internally is going to be a completely customized project management tool that will make it easier to request, organize and access designs. It’ll also include resources to help clients looking for inspiration or best practices for designs that get a higher ROI. And internally it’ll provide our team with a greater level of insight into the client experience and client needs and interactions. We currently use a customized Trello dashboard for each client. And while we love Trello and it’s been a great way to work with clients, there’s just a lot more that we want to be able to give our clients over time.",," We took inspiration from what we already saw on the market for subscription-based design. And then started breaking down what we thought others in the market were doing well, what we could do better, and identifying any gaps that we could see.  And we were doing all this while pivoting from our previous businesses. It felt like months of walking on eggshells, trying to keep up with existing clients to who we’d committed projects. And then trying to build and launch a new brand, along with its operations. With revenue from BannersMall and Doto being used to bootstrap Kimp we were burning the candle at both ends. But in hindsight, there were a lot of blessings in disguise during that time. A few of our most recent hires that had been made to help expand Doto now became big players in launching Kimp. And through Kimp we’ve been able to give new opportunities to our team members to grow. And to serve clients around the world whereas we were previously focused on North America. For years we didn’t know if we could gain traction anywhere else. But within a month of launching, we were already getting uptake from multiple regions. Our initial launch was done fairly quietly as a soft launch. There was a lot we were trying to tweak, but we wanted to get proof of concept too. So we began reaching out to past clients to see if they’d be interested in trying Kimp out.  And we also started running social media ads. A couple of our campaigns took off and we saw a huge influx in sign-ups between the end of February and throughout March. So much so that we were often building our workflows as fast as we were breaking them. And oftentimes relying on client feedback to gain insight into our blind spots so that we could account for them. Near the end of April 2019, it felt like we were hitting a stride. This was definitely in part a result of bringing on more team members. And having some breathing room to look at how we were doing and where we wanted to go. For instance, adding in a video design subscription as we continuously received requests from clients. And then rebranding our subscriptions to Kimp Graphics, Kimp Video, and Kimp Graphics + Video. ‍",," Before I started Kimp I was a bit of a serial entrepreneur, launching and running a few different design startups. I started as a one-man operation, designing web banners back in 2003. Those were the early days of digital marketing and I was able to find clients on marketing forums. There was a shortage of designers for web banners, and that was fortunate for me in a couple of ways. I was a horrible designer at first. But I loved it and I was looking for work. To make it easier to land a job I set up an eCommerce site called BannersMall.com. And pretty soon one job led to another, and I had way more work than I could handle. Including brands like HostGator, Endurance International Group, and Russell Brunson. Between 2003-2007 I partnered with an LA-based designer named Chris Hevoyan. After a few great years, Chris moved on to other projects and I partnered with my brother, Ven who is also a Co-Founder of Kimp. Ven and I worked together to grow BannersMall and then launch Doto (a design agency so that we could take on the more complex projects that our clients kept bringing our way.) For a few years, we continued focusing on web banners for digital marketers through BannersMall. And we did this alongside more extensive design projects, motion graphics, and website design and development for other clients. We were doing great, business was booming and we were able to hire quite a few designers as well. But then about 3 years ago a steady decline started. On the BannersMall side of business, competitors had not only sprung up, but they’d innovated too. Meanwhile, we’d kept just things going steady. So our customers started increasingly opting for other services. On the Doto side of the business, we had that fatal flaw that a lot of agencies struggle with. Our bottom line was much too dependent on the big accounts of a few clients. When 2017 rolled around most of our work was with clients in the real estate and property development industries. Recognizing this we’d started building out some proprietary software for them, and positioning ourselves to secure more clients as a real estate/development marketing and design specialists. But with the market’s fluctuations, our client’s marketing and design budgets also took a big dip. And at what felt like breakneck speed we had to pivot. We had an awesome group of designers depending on us. And even with all of the upheaval we were experiencing, we knew there were a lot of other industries that would continue to need design services on an ongoing basis. So as we started bleeding money we went through different business models and landed back on subscription-based graphic design. We’d thought about tackling it in 2015. But at the time we were already spreading ourselves pretty thin. Now with everything on the line we dove in. I’d initially learned about unlimited graphic design when I found out about Design Pickle. The company had turned design into a productized service with huge success. And we believed we could put our twist on it. Enter, Kimp. ‍"," I’ve always valued my team and their many strengths, but in the past few years, I’ve come to realize just how powerful it is when we work together. There were so many moments that I wasn’t sure if we’d make it. But we pulled through and pushed each other to keep going. I wouldn’t say this is a new lesson learned since launching Kimp, but once that’s been reinforced. Your team matters so much more than your vision. Because without the first the second is going nowhere. Another lesson that I’d say is tied to launching Kimp is around business growth, development, and innovation. In my previous businesses, we were often reacting to our clients’ needs. But with Kimp I’m always pushing to see how we can innovate and optimize our processes and offerings. If we hadn’t pivoted, Kimp would have never existed. And we would have just lost everything after 15 years of running our design businesses. But in going beyond what we thought we could do, we’ve realized more of what we can. And I’m going to keep pushing that ceiling. ‍"," After launching Kimp, we’ve relied on a combination of social media marketing, affiliate marketing, referral marketing, and Google Ads in particular. We’ve found each of these methods to be fairly effective so far, with the caveat that at times social media marketing can be a bit tricky/unpredictable as algorithms shift. Apart from these different marketing channels, we’ve also been very particular about our messaging and copy. We try to ensure that we’re always highlighting the aspects of our service that are unique to others in the subscription-based design space. ‍"," To find out more about Kimp, the best place to turn is our site of course. And we also regularly update our blog and social media (find @getkimp on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn) with examples of our work."," We love Trello. It allowed us to get up and running faster than we could have if we waited to build out a project management tool first. And it’s highly effective and intuitive for our clients and team members. For internal projects we rely on Basecamp and to document processes, we’re using Notion. We use Zapier to build in automation and different integrations. Our website’s live chat is operated through Crisp and we use Flock to share instant messages and updates within the team. We’ve also built some tools for ourselves as well, including our CRM and a web app to track individual projects, and overall account metrics. AppSumo is a great resource for deals on software and up-and-coming tools. You can get lifetime deals on there as an early adopter! In terms of inspiration and business insights, I read a lot of ebooks and guides from marketers and entrepreneurs. I can always count on Product Hunt, G2, Reddit, and Facebook Groups to find some great reads. And as far as all-time favorites I’d recommend Expert Secrets and Dotcom Secrets by Russell Brunson, The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, and Looptail by Bruce Poon Tip. Russell Brunson’s books provide great tips for scaling a business online. The Lean Startup drives home that need for constant innovation. And Looptail is a great read for any entrepreneur, especially if you're feeling a bit worn out by the daily grind. In it, the Founder of G Adventures shares his incredible story of building a business without compromising his values. ‍",,Design,,Canada,"May 4, 2021",Senthu Velnayagam,https://www.failory.com/interview/kimp,"['https://go.kimp.io/failory-interview', 'https://go.kimp.io/failory-interview', 'https://www.kimp.io/blog']",success,1,No Data,"Senthu co-founded Kimp, a subscription-based design company that offers graphic design and video design for a flat monthly fee.

121,knownet," Hi there Rich, thanks for taking the time to hear our story! I’m a fan of your work at Failory and enjoy learning from the other entrepreneurs. Currently, my business partner Antonio (Ari) Iaccarino and I have launched Ridj-it , an online carpool platform for outdoor enthusiasts, matching those who need a ride to outdoor adventures (think hiking, skiing, camping, horseback riding, wine tasting, rock climbing, yoga, kayaking, rappelling, and even axe throwing!) with someone who can get them to these destinations and back. So far, this endeavour has definitely not been a failure like KnowNet (which I will get to shortly!), and in fact, we’ve seen substantial growth in the number of users and overall use in the last few months. We are operating out of the Boston area and look to expand to other East Coast cities. Before jumping into the KnowNet debacle, I’d like to touch upon how we arrived at Ridj-it - I think it will be a good way to introduce ourselves and offer an insight into what makes us tick. Ridj-it was an idea that we conceived on the way back from a hiking trip in the White Mountains in my then car, a 1997 Camry that graciously did not fall apart despite the more than 300,000 miles it racked up or from whatever was causing the repetitive popping noises on the rear right (or the entire rear, if we are being honest). At the time, I was going to grad school at night, studying epidemiology and biostatistics while working full time as a medical researcher, and Ari was an adjunct professor teaching ESL students in several schools and also tutoring. An escape to the outdoors was a welcome break from our crazy day-to-day routine, plus we loved hiking. After bagging three peaks in a grueling hike, Ari and I mused about how our hiking trips were really just limited to us and anyone else who could hitch a ride with me. Ari opined that at least only a few souls had to put up with my terrible music playlist, which consisted of whatever Boston stations that could still be salvaged as we went North on I-93, a rock station that kept playing old Green Day and The Offspring, or any other frequencies of garbled, static-y mix of bluegrass, sports radio, and Bible recitations. He made a good point. Ari then posed a curious question: how does someone like his students, who are internationals without American driver’s licenses and awareness of the area’s outdoor offerings but who enjoy activities like hiking, able to easily get to the Whites for a hike? I pondered for a bit but couldn’t provide an answer and neither could he, which is rare because both of us have a lot to say about everything. I then thought about my grad student friends who enjoyed hiking, and it turns out that they relied on me, both for access and awareness. So, if I were to not go hiking, nor could they. I also reflected on various meetups, social and outing clubs, and college organizations - the traditional gatekeepers to these types of activities true, these groups do enable organized hiking events, but everything  is on the group leadership’s terms, the events for many of these groups are relatively infrequent, membership can be pricey, and there’s no reliable and consistent transit available apart from hoping someone would offer a ride or on the off chance that one of the groups booked a bus or van. We learned later that these groups are often steeped in unwelcoming social cliques and layered in unnecessary top-down bureaucracy, making accessibility to the outdoors even more untenable for folks like Ari’s students and my friends. But it wasn’t just internationals and grad students with large barriers to entry a lack of reliable and consistent transport from an urban core like Boston to various popular destinations in far-flung places like a trailhead in the Whites would also impact a large percentage of urban dwellers, which includes those who have eschewed car ownership as a necessity of city living, people of color who have been systematically deprived from accessing and enjoying outdoor recreation, and young, transient professionals who find owning a car to be unnecessary and costly. Through various conversations with each other, we asked ourselves the following: What if we could provide both a direct link and a bypass via an online platform that fosters a reliable and consistent (and affordable) transport program to hard-to-reach outdoor destinations and a network to folks that share similar hobbies, that doesn’t require engaging the tribal ingroup/outgroup politics of the gatekeepers? We agreed to bring this concept to fruition over burgers and milkshakes at our post-hike go-to diner in New Hampshire. Two years later, after research, experimentation, and refinement of our concept, Ridj-it has a fully functioning website with an active and growing user base, a great deal due to Alex Nikitin, who joins Ridj-it as a co-founder and lead developer, and to Liz, Nick, and John for their help in marketing, product development, and graphic design. Ridj-it was named after Franconia Ridge, the trail that we hiked that day. While working on growing Ridj-it and ensuring that it fulfills its mission, I also work full time as a data analyst in the healthcare space, Ari is a public school teacher, and Alex is a software developer at a local university.   Prior to our work with Ridj-it, Ari and I also embarked on an idea for an on-demand tutoring platform called KnowNet. The idea, which came to us about four years ago, was to enable those who needed tutoring to quickly find a tutor to offer guidance for an issue that the former encountered during the course of study. KnowNet never took off because a simple SWOT analysis revealed that there were too many competitors with advanced products and VC backing. We failed before we could even begin. ‍"," At the time, we stopped working on the idea because there were too many competitors who had VC backing, paying customers, and were in incubators. We went to work on fleshing out the high-level details of KnowNet before Ari suggested that we conduct a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis, something he picked up through his university course Management for English Schools course.  We spent about two hours identifying threats and we found a handful of very impressive platforms that more or less did what we had come up with. Needless to say, we were quite deflated at having our idea shot down so quickly, but in hindsight, we realized it was a very safe form of failure. We also realized later after our work with Ridj-it that it was OK if there was another business out there that has already taken our idea in a world of 7.5 billion people, this notion should not be a surprise. Implementation, marketing, tailoring your product to bring repeating enthusiastic customers, and a bit of luck are all rather important, and a budding entrepreneur should consider those factors too and not solely whether a similar product is already available. What also prevented us from moving forward, while we wouldn’t necessarily understand it four years ago, was our lack of experience and skillsets in tech at that point plus the lack of funds. ‍"," I think we were trying to bite off more than we can chew without fully appreciating the type of effort and know-how that was required for running a startup. We simply did not have the skillsets at the time to bring the idea to a product, and we also did not have the funds or resources to obtain that type of help the SWOT analysis saved us from learning this the hard way. With Ridj-it, we found that having access to money and being good at managing money, having work experience, and ability to pick up skills as needed were important predictors of success. Our mistake, apart from trying to competing with established competitors, was not being prepared enough to manage a start-up. ‍",,," The two biggest disadvantages for us were: 1) not having the proper skillsets or maturity to implement and run KnowNet, 2) several big competitors.",,," KnowNet was born from our experiences as tutors. Ari and I both tutored extensively - he primarily served the ESL (English as a Second Language) community both as a tutor and university/public school classroom instructor, and I tutored high school and college students in Math and Sciences, in addition to my day job at the time as a multiple sclerosis researcher. Ari and I would touch base with each other about our students’ progress and our styles of teaching. Over time, we realized something: though our subject areas were different, there was a notable pattern with both of our groups, which for a lack of a better term, we called the “threshold effect.” And for a lack of a better definition, we proposed that the “threshold effect” was when a student transitions from not understanding a particular concept (especially one where much effort had been applied) to understanding that particular concept, and they additionally overcome a cognitive block whereby many related concepts suddenly make sense when they hadn’t before. In other words, the understanding of that one hard-to-grasp concept led to a global understanding of the subject in unison. We noted that the student’s overall performance in the subject also improved following the “threshold effect.”   Given the all or nothing outcome of the “threshold effect”, we posited that optimal tutorial help could come at a point, during the course of studying or doing homework, when a student was near but had not overcome the threshold. So, if a student is studying and needed that immediate extra bit of help in understanding a concept to cross that threshold, we reasoned that a platform with on-demand tutorial services could have a positive outsized impact on the student’s performance in a class or subject. That then was our motivation for KnowNet. The tutoring sessions would have been conducted online through the KnowNet platform, with built-in online whiteboards and video streaming capabilities. But that was the extent to the details of the platform that we had vetted out before calling it quits. We had not come up with a pricing model, nor had we even broached upon the nuances of how interaction would take place between the student and the tutor. ‍"," No. This was a necessary fail for us. It was a learning experience and it was humbling. ‍   I learned: Always do a SWOT analysis.If there are a lot of competitors, do not let it be the only reason to end the venture. It should be considered in conjunction with other potential issues.Start by implementing the idea with the lowest tech possible to achieve the desired business goals, and start scaling and refining after learning about the particular needs of the customers.A certain level of preparedness and maturity is needed.    I have 3 pieces of advice: Find some to talk to about your idea. Someone you trust and whose opinion you value. Don’t bottle it up inside because you’re scared they’ll steal your idea. They won’t.This might be trite, but make sure to focus on your MVP, and how you can make a barebones version of your ideal that you can bring to market.It is important to really want your idea to succeed, but make sure to make time to be around the people who are important to you and to partake in activities that make you happy. There is no pride in working 80+ hours a week for the sake of working 80+ hours a week.  "," We, of course, did not get to a point beyond the idea stage with KnowNet, so we never got a chance to grow the business. Our initial plan was to reach out to nearby students through our contacts in the area, but before we could do that, we in fact needed tutors who were willing to participate (having the supply ahead of time before meeting demand), which was a fact that we didn’t appreciate at the time. In fact, with Ridj-it, the analogy was to actively pursue and market to drivers to ensure they were available to provide rides. Also, to reach students, we were aware that we had to market to their parents or caretakers, and so our marketing strategy would’ve included targeted mail campaigns to residences near schools, for example, or advertised to well-known blogs devoted to parenting (i.e., mommy blogs) and education. As a way to bring in tutors, we considered the prospect of offering tutoring companies a devoted place on the platform, as a marketplace for them to cast a wider net and get newer clients.", Please take a look at our current work on Ridj-it!

122,kolos," Hey there! My name is Ivaylo (Ivo) Kalburdzhiev, 31, living in Sofia, Bulgaria and in 2012 I spent 3 years of my life and $50,000 building something nobody wanted!  Sounds familiar?  KOLOS was the ‘world’s first’ iPad racing wheel that never was. You clamp it to any table, insert your 9.7” iPad and start playing your favorite tilt games instead of holding the tablet in the air.  I was the ‘genius’ (and CEO) behind the idea, and, as with any startup, I was doing a little bit of everything - marketing, business development, investor relations, customer support, prototyping, etc. "," No market need.  Knowing what people want and are ready to pay for it needs to happen before you build your product, not after.  So I would spend most of the entrepreneur’s initial journey on fanatically learning about customer needs and providing them a solution they actually care about, not one that the founder fell in love with.  Founders also need to be brutally honest with themselves about what they are building and whether it actually makes a difference in people’s lives. For example with KOLOS we weren’t hearing enough “I want and need this” but instead “I would get it for my son/nephew” (i.e. not the real customers).  Right after the Kickstarter campaign ended in early 2015, we shut down the operations and parted ways.  It was a natural decision that we didn’t even ‘take’ - we had decided if the Kickstarter doesn’t, there’s no need in pursuing anything beyond.  Even before the crowdfunding campaign started, I felt ‘comfort’ inside that whatever happens, will be for the best and that it’s time to either fly or ‘die’.   "," First and foremost avoiding talking to customers. When I say ‘avoiding’, I mean that I intuitively knew it was the right thing to do, but I still didn’t get the courage to do it in fears I would get rejected. I also felt I knew better, thinking that I understood the problems people were facing, so there was just ‘no need’ for additional customer discovery talks.  Why waste that precious time? I also felt uncomfortable talking about it with strangers, so these are all fears founders must overcome in order to get good at getting to know their customers.  The other huge mistake I made was to take out a loan to start the business.  The failure rate among startups is so high that it’s simply not worth risking your own money. Instead aim for accelerators, incubators, and angel/VC money.  Better yet, before even talking to them, I would focus on validating the demand first before ever jumping into those conversations which can usually take months.",,,," Short answer? The wrong way.  Instead of using DIY materials like wood or off-the-shelf parts of gaming accessories to test if the idea was even worth it, I went straight to the bank, took a huge loan and then paid industrial designers to start working on the 3D models.  After those were done, I paid literally thousands of dollars for super expensive prototyping online (Shapeways.com) since the models were big and bulky to create.  I also paid someone to write my own business plan, I used the loan money to fix my old car, and essentially found numerous ways to not spend the money wisely.   At the time I was doing my day job and studying, so at some point after 2 years in development, I decided to launch it on Indiegogo.com. Naturally, at around $100 a piece, no one bought it. I also had little idea of how to run a crowdfunding campaign.  I still didn’t give up. Later, after countless rejections from accelerators and investors, me and my co-founder got accepted into the Buildit hardware accelerator where we spent 3 months and another $20,000 on the business.  Shortly after, we finally had to find a way to launch it as we were running out of money. In early 2015, a Kickstarter campaign followed where we raised $4,000 and had to shut down the campaign shortly after.",," Great question and one that many founders probably do not ask themselves but jump straight into building a business.  My motive?  Just the idea of having a startup. The idea that I was ‘brilliant’, and smart, and I was going to build something new and cool, and show it for the world to see.  As a student, and working as a customer support rep at the time, I always knew I was going to be an entrepreneur, so there was my chance to ‘prove it’.  Yet still, I had: Zero previous knowledge of building startups and raising capital.  Zero-knowledge of mobile gaming, hardware, and prototyping. Just a big (read: useless) diploma in Marketing.  Heck, I didn’t even own an iPad. I bought one after I came up with the idea. 'Brilliant', ey? ",," We didn’t ‘go to market’ so we used 2 main methods of acquiring leads prior to launching on crowdfunding. Facebook ads and PR. We sucked hard at ads as it’s complicated and successful Facebook campaigns require enough budget for testing (which we didn’t have).  We were relatively good at PR (and something I used once KOLOS failed to get my first clients). P.S. my Paint skills were that good though: And since we were out of money, we were using some ‘creative’ growth hacking techniques like looking through Facebook groups of iPad gamers and sending them friend requests, then ‘pitching’ them KOLOS.  Eventually we had an email list of less than 500 people which was way below what was needed for an even remotely successful launch on Kickstarter. The conversion rates on the page were also pretty bad which was the main factor that contributed to the failure.  Post-factum we found out people just don’t care about the problems we made-u… ehm, were ‘solving’ with the wheel.  "," Since the KOLOS failure in early 2015, I’ve been helping numerous tech startups raise over $7M on Kickstarter and Indiegogo through my own consulting company: DayOneFunding. I’ve also been the campaign manager for the 15th largest tech Kickstarter in history - Superscreen ($2.5M) and currently sit as the #1 'Most Viewed Writer' in Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Crowdfunding on Quora.  Since early 2019, I have been partnering with the superb 80+ team at TheCrowdfundingFormula to make million-dollar hardware campaigns.  I would encourage anyone to get in touch if you/they know someone with an amazing gadget that could be the next big thing.  "," Honestly, the entrepreneurial materials these days are so abundant that just reading the top 100 business/biography books on Amazon would skyrocket one’s chances of success 100x - the leverage is exponential, drawing from other people’s experience/failures/successes. Still, nothing beats battles on the ground, so practice what you read and aim to be the best in your field, regardless of what you are building - it’s the only way to stand out and get noticed.   ‍"," We had ‘burned’ a total of $50,000.  $30,000 was the loan money. $20,000 was the investment done by the Buildit accelerator. These don’t include the funds I had to take from friends and family to make ends meet.  The Kickstarter campaign raised $4,000 total from 48 backers (some of which were my own friends who didn’t even have an iPad) which were then returned to the supporters since Kickstarter is an ‘all-or-nothing’ model.

Kopely was a mobile-based stress relief app designed for the consumer market.  Our mission was to provide practical and tactical stress management tools to our consumers leveraging an array of proven psychological methods like relaxation therapy, cognitive psychology, and acceptance, and commitment therapy. How were we different? Our app was focusing on how to actually help people manage their stress by using prompting them actionable coping strategies when they were in the moment of experiencing a stressor and by educating the consumer with perspective-shifting psychology to shift their mindset toward optimism to prevent the ill effects of future stressors.  As the Founder of Kopely, I was juggling several hats - managing the vision with our small team of developers, finding strategic partners like stress relief experts, and executing on our marketing strategy to onboard early adopters prior to our BETA launch The business model was based on our competitors' like Headspace and Calm freemium pricing options. We were going to release a two-week free trial with tools to assess your stress pre and post-trial than a premium full version for a monthly fee.  ‍"," Things were going so well for Kopely that it is still hard to accept failure. Kopely was killed because of the global pandemic, COVID-19. When the pandemic hit the US shores around mid-March I hadn’t heard from the dev group for weeks. I didn’t read too much into it since there was so much unrest in the world and the dev group was a worldwide group with developers throughout Europe.  After a month of no contact, I started to entertain the notion that Kopely may be shelved since it wasn’t necessarily a high priority project and wasn’t driving revenue for the dev group. Then a few weeks later I received a phone call from the owner of the dev group. Kopely was officially done. He just couldn’t commit the time and energy of his developers to a company that wasn’t driving revenue. He had his own worries- Covid-19 forced him to furlough some of his team and he had to focus all of his energies on keeping his own business afloat. Although at the moment I completely understood his decision, I just couldn’t believe that all of the work we did ended with this result and there was nothing we could do about it. I didn’t have the financial ability to personal fund Kopely and no one was in a position to shell out that type of money during such uncertain times. After we hung up, I remember I just left my apartment and walked around for a while trying to comprehend the news and what the heck would I do now. Many people were supporting Kopely- friends, family, clients, and a whole new community who were interested in our app and I wanted to tell them as soon as I could that Kopely would not be launching in July 2020 and will be indefinitely on pause.  I pulled all of my emails together from several of Kopely’s mailing list and sent out a mass email explaining the effects of COVID-19 on Kopely. I also called the people who were closely supporting the project to share the new news. Then I shut down all of our marketing efforts. Reaching out to all of the influencers and media outlets to share our updates. The only thing that I have kept running is our website since it's a nominal expense. And I still have a small glimmer of hope that Kopely could become a reality in the future."," I definitely made a lot of mistakes when building Kopely but I think the failure of Kopely was out of our control.  Outside of COVID-19,  one of my biggest mistakes was trying to compete against monster companies like Headspace and Calm. Some people thought I was crazy that I was trying to compete with companies who had a marketing budget that was 1,000,000x more than ours. But, I still felt that Kopely was a unique offering and I was so passionate about delivering better tools around stress management (that weren’t meditation) that I didn’t care. I also found it really difficult to explain to people that we weren’t a meditation app. When I told people that Kopely was a stress relief app their brains went immediately to meditation apps.  And, it was really hard to drive interest with such a small (nearly non-existent) marketing budget. I love grassroots marketing but I found it really hard to compete online. I wish I had more of a marketing budget to attract early adopters more quickly.  ‍",,,," Kopely’s business model was conceived in October 2019. After sharing my pitch deck to friends, family, and my personal training clients I started pricing how much it cost to actually build an app that would be living in Apple’s app store. After gaining quotes from several developers I quickly learned that capital was going to be one of my biggest hurdles in developing Kopely. On average the Kopely beta was quoted to cost $150,000- $200,000 and a full-featured app was $500,000- $2,000,000. The costs were well out of my affordability. As I contemplated raising angel money I came to the conclusion that I just couldn’t take people’s money without having more proof of concept. I started to live in online stress, psychology, and self-improvement forums to better understand people's pain points.  As I was doing my market research I was asking around for app developer referrals. Soon, one of my training clients recommended that I sit down with the owner of a dev group that he has used for his software companies. After several meetings and sharing his personal interest in health and wellness, he made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. He and his team of developers would build Kopely in exchange for equity. We were planning to launch the BETA in July 2020. When the dev group got on board, the process was invigatoring! When we hung up after our call I literally jumped and screamed with excitement. I was blown away that someone recognized Kopely and me as a risk they were willing to take. In short, my dreams were coming true! ‍",," As a young person, I realized just how much my own brain got in the way of my athletic performance, relationships, and personal life. I had a really hard time with stress and confidence, especially when the stakes were high.  Curious by my own weaknesses I decided to pursue my formal education in psychology (undergraduate and a graduate degree in psychology).  Then, after my last decade of coaching and watching the effects of stress, anxiety, and depression across the globe I started to realize that stress may be one of the biggest problems to solve for humans.  I thought that with my education, experience, and vision, Kopely could contribute to helping solve this massive problem. Prior to Kopely, I had two “side hustle” attempts, “ableboxes” and “enhanceables.com”. Since my personal training business focuses on servicing many technology entrepreneurs I was eager to try to scale another business.  In short, ableboxes was a “personal trainer” in a box. This pre-packaged box offered several small pieces of equipment, workouts, and a video library. Enhanceable.com was a health and fitness content aggregator. Like Reddit (kind of), I was aggregating the beat health and fitness content to our website then having our community upvote or downvote content based on its value and trustworthiness.  I learned a lot from these two failed businesses (which included over $15,000). I learned that you have to: 1) have a clear problem that you want to solve for 2) streamline your solution so people understand what it is 3) figure out how the heck you’re going to get people to care about your solution.", I have thought a lot about this question but I wouldn’t tell my former self anything. I could tell him to not launch a new product during a global pandemic but no one could have predicted such a thing would happen.  Kopely was my most thoughtful side project to date. I have learned a lot from my previous mistakes and I have to say Kopely was on a really good trajectory until COVID-19.  ‍," I knew that marketing was absolutely essential to grow Kopely. From December 2019 to March 2020 I was doing everything I could to start pre-selling the Kopely free-trial app and onboard as many new customers as possible. I was spending every minute I could outside of my other obligations to stir up interest on online forums, attack specific keywords with SEO, run Facebook ads, and connect with health and wellness media sites for potential product launch coverage.  After 2 months of hard work, I started to gain traction. My SEO efforts were paying off. We saw an increase of organic traffic and conversion of new subscribers, my Facebook ADs started to bring in a steady stream of new subscribers and I just started to connect with health and wellness bloggers and media outlets. My marketing efforts really started to kick in and then the COVID-19 pandemic happened.  "," Like many people, COVID-19 has killed Kopely and greatly affected my in-person personal training business. In an attempt to adapt and navigate these new quarantine restrictions I have been building a bigger fitness presence online.  I am launching a new concept called Korrective. We are offering on-demand programs to help people overcome repetitive strain injuries (like low back pain) and poor posture from the common lifestyle woes of sitting too much and spending too much time on smart devices.  To learn more about Korrective and me, head over to our website and check out our blog for free workouts and exercise guides!"," I read a lot but none that would relate to entrepreneurs. But, I am a huge fan of Tim Ferriss’s and Joe Rogan's Podcast for entrepreneurs. Since their podcasts are long format I think it gives you a helpful insight on what actually happens in starting a startup.  ‍", This is an interesting question since the dev group was accruing most of the expenses and taking most of the financial risk. My initial investment was: $60 logo design$300 graphic illustrations $20 p/ month website$12 p/ month domain  Revenue = $0 My biggest investment was my sweat equity. I put in a lot of hours to build Kopely as quickly as possible. On average I would say I put in 20 hours a week from October to March (480 total hours).‍ ‍,Health,Dependence on Others,United States,"June 24, 2020",Andrew Laux,https://www.failory.com/interview/kopely,"['https://www.korrective.com/', 'https://www.korrective.com/post/best-low-back-pain-stretches']",failure,0,,"After a decade of training and coaching, Andrew realized that stress was one of their clients’ main issues. That’s how he thought about creating a stress relief app. He partnered up with a dev company to build his idea while he took care of marketing.

124,leadsbridge," Hi! My name is Stefan, I’m 33 years old and I live in Italy. I am the CEO and co-founder of LeadsBridge, an all-in-one Lead Generation platform that helps companies collect more leads online. Through our technology, we already helped more than ten thousand small-medium businesses and enterprises to collect over 25 million leads. At the moment, my main focus is to grow LeadsBridge on the Sales and Marketing side. ‍",," Our greatest challenge has been the lack of a structure to meet the exponential growth of the project. As our revenues started to grow significantly, we realized that very small decisions could have very big impacts on the entire business, both in positive and negative terms. We had to structure LeadsBridge as a real company and be mindful about our weaknesses. Something that helped us immensely was looking at the metrics and taking our most important decisions based on that. For example, we started crossing the website data (Google Analytics) with our MRR, cash flow and churn. Then we started to pay closer attention to the multiple touch points data instead than just to the last one, in order to understand better our sources of conversion. On another level, we started optimizing every single step of the workflow of our micro-teams, from developers to marketers, since managing a remote team is extremely challenging. Last but not least, keeping on crafting the best plans for our customers had a huge impact on our revenues. When we started split-testing multiple solutions and implement new ideas faster, we gained more feedback and we started to control our business better, which benefited both our revenues and customer satisfaction. ‍  Well, we made a lot of them! One time we started an ad campaign with our landing page down, and we lost a lot of money. Another time we messed up with the check-out page, and so we lost again lots of clients and money. Then we launched products that were very hard for our clients to adopt, so we had to design everything again from scratch losing hundreds of hours of work. But hey, I am so grateful for all the mistakes because we learned so much from them and they fueled our growth. ‍",,," The greatest disadvantage has been entering a market like the Martech and Adtech ones, where competitors are very similar in their value proposition and it’s super hard to stand out. The hardest part about that, is to reach the right target audience by breaching through the noise and make them perceive that you are actually different than others. In this regard, one thing we did successfully was to offer an outstanding customer support to our clients. It might seem too simplistic, but it made - and still makes - a huge difference. Contrary to many customers support out there, we implemented the best practices of never say: “I’m not able to help you”, but finding a way at all costs, until the customer says “I’m good, thanks”. Plus, we do that in the shortest amount of time as possible, because you are going to lose tons of customers if you just leave them hanging. Thanks to this and other strategies, we were able to differentiate ourselves enough from other big players and get a slice of the cake too."," Well, it all started with by paying attention to the needs of the market. I was reading different influencers blog and I observed the great enthusiasm around Facebook Lead Ads. Despite the hype, people were still worried about how to sync their leads with their CRMs and ESPs. We did a very brief market research, gathered feedback on our idea and then started working on it. We didn’t need massive validation since we approached the project as a side business. Still, we worked our asses off for three months during weekends. In the beginning, it was just the two of us, the co-founders. We started as simple as everyone else: a WordPress website and an app that interfaced with Facebook’s API. We didn’t have any particular obstacle on our way. After the first marketing campaigns, we started making sales. We only invested a few bucks in advertising with an almost immediate positive ROI. As I mentioned before, the project had traction from the very beginning and so we started bringing in more people. Looking backward I can say it was the perfect process to bootstrap it to where it is now.",," Well, I always loved doing business. I started to work from a very young age as a door-to-door salesman first and then helping companies with their marketing strategies. Then later on, in 2006, I met the Digital Marketing world and since then I’ve built my entire career on it, driven by an inextinguishable curiosity for all of its facets. As I went deep into it, I started to specialize in email marketing, marketing automation, and lead generation. I used to partner up with professional across many businesses, from mechanics to wedding planners to psychologists, who wanted to monetize their skills. They brought their knowledge to the table, and I helped them sell it online, for example by helping them to make videos and create paid courses. One day I met Alessio with the same intention to help him out. He was a very talented developer and since we were a good fit, we decided to partner up. This time though, we decided to do something different. Instead of selling his skills and teaching other people how to code, we decided to develop a few projects together. We started by solving a few problems that many marketers were facing in their businesses. Our first project did really well and in a matter of months, it was already generating $10k/month. So, we decided to invest also in another project on the side. Since I had been in the market for a few years, I knew that one of the major pain points of marketers was connecting Facebook Lead Ads to their CRMs. So, we built LeadsBridge to solve that problem, starting with a very basic MVP.  I knew it had the potential to help many people, but I couldn’t anticipate its success. Soon it became our main focus of interest, and we kept investing in it in proportion to the traction it was generating. Two years and 1M$ in revenues after, it’s still growing strong. ‍"," For sure I would grow the team much faster. Obviously, there is some resistance to hire new people when you grow your project. It’s hard to trust others and delegate responsibilities, but so far it has always paid off greatly, giving us a great boost in terms of talent, creativity and results. If I could go back in time, I would do that sooner. We would have grown at least at double the speed! ‍"," A solid content marketing strategy and then Google Adwords. Facebook Ads are very helpful too, but what really made a difference for us was creating highly converting landing pages and then using Google Adwords to promote our content. Also, we have always been very flexible in our strategy, discarding what didn’t work and doubling down on what did work. Another important aspect of our marketing strategy was to establish partnerships. Building a network of partners of the same industry helped us reach great visibility and get traffic at scale. Last but not least, the Intercom Sales Chat. I know that many people still look at it as a simple helpdesk tool. But it’s much more than that. It’s what allowed our sales managers to make visitors comfortable to talk with us, book demos to discover our products and ultimately becoming new customers. ‍"," To learn more about what we do, check out our website or blog. We also have a Twitter account, a Facebook page, a profile on Medium and a YouTube channel. We hope to see you there!"," One important advice I would give to anyone who is about to start up a project is: don’t do it without an analytical background and some proper marketing skills. It’s going to be hell otherwise. These skills are too important to start any sustainable entrepreneurial endeavor, so make sure to have them or hire someone who does.  As a resource to check out, I would recommend reading ""The Lean Startup"" by Eric Ries, which is very practical and inspiring. On a similar page I would suggest to check out the work of Pieter Levels and his new book “Make” on how to bootstrap profitable startups. On a broader perspective, a very important book to read in my opinion is “Exponential organizations” by Salim Ismail, which really breaks down how today’s most impactful companies grow so fast without the need to increase their assets in a linear way, but simply leveraging the exponential technologies available. In addition to that, to keep up to date with the best articles and insights on digital marketing I would highly recommend to check out the GrowthHackers community - whereas for sales and negotiation a really nice source of inspiration is the TV show “Shark Tank”. ‍",,Software & Hardware,,Italy,"February 21, 2019",Stefan Des,https://www.failory.com/interview/leadsbridge,"['http://leadsbridge.io/2InXjDQ', 'http://leadsbridge.com/blog/', 'https://twitter.com/LeadsBridge', 'https://www.facebook.com/leadsbridgeapp/', 'https://medium.com/@leadsbridge', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCml6sDXzUSHTJarxe327J3g']",success,1,$100k-$500k/mo,"In 2015, Alessio and Stefan partnered up to start building LeadsBridge, an all-in-one lead generation platform that helps companies collect more leads online.

125,legaats," Hello! I’m Deepak. I grew up in Ecuador, my parents are Indian, and I was born in Kenya! I came to the US 7 years ago for college. Up until a year ago, most of my experience was in finance, but was always inclined to start my own business. I quit my last job at BofAML to take a few months off and try to start my own thing. About a year ago, I started Legaats(social platform where baby boomers share & document nuggets of wisdom to pass on to future generations). After 7 months full time, I decided to evolve the business to what now is The Lobby. The Lobby is a marketplace where job candidates buy 1-on-1 calls with employees at top investment banks to get personalized recruiting advice and the chance to earn an employee referral.  "," The main reasons were: a) too slow to validate assumptions, b) no clear business model, c) lack of empathy with target users, d) not enjoying execution, and e) no unique competitive advantage. In more detail: ‍ Too slow to validate assumptions: In a previous version of this article, I said that our main problem was not having a tech co-founder for this specific idea. In hindsight, that was wrong. Not having a tech cofounder hindered our ability to build technology quickly & cheaply, but the reality is that we could have done dozens of cheap low-tech experiments to validate our core assumptions (i.e. do senior citizens alleviate social isolation by documenting life lessons using an online product? How easy is this behavior for a typically non-tech savvy audience?) I was too obsessed with trying to build something just to show people in the industry that I had built some sort of digital product, when in reality it would have been much smarter to validate our core idea quickly and spending as little as possible. Our current venture, The Lobby was validated through an unpaid LinkedIn status and spreadsheets, where we made hundreds of dollars without writing a single line of code and without any technical person involved. ‍ No clear business model: I may be wrong, but I think we’re way past the age where you can build a consumer-facing startup without a clear business model and hope to monetize once you have millions of users. I’m sure there still will be success stories in this realm, but with the dominance of FB and Google in the ad-space, it’s hard to see the trend that made companies like Yik Yak and Secret big prevailing. Legaats didn’t have a clear business model, and the only ones I could think of (such as charging for storage) were really not well thought out or validated. With the trends discussed, I think it’s now more important than ever to have a clearer picture of your business model even in the earliest days of your company.   Lack of empathy with target users: After reading my grandfather’s autobiography, I thought everyone would want to know this kind of stuff about their own ancestors. Thus, I convinced myself that my experience was enough of a passion-driver that I’d figure out how to replicate this sensation for people everywhere. The reality is much more subtle & nuanced. I started building a solution for an audience I fundamentally could not empathize with. I enjoyed mentorship and reading wisdom-type content from my grandfather, on Quora, and on Medium, but I did not understand what it took to actually get people of that age group to actually create it, and frequently. How could I assume seniors solve their social isolation by using a web app? Maybe they just need their own families to visit them more? I’m sure someone will build something that alleviates this demographic’s isolation issue, but it will probably come from someone who can deploy a much higher degree of empathy with this audience than I ever could.   Not enjoying the execution: This was the one I least expected, but probably the single most important reason I stopped working on Legaats. All the learnings above could have made me choose to pivot our model or probe into a more focused, tangible problem to solve for this audience however, because I wasn’t enjoying the execution I decided to do something different altogether. I was just not enjoying the most basic things about the process. I remember the first few meetings with my users who were 50+ years-old CEO’s, and I was deriving so much amazing wisdom & insight from them, it felt like a dream come true that this was my job. However, I quickly realized that one thing was enjoying my conversations with them, and another was getting them and myself to produce this content online. This was incredibly frustrating, difficult, and inefficient. Try explaining to 70 & 80-year olds how to write “blog-style” posts on a web app or to record videos of themselves giving advice and you’ll see what I mean. Again I’ll say, someone might figure this out, but I came to a conclusion that it should probably not be me. I think the biggest red flag was when I realized I didn’t even feel like getting my own grandmother to use the product.   No unfair competitive advantage: This last one was also very important to me. Up until Legaats, I had spent my entire life working on things that were extremely related to finance and business. Yet, here I was, trying to build a social digital product, where most conceivable success stories with those kinds of products started with at least one great coder on the team who put these products together for fun. Looking back, it was pretty presumptuous of me to think I was going to figure out some strategy to hook millions of people on to a web application without even understanding the basics of building a simple website, without ever having worked with engineers, or having someone with those skills by my side. That’s not to say it’s impossible, even for someone in my shoes — I just realized that life is short, and I’d probably prefer trying to start something where I actually have some unique insight or competitive advantage. My new startup idea is based upon my existing network of top professionals and is essentially solving a problem that I solved for myself and that I’ve helped dozens of others solve over the years as a hobby. In short, it’s a problem I know exists and it’s one that I understand. The execution is something I unconsciously enjoy because I’ve been doing it for so long on the side. Maybe our current solution isn’t the best way to solve it, but the fact that we got dozens of paying customers from day 1 with $0 investment is a much better start than what I was doing with Legaats. Also, I can have empathy with my users because I’ve been on both sides of that market, and I also have what I think is a unique insight, which seems to be driving some of our initial traction. If I didn’t have this insight or my network as an advantage, I probably would’ve moved on to another idea, given what I learned with Legaats.    We haven’t yet “succeeded” in The Lobby, but the experience with Legaats definitely helped me gain some meaningful perspective on how to truly solve a real problem, and not one that sounds plausible in my head. That, as well as most of the other lessons mentioned in here.  ",,,, Two big ones: a) inexperience on what it takes to cheaply validate startup ideas and b) not being the target user for my own product. Elaborated on above.,,," Legaats was a web app where baby boomers and senior citizens could store, categorize, and interactively share all their most important life lessons in video, text, or photo format to pass on to future generations. I was inspired by my own grandfather’s autobiography, where I learned a lot about his life and found lots of wisdom I didn’t get the chance to hear from him directly. I wanted to replicate that sensation everywhere, and I felt that no dominant consumer platform had succeeded in tapping the idea of building your “digital legacy.” I really loved the idea of mentorship & wisdom-sharing, so it made sense to me at the time. I also researched and found that half of the US population would be above the age of 50 by the end of 2017, that this age group controlled 70% of disposable income in the country and that they were suffering from the widespread epidemic of social isolation. Legaats was meant to help alleviate that problem!  "," It’s hard to answer this because this is how most of the people I respect learned the same hard lessons – by giving it a shot. However, in an ideal world, if I could go back with the knowledge I have today, this is how I would’ve gone about executing or at least validating Legaats: I would have started a YouTube channel where I would ask 3-5 families to post videos of their grandparents reciting life lessons and videos every week. This costs $0 and I would have truly been able to emulate the user behavior which is getting people of this age group to interact with technology and document pieces of wisdom. I would have then proceeded to collect arduous feedback on this entire process (i.e. did this make you feel better, how hard was this, etc.) and studied the challenges of getting people in this demographic to interact with technology as a solution to their emotional issues.  To be honest, I can’t tell you more because, with my new mentality, I would have done this long enough to then figure out my next step. It would have been a much more iterative process. I’d have saved tons of money doing things this way and still learned more about my users than what I did in 7 months with Legaats. I would also have focused much more harshly on potential business models before plunging into spending any money on development or deciding to pursue the idea. Lastly, I would have been much more ruthless on detaching myself from my idea. The more I think I can do this, the more merit whatever I choose to do will actually have.    One phrase to all my fellow solo nontechnical founders: ""You don’t need a web app, a product, or too much money to validate your idea."" Everything you’re saying or thinking to convince yourself that you do is not true, and you’ll have a much less painful experience if you listen to what I’m saying. Solve a real problem, and find the cheapest way possible to figure out if people give a crap about what you’re doing and if they’re willing to pay for it. Even with the most techie concepts, you can now build a landing page for free, spend $10-$50 on FB ads, and figure out if there’s demand for the product. You can also leverage tons of other existing technology to help you get you a cheap MVP that isn’t completely low-tech (YouTube channels, email newsletters, landing pages, spreadsheets, free trials of necessary tools, etc.).  "," For the initial user base, I attracted them organically through my own network. I’d tell friends about what I was working on, and they’d tell other friends who they thought might be interested. I’d grow the email list as best I could, and try to send out interviews & pieces of wisdom I’d score from top-notch executives that I knew people would want to read about. These executives were previous mentors, fathers of friends, and really random people I’d meet through warm introductions who were attracted to the concept."," Check out The Lobby and please send it to any friends trying to break into investment banking! We also have a YouTube channel for events we've hosted, with speakers such as the co-founder of Classpass, co-founder and CEO of Trigger, and head of growth at Velocity. I occasionally write on Medium and answer IB-related questions on Quora. Feel free to reach out at deepak@thelobby.io! Thanks for having me!"," My two favorite work-related books are Zero to One by Peter Thiel and Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Zero to One really helped me understand that in order to do unique or extraordinary things, you have to think in a unique way. By thinking like the rest of the world, it’s easy to follow what everyone else does or says and lose the ability to think individually and objectively. Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell reinforced a very important concept for me which is that there is no such thing as an overnight success. Every person who became successful “overnight” had countless hours of deliberate & hard work before they reached a point of visible success. This book is mostly a reminder that if I want to achieve my goals, I should focus on putting my head down and trying to get a little bit better every day, instead of trying to find shortcuts.  ",,Social Media,Bad Business Model,United States,"March 17, 2018",Deepak Chhugani,https://www.failory.com/interview/legaats,"['http://www.thelobby.io/', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDXs4CIJVdOrGIwNbPqMd-A?view_as=subscriber', 'https://medium.com/@deepakchhugani', 'https://www.quora.com/profile/Deepak-Chhugani', 'mailto:deepak@thelobby.io?subject=Failory%20Interview']",failure,0,,Legaats was a web app where baby boomers and senior citizens could share their important life lessons. 5 were the causes of its failure.,Legaats: Why I Stopped Pursuing My 1st Startup Idea
126,leilo," Hi! My name is Sol Broady, and I’m a 21-year-old senior at Columbia University in NYC. For the past three years, I have worked as the founder and CEO of Leilo, the world’s first dedicated relaxation CPG. Simply put, we are on a mission to de-stress a stressed-out world. Everyone knows where to go when it comes to energy or caffeine--soda, coffee, tea, energy drinks...the list goes on and on. But what products can you turn to when you need the opposite effect? What are you doing to relax, take the edge off after a long day, or balance out your caffeine fixation?  That’s where Leilo comes in. Using all-natural ingredients known for their anxiolytic properties, we provide “calm in a can” whenever you need it most. Our star ingredient is kava, a root native to the South Pacific that has been enjoyed for millennia for the euphoric and relaxing sensation it produces.  Crucially, our proprietary formula gives consumers a tangible effect without using any alcohol or marijuana derivatives. When you consider this alongside the fact that Leilo is vegan, kosher, halal, non-GMO, and as low as 10 calories, you could say we’ve made relaxation responsible. We’re proud to have created a product that not only makes people feel good but one that they can feel good about drinking in the first place.  Since our first flavor launch in March 2020, we’ve enjoyed pretty rapid success on both the e-commerce and retail fronts. Though the pandemic presented some obstacles in getting off the ground, we pushed through and are happy to report that we’re currently sold across 200+ retailers in 20 states, and are adding more by the day! With some awesome new flavors and function-specific variants coming out soon, we can’t wait to continue spreading relaxation across the nation, now and for years to come. ",," Beyond the COVID launch debacle, the most amusing challenge we ran into was found in the manufacturing of our new flavors. We went through two months in early 2021 when each batch of our Raspberry Hibiscus flavor turned to a glob of jello overnight in the carbonation tank. I remember having to write a lengthy email to a group of our angry retailers explaining that as much as we wanted to fulfill their orders for the new flavors, they’d be even madder at us if we shipped them this gelatinous mess of a product. Despite how frustrating that situation was, my team never gave up and kept tweaking until we found a solution. Interestingly enough, it was the manufacturing processes that we ended up inventing over that crazy period that allowed us to patent our process. What’s more, Raspberry Hibiscus has been our top seller ever since it came out. It’s funny how great challenges like this if overcome, can often yield the greatest rewards.  Looking back at it, we went through a lot of unnecessary suffering on the production and operations side because I refused to spend money on veteran personnel in the early going. I know this cuts counter to the bootstrapping mentality I’ve been talking about, but ingredient sourcing and manufacturing—F&B-related operations—is something I strongly recommend finding prior experience for if you do not have it yourself. As I was starting Leilo up, I had total confidence that effort and common sense could make up for an industry-hardened COO, and I was wrong. For instance, the first 15k cans of our Lemon-Ginger flavor were over-sweetened 10x with stevia and pretty much unusable in retail, setting us back almost a full quarter.  The replicable integrity of your product is everything once you hit the market, so it pays to have this set ahead of time by an expert. Find someone who can procure an impeccable supply chain and maintain steady production, and don’t let them go—they’re hard to find but indispensable in our line of business. While it may seem expensive at the time, it is undoubtedly cheaper than screwing up successive production runs due to inexperience. Ultimately, you’ll be forced to hire a professional anyway, so I recommend doing this from the onset and saving yourself a massive headache and lots of money.  ",," I’m happy to say that business is booming at the moment. With retail opening back up nationwide and the Leilo community expanding rapidly through both word-of-mouth and dedicated marketing efforts, we are poised for a huge back half of the year and explosive growth in 2022. Currently, we are on track to more than 10x revenue from last year and have a chance to crush that multiple if a couple of our potential large deals in the pipeline close as expected. Over the past 6 months, my team has transitioned from being composed of a  couple of hungry college students to industry professionals who have scaled major CPG brands throughout their careers. Back in the early days, it was just me and my three co-founders from college, struggling day-in and day-out to get this business off the ground. Now with 8 full-time employees and 30+ more sales reps and brand ambassadors across the country, we finally have the personnel and experience to start flying.  Over the next several quarters, we have a couple of primary goals. The first is to leverage the success we’ve seen in the NYC area into new markets, including California, Texas, and Florida. Another is to debut several functional-specific variants that meet the needs of specialty demographics. I am particularly excited for Leilo Luna, our melatonin-infused nighttime product, and Leilo Sport, a super low-calorie product with added electrolytes and amino acids for athletes post-workout.  Beyond that, we are constantly looking for ways to build our brand holistically and tap into other industries. If we are going to be known as the trusted brand in relaxation, we have to bring more to the table than simply our products. To this end, we are extremely excited to announce we’ve teamed up with NYCFC as their Official Relaxation Partner. Leilo is the first “relaxation partner” in professional sports sponsorship history. We’re also venturing into the music and live event space as the title sponsor of several festivals and concerts throughout the US.  My ultimate goal is for Leilo to be the “Red Bull of Relaxation,” a brand synonymous with relaxation itself. We have a long way to go, but, at least so far, I believe we’re off to a promising start. ",," It took me about two full years to go from idea to product. Before sinking a bunch of money into the company, I felt it was essential to do as much research and low-budget development as I could on my own.  When I was first playing around with prototypes, my primary objective was to mitigate the natural bitterness of kava. The word “kava” in Fijian means “bitter” this reputation for unpalatability is one of the reasons why Americans especially are hesitant to try the ingredient for the first time. After much experimentation and research, I discovered that dairy and spice were two viable masking agents. I knew the eventual Leilo product line would be a carbonated soda/seltzer, but I was on a limited budget and more interested in people’s reactions to the functional effects of kava. So I started making these huge batches of horchata from scratch in friends’ kitchens at night after class and rugby practice. People would see me on the street carrying tons of milk, rice, cinnamon, and sugar and be pretty confused. It was fairly labor-intensive and there was certainly a learning curve, but I eventually got good at making my kava horchata. I would then package each batch in little 8oz bottles and take them to Columbia parties with me. It was amusing I got lots of stares and snickers as I showed up with a backpack full of hand-made horchata when most people were drinking Bud Light. Some people dumped it out without trying, while others let it sit in their fridge for weeks until it separated and looked very unappetizing. A few people thought I was nuts more thought I was wasting my time and money. I bring up this comical and self-deprecating story because I see many founders who are too apprehensive to release their product until they think it’s perfect. It’s a valid worry criticism is scary and hits hard. However, I believed it was far more important to start collecting feedback and data than it was to wait for perfection in a vacuum. I knew that my horchata wasn’t the optimal presentation of what Leilo would eventually be, but I figured that if I could get some consumers to appreciate an admittedly amateurish version of Leilo, I would only gain more believers in the product as I continued to refine and improve it. And the people who did try the horchata had positive reactions, giving me the market validity I needed to pursue more professional development. After all this experimentation, I finally felt strongly enough about my concept to take it to flavor houses for formulation and eventually co-packers for production. This was in late-2019/early-2020.  By March 2020, we were all set for take-off. But our launch turned out to be a complete disaster because I impeccably timed it with the initial COVID outbreak in NYC. We had retailers set up across Columbia University, launch events throughout the city, and lots of cool demos mapped out. The day before our scheduled rollout, we got evicted from our dorms and sent home. My team was suddenly scattered across the country, our retail agreements in LA and NYC fell through as those markets shut down for several months, and we had to immediately pivot to DTC sales almost exclusively. I think that was a valuable lesson in maintaining optimism and agility in the face of dynamic circumstances. You can create the most detailed business plans, but life rarely shakes out how you predict it. The pandemic is an extreme and unusual example in this regard, but looking back at it, being forced to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances gave me and my team the confidence to grapple with whatever surprises might come our way in the future.  ",," I grew up in Santa Monica, California with my parents and three younger siblings. From an early age, I’ve found myself in highly competitive environments that can often turn quite stressful. The school I attended through 8th grade, Brentwood, was pretty rigorous, and it was hectic balancing schoolwork with the sports I played. I was fortunate enough to have been surrounded by some great role models—my mom and dad, coaches, and teachers—who encouraged me to take on challenges and responsibility without sacrificing wellness or perspective. Nonetheless, I found it tricky to obtain this balance day in and day out. For high school, I decided to set off on my path to expand my horizons, leaving LA to attend boarding school at Hotchkiss in Lakeville, CT. Looking back on it, it’s wild to think that I made such a major life decision at the age of 14, but I’m glad I opted to push myself. Hotchkiss was very tough academically––despite the talent of the students there, I witnessed a lot of my peers burning themselves out by the end of it. At the time, I was also playing quarterback for the football team working towards college recruitment added its unique pressure on top of everything else, and the combination bordered on overwhelming. When I started college at Columbia University, it had become clear to me that something needed to be done about the stress culture I’d witnessed everywhere I’d gone. Though Brentwood, Hotchkiss, and Columbia are all very different places, I noticed a consistent thread of students engaging in the “work hard, play hard” mantra and eventually buckling under its weight. Don’t get me wrong—I believe it’s very important to stay ambitious and goal-oriented. However, I noticed that oftentimes the partying, drinking, etc that my friends and I thought was “balancing” out our hard work was only decreasing our productivity and leading to more stress over time. To reach my own goals—pursuing my major in Internal Relations and minor in Ancient History, playing on Columbia’s rugby team, and of course, growing Leilo—I realized that my habits had to become more sustainable. That’s why I’m so passionate about our product I use it every day to soothe my anxiety and stay grounded, and I’ve seen it make a similarly positive impact in my community. As I enter my senior year of college, it is clear that Leilo has made a major and necessary difference in my life, allowing me to tackle the challenge of each new day with calmness and confidence. As crazy as it sounds, the eureka moment to create Leilo came the very first time I tried kava in 2018. I was on a random and fortuitous family trip to Fiji, hanging out with some locals I had befriended in a village near Pacific Harbour. We were sitting in a circle in one of their homes, sipping kava, and speaking like old friends even though we had met only a couple of days before. The warmth, generosity, and sincerity of the Fijians, which they largely attributed to the calming, regenerative powers of kava, really stood out to me, especially in comparison to my experiences in the States. I felt extremely lucky to be included in this kava ceremony but simultaneously saddened that I couldn’t share it with everyone back home. I remember sitting at dinner with my family an hour or so after the kava ceremony, the dilemma still gnawing at me. Though it would be hard to top enjoying kava from coconut shells on an idyllic beach in the South Pacific, there had to be some way to share the magical properties of kava, as well as that culture of friendship and optimism, with a greater audience. To everyone at the table’s surprise, including myself, I declared that I would find a way to make an RTD kava product and bring it to market. Though it was a fledgling idea, and though I had no experience in the F&B space whatsoever at the time, they believed in me. A lot of progress has been made since that moment of inception, but I am proud to say that it is those same people, my family, and friends in Fiji, who continue to be my closest advisers and supporters. As Leilo continues to expand, it’s essential to me that my company does not stray from our roots and the hospitality, loyalty, and love that made all of this possible in the first place."," A common mistake I see in food and beverage startups is an insistence on idealistic assets from day one. People want to get everything exactly right from the jump, even before they’ve tested their product out. If you’re Mark Anthony Brands of Anheuser-Busch, you can afford to spend tons of money on fancy focus groups and killer marketing campaigns even for a brand-new product. But this approach is bound to fail if you started like me with a very limited budget and unproven track record. Scrappiness and ruthless self-criticism can take you a long way. Instead of a full-throttle launch, start small and controlled, leveraging your existing relationships for data collection. This sentiment is especially poignant for F&B startups as I’ve seen countless initial production runs go awry for brands, including my own. Young companies will commit to massive marketing spend and tie themselves to a major distribution partner only to see their first batch of products turn out subpar and, in some cases, unusable. The money is wasted and the distributor drops them, creating a tough situation to dig oneself out of. By placing all your eggs in one basket, you can kneecap your company’s entire future by overcommitting to a certain path when you’re not fully prepared for it in the first place. At Leilo, we always remind ourselves this: “slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.” It is far better in my opinion to exercise patient and cautious spending in these early stages than to go all-in and hope for the best possible outcome, which honestly rarely happens. Focus your efforts on connecting with a reasonable number of individual consumers instead of attempting to conquer an entire regional market all at once. Afford yourself multiple opportunities to make mistakes and learn from them—once you are unwaveringly confident in your personnel, product, and ability to persevere, then proceed at full force. While the cycle of development and redevelopment can be frustrating, you and your company will be better served by it in the long run.  ‍"," By far the most effective marketing strategy we employ is on-the-ground sampling and education. We certainly see a positive uptick from our work with micro-influencers, implementation of paid social ads, etc, but consumers are increasingly aware and averse to advertisements in their feeds.  With a new and unique product like Leilo, it’s hard to convey our entire value proposition in a 10-second video on Instagram. Consumers need to try our flavors, feel Leilo’s effects, and learn about our story from the people who built the company. While we continue to advertise digitally, we’ve allocated an increasing amount of our marketing spend towards person-to-person interaction, with in-store demos, pop-ups throughout our key markets, and event sponsorships, to give consumers a more holistic relaxation experience.  At the end of the day, it’s not the number of followers on social platforms that carries you, but rather the loyal customer base you cultivate who will consistently pick your product up off the shelves. While I understand the urge to focus heavily on e-commerce and social media capital, you can’t forget about the human element of marketing and growth.  "," You can follow us on our social media @drinkleilo (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, etc) and on our website."," I am a strong proponent of doing as much as you possibly can on your own before enlisting the help of consultants. That is not to say that these types of professionals are not necessary you will come to a point where you need to bring them on. However, you will not maximize the skills of a consultant unless you have an existing foundation for them to analyze and work off of. For instance, I spent 6 months creating my imperfect Leilo prototypes before I felt ready to hire a professional formulator—smoothies, horchata, sodas, you name it. By the time I began my conversations with them, I could present them with hundreds of feedback forms on various flavor combinations, functional dosages, and packaging types. By striking out on my own, I saved myself tens of thousands of dollars in development costs, but far more importantly was able to distill the vision for Leilo and present my formulators with a succinct and actionable agenda. In my estimation, this significantly increased the odds of my consultants creating a product I was happy with if I had gone to them from the onset, I’d be paying someone to fulfill a vision that I couldn’t even see clearly at that stage. There will always be an urge to bring in professionals I say resist it until progress is unachievable without their help and then pull the trigger with full confidence. More broadly, I see a lot of people talking about entrepreneurship instead of living it. I didn’t wait for an accelerator, mentor, or club to approve my idea before I started pursuing it. I’m not saying these types of support organizations can’t have utility for start-ups, but a lot of people think they’re a necessity. They’re not.  At least for Leilo, my job is to sell relaxation products, not to speak hypothetically about selling them with some people invested in a much larger portfolio of other companies.   In my opinion, experience is the best teacher. You absorb information faster, and the lessons mean more when you learn them for yourself. Go out and meet with store owners. Talk to your customers. Get roasted. Revise your formula. Tweak your packaging and taglines. Stay hungry, stay practical, and keep moving forward.  Great book to read: The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less” by Barry Schwartz  A role model in the CPG space: Dietrich Mateschitz, Co-Founder of Red Bull.

127,lemlist," My name is Guillaume, I’m 28 years old living in Paris and I’m the CEO and Co-Founder of lemlist, a cold email platform that allows sales teams to book more meetings thanks to the power of personalization. As a CEO, I’m taking care of management, strategy and sales, while my two technical co-founders handle the tech side. Before starting lemlist, I actually had a lead generation agency called LeadGuru, where I was essentially helping B2B startups scale and acquire more customers using cold emailing. Essentially, we were doing all the sales prospecting for our customers and we were asking them to pay per lead we brought them. After using various tools on the market, I felt pretty frustrated with the lack of personalization they were offering. That’s when I started building lemlist. We launched two and a half years ago, in 2018, after I sold my LeadGuru shares and stopped working on it. We currently have 8000+ customers worldwide, including well-known companies like Zendesk. It’s been quite the journey and we’ve put a lot of work into it. ‍  lemtalk ($60,000 ARR) is basically a live chat that allows you to connect all your messaging channels directly into Slack. For example, if someone sends an email to support, you can see it and reply all within Slack. This product was actually built before lemlist by my two co-founders. However, we decided to move it to what we now call the “lempire”, which is our series of products. Regarding lempod ($220,000 ARR), it allows you to get more views and more reach on LinkedIn. It was part of a problem we were facing, as every time I was posting on LinkedIn, I was copying my post URL and then asking the people I work with to engage.  So I once thought: “Damn, this is so stupid to do every time I publish a post. I’m wasting like so much time”. In 3-5 days we had the first version and we found many people had the same issue. We shared it in some groups and after two months, we had 1,000 users. That’s when we started charging for it and growing the price 25%/month. Since then, we have hired someone to work specifically on the product. We have processes documented on Notion in terms of growth, SEO, partnerships, communities, making everything much easier. Anyway, I had to hire someone, as well, to train this new employee. Right now, we're a team of ten. There are three co-founders, two people handling lemlist support, one person focused on growth, two more developers and one growth marketer for both lempod and lemtalk.",," The biggest challenge is growing, and doing it so at the same rate as in previous months.  The more you scale, the more challenges you get on the tech, marketing, and support side, so you really need to build processes. Things can go really fast and double in just a few months, and if you do so, you need to be ready to handle the load. ‍  I’ve already mentioned the UX and referral program mistakes. I think I’ve also committed some mistakes when it comes to hiring. We hired a developer who pretended to be really good, for example, to whom we paid a lot of money. However, as the days went on, we started realizing there were days he wasn’t working on lemlist but doing other things. When we asked him, he felt it was normal not to have told us about it before. He generated tons of bugs because the code was of poor quality and it was really a waste of time. We even tried to convince ourselves that we could train him and help him get better, but that didn’t happen. Right now, we're much more strict. If someone doesn’t fit the requirements that we have, we just fire him and that's all. I always recommend hiring and firing fast. Another mistake we committed was going after enterprises early on. After doing some prospecting in Silicon Valley, I met with Uber. We had five or six meetings and they were always super interested. I started spending a lot of time and then they started asking us about regulations, safety, security, etc. I was like holy shit. I started talking about it with my co-founders and everyone was super excited. But after looking at this, we realized it would require three to four months of development, just for a deal that we weren’t sure we’d be able to close. So we thought: “Let's focus on our main market, which is essentially SMEs and startups, and move on”. ‍",," In the next 3-5 years, we want to grow lemlist to $10M in ARR. At the same time, we would like to keep things simple and have a team that’s sharp and smart. A team of 15 by the end of the year would be enough. We’re also moving lemlist to be more multi-channel. Right now, we're 100% focused on cold emails but we will be adding calls, LinkedIn, Twitter, and pretty much every channel where you can do sales prospecting. The objective is to make salespeople’s life easier and help them book more meetings and close more deals. One important personal goal, that's not sure if it will happen or not, is to run the Iron Man in August. It's gonna be super challenging being 4 km swimming, then 180 km cycling and you end up with a marathon, so I need to start training at the beginning of March. ‍",," Building the product was pretty easy for my co-founders. They have been developing products for a long time. We had our first version ready within two weeks. That was surprising because, in my previous experiences with devs, everything used to take quite a bit of time. They used JavaScript frameworks called Meteor and Node, as well as MongoDB for the database. Pricing was simple in our case. After we’ve analyzed our competitors, the decision was to set a low price (around $19/month) for the basic version and we’ve increased it since then. However, it wasn’t all roses and sunshine in the early days, though. Our “activation rate” metric (when someone would sign up and launch a campaign) was low, as the UX of the product was far too complex. Along with some not so happy first paying users, this led us to re-think the whole UX. After fixing it, our activation metric increased by 100%. We lost a few users initially but acquired two or three times later on.",," I'm a Chemical Engineer (which has pretty much nothing to do with what I'm doing right now) and I’ve worked for companies like P&G and Hermés. Then I did a Master’s in marketing and this is where I started launching companies. I initially started a t-shirt business that didn't work really well, so I quickly moved on to LeadGuru with some friends. We made a bit of money, but I wasn’t really happy with such an unscalable business. At the same time, I was really intrigued by SaaS business models. I found it super interesting to be paying for different apps like Audible, which increased my curiosity around the software and tech space. Ultimately, I’ve decided to take a chance. With LeadGuru, we were within one of the biggest French incubators called STATION F. The two co-founders I partnered with on that project decided to move on from a company they were working on at the moment and we’ve ended partnering up to build something new. Since then, the idea hasn’t changed much. The differentiation factor was to bring personalization and cold emails together. But, as personalization of text already existed, we took it to the next level and introduced customization of images and landing pages. ‍",," Once the tool was built, my goal was to acquire users without spending any money. So I went with four channels: The first was cold outreach. How could we promote lemlist, a cold email tool, without using cold emails? I reached out to many potential buyers and they liked it, especially the personalization.The second one was communities. A great win was when I shared a screenshot of the beta product in a group of people sending cold emails and I received a ton of comments from people who were interested in trying it. However, a competitor who was in the group too announced they were launching a similar personalization feature to ours, so we started running to launch it first.The third was Product Hunt. We ended up on the #1 position of the day as people loved the idea behind it. But, it was hard to retain the users after that.The fourth was AppSumo. This is a platform where tools like lemlist offer access in a life-time way and for a super reduced price. In two weeks, we made $160,000 in revenue, selling thousands of licenses. Those were two exhausting weeks, where I answered tons of customer support messages, slept little, then woke up in the middle of the night just to answer some more, then back to bed, etc. From those $160k, we ended up with just $60k. But it was a great way to get a lot of traction and word-of-mouth rolling. We were also able to get a lot of feedback from users and money to invest back in the product. Being honest, AppSumo is worth it if your business is targeting SMBs, startups, agencies or business owners. And no, these people won’t upgrade to better plans afterward. But it’s a perfect way to get some funding and learn from customers. We’ve also tried out referral marketing in the past but ended up having problems. Initially, it was doing well, but then, during a holiday in Sri Lanka, I used Google to see how things were going just to find an affiliate member doing Adwords for that keyword. Digging into it, I found some partners were bidding on our name and stole our organic traffic. As our revenue share was pretty high, there were people making money doing simple AdWords campaigns. That’s when we decided to turn it off. As for ads, we haven’t done much. Customer acquisition costs on Facebook resulted to be quite cheap, but it wasn’t very accurate. We decided we wanted to keep it small, focus on the product, and maybe in the future, go on with Facebook & Google Ads. Retention, which was quite a problem at first, was great later on. The intention was to educate users as much as possible and avoid having people join without actually using the product. We’re currently at $1,000,000 in ARR. Between June 2019 and December 2019, we’ve generated huge growth, much faster than before. I think I’d attribute that to the compound effect, as we have been growing x%/month quite steadily.

128,lernin-games," I’m Jordi from Barcelona, Spain, and my background is in Applied Physics, but I have never worked in the physics industry. Started working in PwC as a consultant. Since then, I have always been involved in technology. In 2005 got married and moved to Caracas, started working in a small consulting firm, and that's when I started building products and companies. Since 2007, that's all I have done. Either by myself, with a co-founder, or joining early-stage startups in Latin America, the USA, and Spain. There I joined Wuaki TV, which is currently Rakuten TV. I was full-time employee number five, the CTO, and left in 2017.  After leaving, I started a company on EdTech. It was called Lernin Games and it was not a success. In this interview, I’ll be talking about its failure. For the last 18 months, I’ve been CTO at The Hotels Network. ‍"," The first time was when we were trying to raise some more money. We had a large VC fund that was interested and we had long conversations, but they didn't end up investing. All of a sudden, every answer we were getting was that it was great, but this is not the USA and having a free app is not the way to go. You need to show us revenue. We immediately changed the backlog to build a subscription-based app. We had less time to test it, and when you're building a B2C subscription app you need to test a lot. The earlier you can test, the better.  We started with a flexible approach. The more we forced everyone to go into a paid plan, either free trial or not, the revenue numbers were better. In the end, our numbers were decent enough. The issue is that we got there too late. During this time, my co-founder decided to step down from the company. I was alone, part of the team decided to leave also, and we became leaner. Our VC put some more money into the company. We tried it. I'm proud of the team that stood there to the last moment. We tried a lot of things that were not moving the needle enough and we didn't convert much more users than before. Unfortunately, I ended up in the hospital a couple of times. I realized my health and my family's mental health were much more important than the company."," User acquisition. You're fighting for the same bandwidth that kids have for free time. How do you make parents aware that you exist?  Second, the fact the kid wants to play those games, or that the parent forces the kid to play them is a huge barrier at those ages. Because it's much easier to watch videos on YouTube than interacting with an app. The kid’s timespan attention is limited. One of the biggest barriers was how to generate that engagement with kids. We aimed to provide value for parents with our reports. We were showing how much time the kid had played, what were the games he had played, what were the concepts we were trying to teach kids with those games, and how well or how bad they were doing with them. In the end, we never achieved such value for parents. ‍",,,," We built an MVP ourselves. Iñaki took care of the frontend and I took care of the backend and databases. We wanted to hire someone to help us with that and Iñaki was very reluctant. I am really happy that he was because I had to go back to coding which I hadn't done in a while. We spent from October to February building and launching our first application with 20 games. The KPIs we had were good enough. We visited five VC funds and all of them put a term sheet on the table. It was not only because the numbers were great, but also because the idea was good. On paper, we had been successful in the past with other startups and we complemented each other. If I were an investor, I would also have put money into the company.  We got a €1.5M seed round from K Fund and decided to hire a team. We were quite well known in the ecosystem and we had a good network, so we were able to recruit an outstanding team in a short period."," We used Google Adwords and Facebook Ads to acquire users. Our idea was to be a multi-language app. We didn't have the money to invest in tier one markets.  We investigated how the application worked in second-tier markets and we started spending money in Pakistan, India, and Southeast Asia. We found out that women were converting better than men, so we focused on them. It was a free application, and the numbers were excellent. We were in top positions in India and Pakistan and we got cold emails from large VC funds in those countries. But that was not our main target. It was a way of testing the product, and the acquisition channels. ‍"," The idea was not mine. It was from my co-founder Iñaki Ecenarro. When I was negotiating my way out of Wuaki, I spoke with many people from the Spanish startup ecosystem because I was trying to find out what to do.  After talking with Iñaki at an event, he told me he was thinking about launching a startup in HealthTech or EdTech and I told him that I didn't want to start anything from scratch. I had promised my wife and family that I would join either a large corporation with a good salary or a more mature startup. I had very good opportunities and lots of interviews. But he insisted and we agreed to have a coffee. We met at Starbucks and he showed me a small prototype he had built himself around the concept of kids from 2 to 6 years old, spending too much time with mobile devices and tablets. It was a fact that kids would always end up on YouTube and that parents give their phones and tablets to them as a way of having more free time. The idea was to bring to parents and kids something entertaining, but at the same time a learning experience. We would help them learn the basic stuff that you learn at kindergarten. The kid would be entertained and he would opt-in for that rather than going to YouTube. ‍"," First, I will try to raise less money and I would try to have a smaller team. I would also have a smaller office. Our idea was to have a larger office so we didn't have to move after one year. It wasn't super expensive, but I would try to be leaner.  Iñaki and I started other companies in the past, so we thought we could build the company smarter and work fewer hours. But if you start a company you have to realize the first couple of years you're gonna work your ass off. You have to put 120% of yourself there. We were not mentally there to do that. We didn't want to. It's not a nine-to-five job. We thought that having senior people will cover the lack of hours. We should have hired the right people for the stage of the company. We hired the right people for the two co-founders at that moment. Finally, I would have introduced a subscription or a revenue model from day one, and not after one year. ‍  You have to be ready to give 120% of yourself to the project. That's going to compromise your personal life, if you're not willing to do so you should not start a company, and it doesn't have to be a startup business. You have to be sure with whom you're doing it. They could be amazing engineers or marketeers, but they could be used to work in large corporations. You need to hire the right type of people for an early-stage company.  You need to start monetizing as soon as possible. You can grow without generating revenue in the US, but elsewhere revenue is key. Generate revenues from day one. ‍",, You can find me on Twitter and Linkedin.," VentureBeat and TechCrunch.

We found out the yearly subscription was bringing in money earlier than any other subscription. The CAC-LTV ratio was not the best, but at that time, we were trying to put more money into the bank so that the treasury was in better shape, knowing that we would have to move to a monthly subscription at some point.

129,lets-reach-success," Hey, I’m Lidiya K, a full-time freelance writer and lifestyle designer. I’m from Bulgaria, but after becoming location, independent setting up the online business and making just enough to afford a life in a better country, I relocated to Amsterdam, Netherlands, which is my ideal destination. My biggest project is Let’s Reach Success, which started as a personal blog where I wrote about personal development (my original passion), but has now turned into an authoritative site on anything related to personal, spiritual and business growth, and the foundation of my brand and business. While I’ve tested different ways to monetize my passion, together with many things on the side related to Internet Marketing, it turns out that it really is beneficial to have a platform online and this can be used in so many ways. Over the years, people started finding me through my site. Some wanted to contribute (I publish many guest posts), others to connect with me as they liked the story I share on my About page), plenty of people want to publish a sponsored post (these now make a big part of my monthly income), etc. ‍",," The biggest battle is with the doubts we all face in the beginning. I didn't know anyone in my life doing what I do, so basically, I had no real proof it was possible. That’s okay for me, though, as I’m not the type of person who relies on others for support and I got plenty of motivation from people I follow online and all the great success stories out there.  What helped me get through these doubts and the fear of failure was the dissatisfaction I had with my previous lifestyle. I wasn’t doing anything meaningful, wasn’t independent, wasn’t making the most of my time every day, and was constantly reminding myself that there must be something more to life. This mental state doesn’t let you stop doing things in order to find a way out of the system and create a better lifestyle and one on your own terms.  So years before I did anything online that made money, I was reading about those who did it and who succeeded. They all started from nothing (I’m a big fan of self-made millionaires), had no connections, capital or experience in the beginning. But the digital world makes it possible for anyone to enter, build something and earn. There’s another stage - that of boredom. You enter it after you’ve been working on your passion project for a while and see no results. I had to remind myself of my vision to stay on track. That meant I was still waking up earlier than I had to and dedicated time to my work related to what will one day be an online business. Even when there wasn’t any official work yet, I built the discipline of someone doing it full-time. Now it’s still the first thing I do when I start the day, and that feels just as right. The next challenge is distractions. I was reading a lot about zen and minimalism before I turned Let’s Reach Success into not just a blog but also a registered company in the country I moved to. And I did simplify my life long before I started adding other elements to it. That’s part of lifestyle design too. Removing the unnecessary, but also defining distractions and making sure you minimize them. That could be other people in your life, other goals you’re after, other projects you’re working on, the high expectations you have, your bad spending habits, your procrastination or laziness. All these were something I worked on, one thing at a time, to remove them. One of the best habits I ever developed was tracking everything I do. That allowed me to notice what works and do more of it, while removing the rest. For instance, here’s how my income has changed over the last year. Now, I’m ruthless with my time. I plan my work, prioritize, structure my days according to my prime time. You too should find out when you’re most productive, dedicate these hours only to your business and leave anything else for the rest of the day. ‍  Now that I think of it, every single thing was such a lesson, that I don’t wanna take it back. But here are some things that weren’t good ideas (although I did it all in my free time and am okay with such experiments as that’s how I got to know the publishing world in the first place):   Having a membership site I spent a ton of time researching the best membership plugins and made a big plan on how to set up and promote a membership site (which is no easy thing). Got one (great product, by the way) for around $100, did the setting up part, created specific pages, restricted old content, re-branded the site as it was now a platform offering premium content, and started writing content for members. After some time I realized I don’t know how to get people on board and my new, super practical content ended up being read by almost no one. So I accepted this failure, removed the plugin, made all content free again, and got back to how things were before. The thing is, I wanted to have the ideal recurring revenue model which still allowed me to keep writing but only for those who care enough to pay. But it’s a lot of hard work, I don’t know how to promote it (there are different techniques to market such a product), and it’s quite the responsibility to charge people on a monthly basis. But hey, I now know the ins and outs of this monetization model and took some lessons to other aspects of my work. ‍ Staying with BlueHost for too long I’m sorry to be mentioning names, but I just have to. I’ve been with Bluehost since the first day I moved to a self-hosted site, and they are really good for beginners. Affordable and one of the most popular hosting companies that everyone’s talking about. I then moved to a pro package, after which I signed up for WordPress managed hosting on a dedicated server. At some point, I was paying close to $500 per year, and getting the worst customer support experience, and downtime without any explanation. I was just done with it and earlier this month switched to WPX Hosting. So far, it’s been great. But I knew from before that they have wonderful support and a quality product built with WordPress in mind. I’m now much happier and saw immediate results in performance.",,," There are two: 1) Not forming connections: The blogging world is all about networking. And there were tens of times that I've said 'no' to potential opportunities. I know I don't work well in a team and not delegating things or allowing others to do what they do best, is still something that might be preventing me from growing. But, let's not forget that this is a lifestyle business, which is meant to be making just enough so a person can live the lifestyle they want. 2) Staying away from video: I tried to get out of my comfort zone and get on YouTube. I already know what I could be talking about. I would be documenting my journey (following Gary Vee's advice), but I just don't feel comfortable. I did have a podcast, but recently stopped it as I didn't find joy doing it anymore. It was part of my brand and online presence for a long time, but I'm okay with leaving things behind as our time and attention are limited. ‍"," I was a total newbie and that’s why I believe my story resonates with so many people. The world is full of aspiring bloggers who never set up a WordPress site and make that first post live. Or others who give up after a few months. The biggest thing that helped me be able to make a living and still do everything my way and enjoy it, is that I stucked to it and covered topics I was passionate about. It is indeed possible to make it (not too big, but just enough to have a nice lifestyle thanks to that) in a competitive niche. I targeted personal development. But now it’s also Entrepreneurship, Health, Lifestyle, Travel, Career, Finance, and more. The interesting this is that all this was happening as I myself was evolving. As a self-help enthusiast and a writer by nature, the magic happened only after I combined these two. Meaning, I defined my passion being personal growth and admitted to myself that I need to start writing and see where it takes me. It then became my hobby and my therapy, but I was also slowly building a blog. I didn’t know a single thing in the beginning. Not about the publishing world, not about blogging, making money online, building traffic, or designing a site with a CMS. But it’s easy, as long as you’re ready to invest the hours and focus necessary for that. There was never a business model. I just started with a simple wordpress.com site and kept it like that for a year. Then, I decided it’s time to invest as this blog was now sort of my portfolio. By that time I was already making my first money as a freelance writer, so no better way to build myself than to have more of my content published on the platform that I control. So I set up a hosting account and moved to wordpress.org. For the first years I was selling my self-published books on the website using WooCommerce, but now they are all on Amazon. Organic traffic itself was what brought attention, and also sponsors interested in linking to their website or mentioning their brand naturally from an article. Either I write it or they provide the content. I now often get around $100-$200 for a single quality piece that I publish in the form of a guest post. After I saw this business model became the best way to monetize the blog, I also invested more in better hosting, a premium theme (it now looks like a magazine-style blog and the focus is on content), optimized it better, started caring about rankings more, created a page for advertisers and did a few other things more professionally. I also do affiliate marketing, although it’s not yet a permanent part of my monthly income. I’m still testing, but what seems to work best and what I feel most comfortable with (like most other bloggers) is to simply talk about products I myself am using or am a fan of and include a link to them. No Amazon Associates, no Clickbank. Also, I was never a fan of ads and if you’re going to be creating a trusted resource and want to provide a great user experience, then Google AdSense isn’t an option. I focus on content, a lot of it, and quality. The good thing about the Internet is that this strategy still works. And spammy sites can’t do it better than you regardless of their budget, if you’re investing the time to create and distribute great content. ‍",,," As someone who built a powerful mindset before a powerful site, I can’t say there’s something like that. Most entrepreneurs say they wished they had started earlier. Sure, that could always be said. But it turns out that we start only when we are mentally prepared to handle the responsibility that comes with our new project. So it’s all good :) ‍"," I’m not good at social media, I’m not aggressively promoting my newsletter, and I’m not paying for advertisement. Optimizing my content for both search engines and visitors still works quite well. Together with the occasional backlink from a top site, be it from a guest post I wrote for them, or because they found a piece on Let’s Reach Success useful and added it as a resource. So, let’s talk about how I do SEO as a non-marketer. First, it’s something I’m interested in. It’s like a game and I like reading about it. I got familiar with the basics of on-page SEO early on, and over the years built the habit of writing this way. It’s yet another digital skill, really. Many of my posts are ranking for certain keywords without being written with that in mind, but just because that exact keyword is mentioned a few times throughout the content. However, I enjoy writing a big post every now and then (2000-3500 words) that’s a guide, but also optimized for a long keyword phrase. The latest one, for instance, was How to Become a Millionaire Online. A week after it was published, it appeared as #5 in the SERP.  The keyword research I do is pretty simple. I put a keyword I have in mind related to the topic I feel like writing about in Google Keyword Planner and look at the results. I save 5-10 of the ones that come up, which I like and which don’t have much competition but do have enough searches per month. You can easily rank for a keyword with 100-1K searches, but that could be more too. These results don’t need to be accurate, but what I do next is place the chosen keyword in Google and see what comes on the first page. The point is to have just one or two articles from top sites about this, to check out their content, and to know you can write a better and longer piece. Then you go ahead and write it, while including the keyword enough times."," Head over to Let’s Reach Success to see what’s going on. You can follow me on Twitter and Instagram. If you’re in the mood for reading one post of mine after this interview, I wanna share this one with you. It’s about the dark side of the entrepreneurial journey, but also about the beauty of it and how to overcome the difficulties to get to the good part."," I have what I like to call my online mentors. These are people I’ve been following for years now. Most are millionaires, self-made ones, who ditched their old lifestyle (usually in their 30s), made mistakes and learned from them, enjoyed their freedom then settled down, built a few businesses, some scaled, others kept their free lifestyle. But they all helped me as their thinking resonated with me. These are: - Tim Ferriss: for those just starting out, read his very first book (or just skim it) - The 4-Hour Workweek. Then head to his blog and start listening to his podcast. His new bestsellers Tools of Titans and Tribe of Mentors might be the only thing you need on your bookshelf, as they are a combination of the best life tips and business strategies from some of the most successful people in the world. - Mark Manson: His bestselling book The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck might interest you. Not really business advice, though, just life truths that will help you come to some deep realizations, take some big decisions, make changes in your life, and start living more. He helped me a lot. - Pat Flynn: He’s the go-to guy for many people about how to make money online and his income reports are a solid proof for that. I constantly go back to his blog to see what’s new, and I like his life story and how he got started in business. - Dan and Ian: These two are the location independent entrepreneurs that relocated to Asia back in the days and started building businesses and networking with other like-minded entrepreneurs. They introduced me to some interesting concepts regarding lifestyle design. - Tynan: Such an unusual guy. I like many of his habits and his way of living and thinking. It does take some reading, though, to get to the good stuff on his blog and start learning how to live smarter, manage your money and time better, and make sure you’re going after what you want in life. - Neil Patel: This is the only marketing guru you need in your life. I like heading to QuickSprout to see his recent articles. He’s the founder of KISSmetrics and Crazy Egg, so many things going on for that entrepreneur. - Gary Vaynerchuk: I hadn’t found him when I was starting out, but a bit later. However, his first book ‘Crush It’ was a game-changer for me as it was what helped me realize that not writing, but personal development was my passion. Writing was just the way I could share it with the world. When I combined these two, I started seeing results and it all felt right. By the way, in January he just released the next level version of that book, ‘Crushing It’. He’s an influencer, the owner of VaynerMedia ($150 million dollar company), and he’s making videos on a daily basis sharing the life of a CEO, meeting people, giving advice, and more. ‍",,Education,,Netherlands,"February 21, 2019",Lidiya K,https://www.failory.com/interview/lets-reach-success,"['https://letsreachsuccess.com/', 'https://twitter.com/lidiyasblog', 'https://www.instagram.com/letsreachsuccess/', 'https://letsreachsuccess.com/lonely-stressed-broke-entrepreneur/']",success,1,$0-$10k/mo,"Lidiya is a full-time freelance writer who has started Let's Reach Success, an authoritative site on anything related to personal, spiritual and business growth.

130,lieferoo," Hey there! My name is as Aazar - I am 29 years old and I am from Karachi, Pakistan. However, since 2014 I am living in Munich where I work as a marketing and business professional. I came to Germany, after working two years in a telecom company in Pakistan, with the objective of studying abroad - I am really enjoying it. Already in Germany, a few years ago I built Lieferoo, which basically was the BlaBlaCar (the long-distance Uber) for logistics and awkward items that couldn't be transported in packages. For example, if people wanted to move a cat, they would use Lieferoo, as they couldn’t transport it on a package. I was the founder and CEO of the company and my duties were everything related to marketing, sales, business plan, and finances. The business model of Lieferoo was based on a commission. We took 10% of the earnings that the people who traveled with the package earned. My first failed startups helped me build a next startup that is ECOMPLY.io. ECOMPLY is a GDPR SaaS solution for Digital Companies to get rid of GDPR documentation. (Managing Director) and my current role at VP Growth at Userpilot.com. Userpilot helps you increase user onboarding & adoption through powerful & event-driven product experiences. Code-Free. ‍"," The main cause of failure of Lieferoo was that I didn’t promote it correctly and the bad team fit. As for the team, the problems began when one of the co-founders moved back to Nepal. He stopped being passionate about the product. He was just a developer – He got thirty percent of the equity but he was not completely committed to the idea. We also had another problem which was that If you are a student in Germany, you can't have your own business. If you have your own business, then you have to go through a big process which includes visiting the city registration and telling them what you are doing - that’s a lot of paperwork and 9 months of approval to get started.. As I didn't want to go through that process, I hired a German who became the managing director of the company - he was just the guy charged of documentation. The problem was that this guy was not committed either passionate about the project. So, all in all, the team was a big problem. They weren’t passionate about the product and about the problem we were trying to tackle. They were just doing something they were curious about and interested about. As for the marketing problems, I did not put enough money in promotion. I didn’t go to enough events, or I didn’t post enough on Facebook groups about the product. A third problem was also that I didn’t speak German well enough. When Germans wrote on my website, I did not understand them really well. I could not talk to customers because of this same problem. And I think there was a fourth problem, related to German beliefs on crowd shipping and carpooling. Uber and AirBnB are not really working well in Germany. People tend not to trust each other enough. They thought - If I give a package to someone I don’t know, they can take it away from me. That’s why I went through insurance process at the same time as well. It's very difficult in Germany for people to trust in online services like that. Most of them think that it's a scam - having that trust in the people to a new service like Lieferoo was very difficult. And the payment was a big problem. I wanted to follow the BlaBlaCar model, so, initially, it was free. We took care of everything and then once the package was received, people had to pay. But they distrust this. The key moment that made me realize the website was going to fail was when I realized there were over 25 requests of products to be transported, but there was not even one shipment deliver. I understood people were not going to trust the product and that the shipping of products would be difficult. Another important moment was when hinted me to failure that I had this bear that I wanted to it to travel the whole world if traveled around 30 countries already by people to people but then the problem was and we used to take pictures of it, but then the beer was lost. Nowadays, after all the mistakes have been made, I think that I should have had to try one more pivot and move to the B2B market. I would have just said hey, you have some stuff extra offices and we have some stuff. The only reason why I didn’t do this was that I didn’t speak German. One lesson from this is that if you want to build a business in a specific market, you should at least know the language people in that market speak. By the end, there were only two people left in the team. That was when we realized that the team wasn’t working and that Lieferoo was a failed startup. So, we shut down. The good thing was that the startup was still in the MVP stage – nobody had put a lot of money on it. The biggest loss was time: we worked one and a half years on it. I learned a lot about team management, marketing, sales and idea validation. It cost me some hundreds of Euros, but it still was a really valuable learning which taught me not only how to manage startups but also who to trust."," My biggest challenge was that I didn’t know how to code or build applications. I was depending a lot on my co-founders, who weren’t really into the project so didn’t care about improving the site. I didn’t even know how the features of the platform work.  I still think that having a technical co-founder is a really great strategy. But I also think that a proper co-founder who works full-time on the project is also a key point. We were not full-time. Otherwise, things could have been different and if we worked with somebody originally from Germany, then it would have been much easier – we could have tried other traction channels too! As for disadvantages, there were some: I didn’t know how to programme and couldn’t speak German fluently.The team was not full-time and more focused on other things.The market of Lieferoo. There were no competitors, which nowadays I know it’s not a great signal. Every startup that tried to do something similar, failed. There were some international competitors, like for example in the U.S., where the market is much more open and people tend to trust more on online services. ‍",,,," So first of all, I did quite a lot of validation for Lieferoo. My first idea was to build a platform to connect people from Pakistan and Germany so that one person that was traveling to the other country could bring what another person in the other country wanted. I created a survey and shared it on different platforms so as to validate if this was something that people wanted. I also talked to around 100 people who used to travel. It took me around one or two months to figure out if this was something people needed. I even made a group on Facebook of people who were interested in bringing stuff from Pakistan to Germany or from Germany to Pakistan, and a lot of people joined it. Soon, a huge number of people were asking about what I wanted to build and I found a group of people on my Facebook who had the same problem. Many Pakistani friends also wanted to buy electronics and in Pakistan, it was much more expensive than in Germany. So, they started posting on Facebook asking if anyway knew someone who was traveling to Germany. That was when I realize I had to put more focus on the Facebook group. Anyway, only a few months before I realized that I have to pivot soon. Bringing stuff from abroad is pretty much risky because of two reasons: illegal drugs and taxes. Drugs was a really risky problem. The same with taxes, as if people wanted to bring something from Pakistan, they would have to pay tax on it. It was this weird combination and this operational problem which made me think that I had to pivot to domestic long-distance stuff, such as chairs, tables, etc. After a few months of working on the project, I finally launched Lieferoo website which looked like Airbnb but for domestic logistics. But I faced a big problem: People still did everything through Facebook and didn’t sign up to the platform. I really enjoy the process of building the platform because I never had built a website and a and a software product before - it was very interesting for me. I didn’t have to build it myself. I told my co-founder how I wanted the product to look like and he built it. The one smart thing I did was to co-found the project with a tech person I met in University. This way, I didn’t have to pay anything to a developer and it was quite easy and fast to make the MVP. People began signing up the project and putting stuff there that they needed to be transported. But really few people signed up in the supplier side. There were lots of things needed to be transported, but nobody to do it. I remember that a guy even wanted some stuff to be moved from Munich to San Francisco! There was one competitor of mine called Nimble which had the same problem. There were a lot of people putting stuff and nobody was able to take it. ‍",," I was working for a corporate Telecom company and in Pakistan for two years in B2B Corporate Sales and I saw that I wasn't growing enough. I was a really good sales & marketing person in that company, but I was not getting rewards enough. So, I started disliking my corporate life and the corporate structure. When I came to Germany as well, I started working for a big company that was acquired by Intel. But I soon understood that big companies were not my thing and that I had to join a startup. But rather than start working on my own business, I first wanted to have some experience in the startup industry so I joined a startup in Advertising Tech and that was my first startup experience. It was an incredible experience and I gain a lot of knowledge because I learned a lot about how startups work. My motivation to start Lieferoo was not only to make a lot of money but also to make some impact in the world. I also wanted to solve my personal problem which consisted of bringing things from Pakistan to Germany. I like a lot some unique stuff that is from Pakistan so I used to constantly ask my friends to bring me different things. Every time someone traveled to Pakistan I asked for certain things that couldn’t be found in Germany. But it then started to be quite annoying for me. I wanted to pay for someone who could just bring these things. I thought: “If people are paying other people to transport them, why wouldn’t people pay other people to transport them certain things?”. For example, the tea in Pakistan is very specific and I love it, but in Germany, it was really expensive. I soon also found that there were other people in Mexico and other cultural countries who wanted products from other parts of the world. That’s when I thought that I was solving a big problem. Before Lieferoo I was also studying consumer affairs and technology management at the Technical University of Munich. I wanted to move into only marketing as in Pakistan everything was marketed through traditional channels It’s great to emphasize that before Lieferoo, I also failed to build one business in a coaching center but we did not invest much time in it. ) This occurred when I was in University. I was really good in college at College Admissions, so I wanted to start a college admission test business so as to help people get into my University. It completely failed. The business idea was quite simple: we gave a free test version so that people could come to do it and receive the results and find if they were good enough for the college. If the results were low, they would come to a series of classes where we would teach them how to do the test properly. The failure reason was our location. We did these tests and classes in a small house located horribly where nobody could see it. Also, my target market wasn’t prepared to pay for the classes – they just wanted to see if they could pass the test (the majority didn’t)."," If you could talk to my former self before Lieferoo, I would tell him to focus on pivoting. Try to find a different way about how people are doing business and try to find traction there. When starting, I wished I had spent more time on idea validation and understanding the market, and less time on German bureaucracies. I also wish I had spent less time paying attention to the opinion of the first people. I know it sounds quite paradoxical as I am wishing I had spent more time on idea validation. But I now believe that when validating marketplaces, you have to do it in bulk. Maybe hundreds or thousands of people. ‍"," My marketing strategy was just Facebook – I worked as much as possible in the social platform because the whole Lieferoo audience was there. I tried to get people to find us using all Facebook tools, such as groups, personal posts, and pages. I never carried out any other digital marketing other than having a landing page website and putting it on Google. This was a big mistake! I never marketed it really well. I didn’t even invest in Facebook advertising. I should have actually not only talked to people but also put some money.

131,lifewave,"  I am an inventor first and a business Founder / CEO second. I launched LifeWave, a fast-growing health technology company, in San Diego in 2002. The company began selling products in 2004, and today it sells products in about 80 countries. With offices in Ireland, Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, and with Indonesia, Mexico, and South Korea on our radar for 2022/2023, we also ship our products from 13 warehouses located throughout the world. I continue to act as the CEO of LifeWave nearly 20 years after its initial launch.  LifeWave has always used an independent distributor business model to sell its products.  Our wearable technology is best served by individuals being able to share their personal experiences, their stories, with others. The company’s mission is to help people feel better, look younger, and lead more joyful lives. We do this through wellness products that tap into the body’s natural energy and resiliency, and through business opportunities that inspire personal and professional fulfillment. We’ve enjoyed rapid growth, which has captured the attention of Inc. Magazine, leading to the naming LifeWave to its list of fastest-growing companies multiple times, including the upcoming 2021 issue.  Our most popular line of products, led by X39, are our wafer-thin, virtually weightless phototherapy patches that healthcare consumers place on various areas of their bodies to deliver positive changes within their bodies I researched the technology for many years before I introduced my first LifeWave product, Energy Enhancer. Although the original audience for its first version was military personnel, the complete line of phototherapy patches has gone on to be available to anyone. ‍",," I think my biggest mistake in business has been trusting the wrong people in my earlier years. However, I learned from my experiences and am much more discerning now about who I let into our company’s inner circle. Every business professional will face some type of betrayal in their career because of human nature’s desire to get ahead, sometimes at all costs.  There is no question that trust is a major factor in any organization’s culture of success and we certainly work to make sure we build it across all departments, among all employees. As far as obstacles, there have been a few. Call them speedbumps, call them roadblocks, we have had our share.  But we’ve been able to successfully weather them and come through those challenging times stronger and more determined than ever. ‍",," LifeWave experienced its share of challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, but we are still in a good position. Our growth rate never slowed down, and looking back, our sales for 2021 are projected to be about 10 times what they were in 2018. As we look out upon the landscape of health, wellness, and the future of technology to serve humanity in the coming years, all of us at LifeWave are excited.  The innovation within our very busy labs is expected to create opportunities for us that will sustain our growth and momentum for years to come. Add in the expansion strategies we will be executing and we believe our future looks very promising.",,"  The development of every new product starts with prayer. I feel that prayer helps to relieve any anxiety I feel about the process and motivates me to create something that improves health across the world. Our team then conducts an online patent search to make sure we are not accidentally repeating someone else’s work.  Each new product, once a consumer need and demand is confirmed, goes through multiple phases from concept to completion, including conducting years of research in our San Diego laboratory. We put our products through rigorous studies with independent doctors and scientists to ensure the consumer receives accurate and expected results.  Then we start marketing and selling it.  I once worked for a company where I had to memorize a sales pitch about why a three-inch roll of tape was better than a two-inch roll of tape. I knew it was silly, but it was my job at the time. Once I left that job, I vowed to never use a sales pitch again. Selling a product like ours should involve natural conversations that seek to solve health problems for our customers.",,"  I have known I wanted to be an inventor since I was eight years old. That is the year that my parents took me to visit Thomas Edison’s original laboratory in New Jersey. A laboratory assistant who worked with Edison directly chose me to demonstrate how a piece of equipment on display operated.  I had my heart set on being an inventor from that point forward, but my dad told me that inventor jobs no longer existed. Undeterred, I developed more than 100 patents over the next 50 years. My dad later apologized, and we get a good laugh out of it to this day. However, I hope this serves as a lesson to anyone who does not initially feel supported in pursuing their dreams. People often ask me how I came up with the idea for LifeWave. I worked at a company called AAG in 1999 as part of a team that developed survival equipment for the United States Navy. The naval crew in charge of a mini-submarine had to remain awake for 30 consecutive hours, and I wanted to find a solution that did not involve using stimulants, drugs, or caffeine. I did research for three years before I launched LifeWave. It was a big moment for me because I believed so strongly in the ability to naturally stimulate the body’s metabolism without resorting to artificial means. "," I have learned to be resilient above all else. Life as an entrepreneur means people will experience good times and challenging times. They should not rest on their success for too long nor dwell on their failures because neither approach is helpful. Entrepreneurs who want to quit at the first sign of challenges will have difficulty living up to their full potential. I also like to tell young entrepreneurs to believe in themselves and their chosen path. They need to keep moving forward no matter what, even if everyone else around them tells them that reaching their goals is impossible. If I had listened to the negativity flowing toward me when I first started LifeWave, I would have stopped before I started.  I also suggest employees at any company, including mine, should always take the time to hone their skills around the fundamentals. No one should assume they have mastered the basics of any business and they should never stop trying to improve themselves.   "," We have used an independent distributor business model from the start, and that has worked out well for us. I could share dozens of success stories of people from all walks of life who held a wide variety of jobs before becoming independent distributors for LifeWave. Some have made it a part-time job within the gig economy, while others have achieved tremendous success making LifeWave their only business. Marketing has always come easily for our company because we release cutting-edge health products like no other.  Our first product launch was Energy Enhancer in 2004, which earned the company $17 million in gross revenue during the first year of its release. Sales exceeded our expectations and gave us the confidence that people are indeed looking for alternatives to improve their health. We advertised Energy Enhancer mostly by word-of-mouth. After we launched Energy Enhancer, we went on to introduce several patch products that addressed pain, sleep, stress, and anti-aging. Ice Wave as our pain product has been a consistent success and Aeon, which promotes relaxation and reduced stress, has always been a top seller.   I went on stage with the actress Suzanne Somers, one of our Ambassadors who worked with us for 10 years, to launch Aeon. A recording technician from our company captured the initial launch celebration and sent it to our team of independent distributors around the world, who used it to promote Aeon in their local markets. In January of 2019, we released our most successful patch ever, X39. This innovative, patented product elevates a copper peptide, known through previously published studies to activate stem cells. We spent 10 years developing X39 and the minute we launched it, it was an instant hit among distributors worldwide, driving our sales to record levels for the year. The word of mouth on X39 performance was and continues to be breath-taking and perfect validation for the value of using the independent distributor business model. ‍"," The first place I recommend people go to learn more about LifeWave is our business website. Our content is available in multiple languages, and website visitors can change the default to the language of their own country. We produced a four-minute video about LifeWave located under the About section that also gives a lot of background information. People can learn about our products and find a distributor from our main website as well. Here are the links to the social media sites we are active in that anyone is welcome to follow:  ‍Facebook‍Instagram‍YouTube I also encourage anyone who is considering purchasing our products for the first time to read what other customers have to say about them on our review page."," I do not know how I would be able to have productive days without the ability to meet virtually with key people within my company at all hours of the day.  As a global company doing business in all time zones, Zoom and Skype have been indispensable…pandemic or not.    As for favorite books, I think Power vs. Force by David Hawkins is the best book I have ever read. I highly recommend it to all entrepreneurs because it will give them a perspective on life they may never have considered. I also spend time reflecting on my favorite quote each day. Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “What lies behind you, and what lies before you, pales to insignificance as compared to what lies within you.”  This is a great quote.  Where people come from ultimately does not matter if they have the conviction and resilience to pursue their dreams, no matter what the obstacles or costs. And when you humbly seek God regularly for wisdom, support, and answers, the peace of mind and energy that flows through you and within you can add a confident self-assurance that underpins all that you set out to do each day. ‍",,Health,,United States,"August 24, 2021",David Schmidt,https://www.failory.com/interview/lifewave,"['https://lifewave.com/corporphan/home/company', 'https://www.facebook.com/LifeWaveHealth/', 'https://www.instagram.com/LifeWaveHealth/', 'https://www.youtube.com/c/LifeWaveHealth', 'https://lifewave.com/corporphan/home/reviews']",success,1,+$500k/mo,"David launched LifeWave, a fast-growing health technology company, in 2002.

132,linkody," Hey, I’m François Mommens, founder of Linkody. I live in Amsterdam, but I’m planning to go back to France or Spain in the near future. When I don’t work, I climb, hike, cycle, or ice skate and I love being in nature. My first job was to work as a backend developer for Echo Interactive, a startup that was bought out by France Telecom. I was part of a small team that developed one of the first search engines (a long time ago, even before Google). This was a great adventure. After that, I worked for several companies in various countries but I got slowly disillusioned and realised I wanted to be in control and have my own business. Linkody is the tool you need if you want to take full control of your backlinks. Everything is there to help you understand your link profile, track your existing links, and get new ones. It’s used by SEO agencies to manage their clients’ link building campaigns and by SMB for their own SEO needs. Right now the business generates about $140,000 ARR with several hundred customers and growing slowly. ‍",," The main issue I’ve been facing is how competitive the SEO industry is. New tools are coming to the market every day. Not only that, but I’m obviously also competing against the best SEOs for organic traffic. Depending only on Google for traffic is already risky in itself. Recently I got hit and lost a big chunk of it. I ran some SEO analysis and I finally identified the reason, thanks actually to my own tool Linkody. I lost 2 very powerful links, one from Fox News, and another from a big national portal. This happened just before the hit. The causality cannot be proven, but I would bet on it (you cannot be sure of anything with Google, don’t trust people who say otherwise). And so I’m back on building new links to compensate for the loss (actually paying someone to do it). ‍",," Today the tool is very mature and comprehensive in its own niche. All the backlink acquisition/tracking SEO tasks are covered. If I want to grow faster, I would have to get outside the backlink niche and turn the tool into a full fledged SEO tool, something I don’t really want to do because the competition is just too fierce. So I’m working on something different and innovative, although for the same industry. Very few companies are offering the service I’m working on and I think they are not doing a very good job, probably because the technical challenge is quite difficult to properly solve. Oh, just before starting on that I released a side project, JobboarPlugin, just to learn a few technologies really, but it might have some potential. When it comes to personal goals I want to go back to France or Spain, buy some land in the countryside, grow a food forest and have some animals. There’s also this crazy idea to create a yoga/meditation/rock climbing retreat (my girlfriend is a yoga and meditation teacher and, as already said, I’m a rock climber). But I don’t see how I could do that while working on two (three?) different online businesses. Unless I sell them. ‍",," The first version was released in about 3 weeks. For this version I received some help from a friend for the design (he’s the founder of Lovehabibi, a great success story). At the time I was a backend Perl and Java developer. I however chose to learn PHP and Symfony because that seemed more suited for rapid web development. I had only 3 weeks to spend because I was between jobs. After releasing the tool and starting my new full time job I didn’t touch it, until one day it got a couple of good reviews and started to get some traction (although it really was the MVP you can see in the screenshot below).  So I decided to invest some time to release a better version, with paid plans, to see if I could sell it. I used my free time, week-ends, evenings, holidays. When I sold my first subscriptions, I considered the opportunity good enough to quit my job and start working full time on the business. Fortunately I had enough savings to last until I could make a living out of it. From there I kept improving the product following the lean startup approach, using a mix of user feedback, looking at what the big players offered, and testing ideas. One thing I always tried to achieve is to keep the interface coherent, consistent, and simple. The tool got a lot of praise for that. And providing outstanding support.",," Before Linkody, I launched a previous startup with a friend of mine. However, this wasn’t a success and we soon gave up (this could be a story in the failed section ). I did learn my first lesson then. Don’t start a business with your friends just because they are your friends. By working on that first business, I eventually got the idea for Linkody. Back in the days, the only thing I knew about SEO was the importance of backlinks. I was doing link exchanges and needed a tool to check that my partners didn’t remove them. A lot of the existing tools were providing general reports about new and lost links, but none was offering to manually add links and check them on a daily basis. I thought it was worth investing some time in this idea so I decided to develop a minimal viable product. ‍"," Being a solopreneur is hard! It feels like I’m doing the work of 5 different people. The product design, the UX, the frontend/backend dev, the promotion… If you use the chat widget to ask for support, I’ll be the one to answer ) Relying on oneself for every single decision is also difficult. I have a couple of entrepreneur friends I could turn to for advice, and there are always the online communities, but it’s not like having partners. There’s a good reason why VCs and business angels don’t invest in solopreneurs, but only in teams with a broad set of complementary skills (something I also learned the hard way). Anyway, I focus on the exciting part, that I’m 100% in control. It’s liberating to accept the full responsibility of my decisions. Another thing I learned is how difficult it is to get feedback. The whole lean startup method advocated absolutely everywhere is relying on this essential thing, getting feedback from your customers. What is not specified is how difficult it is. Nobody has time to give feedback. When was the last time you gave feedback for any of the 10 tools you’re using on a daily basis? Right."," When it comes to marketing and promotion I had to learn everything. One thing I realised quickly was that SEM wouldn’t be an option in such a competitive industry, and with so few money keywords. Instead I focused on SEO, link building, and content marketing via the blog. Although I’m self-thought on many topics, writing is definitely not my forte. So I hired someone to write content on a regular basis. The blog got traction and the traffic rose steadily. However, the conversion was very disappointing. It was basically costing me money for nothing and I had to stop. The good thing with a blog is when it gets enough authority, you start receiving enough guest post offers to keep posting content on a regular basis. It costs time though. I receive tons of offers, or spam, and ultimately reject 90% of posts. I keep investing this time in the blog because even if it does not generate customers, it is still useful for acquiring backlinks and for giving authority to the money site. The other strategy was to offer free SEO tools. I started with a Backlink Checker giving limited results for free. This worked pretty well. So well actually that every single SEO tool is now offering an equivalent. I had to diversify and develop more free tools like the Google Index Checker. It’s hard to measure but word of mouth also has an impact, some customers said the tool was recommended to them. Finally, I have a few brand advocates that regularly mention the tool or recommend it directly to their partners. ‍"," Checkout Linkody for link monitoring, and LinkStorm for internal link opportunities read the blog to learn everything about marketing and traffic acquisition connect with me on Linkedin.

133,liveagent," Ahoy! I'm David Cacik and I'm the Head of Growth at LiveAgent. I started my first company in high school and then another one in college. I failed the first one and sold the second one and later took an exciting role at LiveAgent. I was the first growth guru to join the company, and helped it grow from $20k to $250k MRR.  LiveAgent helps improve interactions between customers and companies. We are a bootstrapped SaaS, based out of Bratislava, Slovakia (Central Europe). Our competitors are venture funded companies like Zendesk and Freshdesk which makes my job super challenging and attractive. ‍",," When we started actively promoting LiveAgent, we quickly realized the big players like Zendesk and Freshdesk dominated the market. We were struggling with positioning ourselves and setting the right USP to stand out. Also, we are a bootstrapped company and we had to compete with companies with more than 300M+ in funding, which didn’t make acquiring customer easy.  Another struggle was finding the right talent. We’ve always had a hard time to find good sales reps and developers.  Recently, we also encountered quite a few problems with our datacenter provider which caused downtimes and we had to restructure our infrastructure completely. Thousands of companies rely on LiveAgent when supporting their end users, including fintech and telco companies, where even seconds matter. We had to invest a lot and act quickly because the consequences could have been fatal. Last but not least, new competitors are popping up like a mushroom, offering free plans with no viable business model. With that comes a higher demand for better functionality, improved UI and customer experience. It’s a constant game which is changing and maybe that’s what intrigues me about my work the most, it wouldn’t be so much fun it was that easy, right?  We should’ve optimized our onboarding process earlier, instead, we focused on adding more features. When we introduced a new getting started guide (which didn’t take much time to implement), we immediately saw a spike in conversions. We definitely should’ve done this earlier. We hired an agency to help us with our marketing initiatives and failed. They didn’t know the product well enough, they’ve focused on redesigning our pricing plans and website instead of finding new leads which cost us money and work time of our internal team. We also hired an external team which didn’t work out as well. They knew even less about the product and did not close a single deal. From that moment, we decided to minimize our outsourcing efforts and focused on hiring internally instead. ‍",,," I think that my biggest disadvantage is that I want to know about everything that’s happening, what our customers are saying, what’s the quality of their interaction with our team, how is our marketing performing on a daily basis and sometimes I get lost in all the information and lack the general image. At LiveAgent, we try to be disruptive and push out new features very often which sometimes brings complications like bugs or functionality not working 100%. On the other hand, no software is perfect and if somebody says, their software is bug-free, they are lying. Recently, we hired a new software tester so I’m confident this move will help us to deliver more stable releases. ‍"," LiveAgent was built as a spin-off project. Our first product was Post Affiliate Pro, an affiliate management platform, which popularity was growing rapidly. We were in the market for a new customer service solution when we realized none of the tools were sufficient. That’s when we started to build LiveAgent. It took 3 years for it to become a multichannel help desk software, like it is today but is still improved daily by new updates pushed by our devs. We didn’t plan on selling LiveAgent in the early days, we only wanted to use it internally. Some of our customers, mainly B2Bs, were asking us about the support tool we used. That’s how we sold the first license.  Today, LiveAgent makes up 75% of the company’s MRR, overcoming Post Affiliate Pro in both revenue and number of customers. Both PAP and LiveAgent are built with similar technologies, utilizing PHP & Java as the main programming languages and using MySQL, Kibana, Elastic and also Grafana for performance monitoring. Our servers run in multiple locations (EU, US, Asia) with multiple providers starting with Linode where most of our accounts run on the fast SSD nodes, AWS where the bigger files are stored. Recently, we started building our own “in-house” server farm in EU to ensure the highest performance possible and increase uptime. We will be migrating our EU customers there soon.",," When I was 15, me and 2 of my high school buddies started a game hosting company. We were kids and we were selling virtual server space for games like Counter Strike or World of Warcraft to other kids. We failed and discontinued the project when we all went our separate ways to different universities. During my studies, I started a new eCommerce project, an online pharmacy with automated delivery of commonly used products like toothbrush, razors, toilet paper etc. Even though I made it to the final of the Student Entrepreneur Awards, I decided to sell the project and move on.  I joined LiveAgent in 2013, and I was employee #10, the 1st and only marketing guy. I was 21 years old, not knowing what I was getting into but I experimented a lot and over the course of 4 years, I’ve helped the company grow from $20k to $250k in Monthly Recurring Revenue. ‍",," The initial traction was achieved by upselling former customers. It wasn’t sufficient enough though. In order to be ROI positive, we needed more customers and better growth.  We started experimenting with PPC, content marketing, improving onboarding experience, SEO outbound sales and many more. At first, we didn’t have much success but we were still growing continuously. We’ve tried Google AdWords, Bing Ads, Facebook, Twitter and all kinds of other minor PPC networks. The fact that the average customer value was lower than most of our competitors’ and also that they were literally burning investors’ money with PPCs made it especially hard to compete in the Pay Per Click space. We had to find long tail keywords, and competitor keywords which worked out pretty well (be careful to obey Google’s rules). Generic terms like “customer service software” were super expensive and we’ve burned a lot of cash trying to compete the big players. I would not recommend going down this way for other startups. Eventually, we figured out the keywords that were performing well and we’ve been bidding on them until today. Do content, they said. So we did - we pushed out valuable, fact-based, well-formatted blog posts supported by infographics and images. 99% of the blog posts didn’t get much traction. In fact, there are only 2-3 articles that rank well on relevant keywords. Doing content right is hard and we have yet to figure it out. On the other hand, one of the growth strategies, that helped boost growth particularly well, was including LiveAgent in software directories and boosting our presence there. Ever since the beginning, we’ve been a customer-centric company so we had a pretty solid base of satisfied customers. After listing LiveAgent on websites like G2Crowd, Capterra, GetApp or FinancesOnline, we’ve reached out to our audience and invited them to leave a review, good or bad, on one of these websites. We even incentivized their efforts by providing $20 Amazon coupons to everyone who shares their experience. We received hundreds of positive reviews which helped us rank high in comparisons and gained a lot of traffic.  ‍"," On LiveAgent’s blog, we post lessons on growth, marketing and customer service in B2B so make sure to check it out. Recently, I started blogging about SaaS Growth Hacking on my personal blog.

134,localtown," I'm a product manager by day and a no-code maker by night. A few years ago, I launched LocalTown using no-code tools and learned a tremendous amount from it. And since then, I've been working to make it easier for makers to build and launch with no-code tools.  I'm the maker of Side Project Stack, and currently working on an online book called the Lean Side Project,which is still in pre-order. When you first start launching a startup we hear all the time about doing things that don't scale...however how do you actually do that? I have written about how to do it and laid out a framework based on successful founders. ‍"," Once I had launched it, I didn't stay as focused on it. I started to expand too quickly on other problems I wanted to solve around, just recommending no-code tools. It was taking me a long time. I'd gotten all this good feedback, but I wasn't growing as quickly as I thought that I should have. I spent 5 months working on other things when I should have gone deeper on the initial product. Once I started going deeper it started exploding. It's starting to grow on its own, where I don't have to push it and people are trying the tool so I wish I would have done that earlier."," Getting quality feedback was the main challenge when first starting. How do I validate my ideas? The only way I could get that was by talking with people. It's hard because you need to establish a relationship and give value to them before selling anything, because otherwise, they're not going to spend time with you. I gave feedback through Twitter if they launched something and offered to be a beta tester. You'd be surprised if you take that approach. They're going to reciprocate when you need help. ‍",,,," I launched it in 2016. It was an online marketplace built with Sharetribe. What I quickly learned was that using no-code tools was by far the easiest part of launching an online business. I did so many things wrong when launching it. The only thing I did do right was to choose Sharetribe. Sharetribe allowed me to launch with no worries about payments, authentication, admin controls, or giving different permissions for the supply side of the marketplace to access the application. Getting custom features was possible, but it was too much for what I wanted to build. Sharetribe was able to get me 80% of the product I wanted. I spent a year making this product without getting validation, without setting up an audience, and without doing all the steps necessary before launch. Justin Kahn, founder of Twitch, said that “first time makers focus on the product. Second-time makers focus on the distribution.” When I launched LocalTown, I earned some revenue and got press coverage in local news, but I wasn't able to sustain it. I started learning from other makers to understand why I couldn’t make it work. I was just seeing on Twitter a few makers building with no-code and I started documenting that. Then I created a tool called GetStackd, which became Product of the Day on Product Hunt. It was a form that helped makers figure out what tools to use. I created a database and then I created a simple logic using Typeform and Airtable. It mapped together your idea, your skill level, and the complexity of what you wanted to build. Then it scored the answers and mapped it to the tools that makers used for real projects. It was based on real data. Then used Zapier and Gmail to sent an automated recommendation. The feedback I got was tremendous. I've noticed that a lot of people need help with launching. And so that's what my next project is, which I'm also building with no-code tools."," Launching should not be a single event or one big event. It should be many small events that lead up to an even bigger launch. My audience was on Twitter and on Product Hunt. But in between I wanted to know if it scratched my own itch. I DM’ed some folks who had been engaging with me on Twitter around no-code. I showed them my project and asked for feedback and what it meant for them. Once you get that feedback, you can tweak the copy, make things simpler, or reduce the scope of the MVP. After that, I just tweeted about it asking for more feedback. When I did that, it was the biggest tweet I ever had at the time, with 30 likes and a bunch of retweets. After I got some users, I reached out to all of them to ask for more feedback and I kept iterating from there. ‍"," It was my first take on entrepreneurship. I was so excited to jump in and start building it that I didn’t validate if the market needed it. Just wanted to scratch my own itch.  My main problem was, as I discovered, I was spending 50% of my time trying to figure out what tools to use to make something. It’s exciting we can create working web applications and marketplaces without writing code. I just wanted to make that process easier so people can spend less time trying to figure out what tool to use, and more time talking with users and customers to make something they love and need. ‍"," Every day I tweet about a new project that's added to the site, and I do a tear down about what did I learn. The engagement I've got around that has been huge and I wish I would have done that a lot earlier. I didn't grow the top of my funnel, which is my audience, enough in the beginning. People are now discovering me through Twitter. I also wish I would have focused more on what was working. I tried to optimize my website for SEO and I spent a lot of energy. I'm still waiting to get a return on that. I focused too quickly on trying to do a user acquisition strategy instead of just continue to focus on audience building. Staying focused is hard because your time is so limited. I thought that I could do everything at the same time. But I learned to focus more on what was working and then keep fueling that insted of shifting my focus. My biggest takeaway is that even though you have an idea, it's more important to try to find an audience first before you build a product. Instead of selling a product, you should engage with people that have that problem and grow empathy for those problems. These people could become your first users. I failed at that.  It's so easy to fall in that trap because you're so excited to jump in and start building. It's so much easier to show a working product than tell somebody your idea. It's okay to build an MVP. If it's going to take you 100 hours to build, that would be a big red flag for me. With this MVP, potential users can give you feedback and understand if it solves this problem or not. I found that when you create something, no matter how small, the universe responds. Your first users aren't going to expect a polished product. We spent so much time trying to polish a product and trying to get it perfect before we launch it. But if we think about our launches in several micro launches, then you don't need a perfect product in your first launch. On your second launch, which should be to a private beta group, they will still understand if is just a concept.   I've talked to over 100 makers starting a side-project and I've also interviewed dozens. Everything comes down to time and momentum. We're using tactics for startups, and we're trying to apply that to side projects. But those tactics don't work for a side project. You're just trying to test something out. People are getting a lot of false negatives. They ship something and they don't get any feedback or engagement and think their idea sucks. If you have a passion for it because it's going to solve a problem for you, then you know that it's going to be worth your time and you'll be motivated to work on it, and you'll gain momentum to actually ship it. If you don't have an itch to scratch, and you're looking to find a problem in another niche, you need an accountability mechanism. Do you have another person you're checking in to share progress? Are you tweeting about your progress and updates? Do you have a community that can keep you accountable? 100 days of no-code challenge by Max Haining is a great example. I’m in that community and it keeps me accountable. Only when you ship it, you can add it to your resume and to your portfolio.  For my book, I've been waiting to launch the pre-order page because it has taken me a little bit more time to make it. So I first launched a signup page because this gives me a chance to make another announcement to to get momentum. ‍",, You can find me on Twitter and subscribe to my newsletter.," Hooked by Nir Eyal was so pivotal for me because I could understand a product is an experience. You'll want to have your user experience that product. Again and again. I also learned a lot from The Lean Startup by Eric Ries and Zero to One by Peter Thiel. No-code enables you to make anything, but you can get into a trap where it's too easy to create stuff without taking the steps to validate it.  Also, Twitter is a huge resource for me. The hard part about it is finding the right people to follow.

135,locationrebel," My name is Sean Ogle and I’m the founder of Location Rebel, which I started in May of 2009. I’m 36 years old and based in Portland, Oregon. The purpose of Location Rebel is to help people build small businesses that give them more time, freedom, and money to enjoy the things that make them happiest in life. ",," Honestly, my biggest mistake is not choosing one thing and sticking with it. If my sole goal were to grow the business, have as much impact, and make as much money as possible, it would have been much easier to just do one thing. Managing 3 limits the opportunities for each, if I’m committed to not bringing on a team. As soon as I focus on one thing I’m dropping the ball on something else. I don’t know that I regret going this route as the opportunities each has afforded, and the lifestyle benefits I alluded to above, have made it worthwhile.  But I spend a lot of time thinking about what it would look like if I were to go all-in on just one thing and if it would be worth it. The biggest mistake we ever made in the business was a technical one. We moved the entire site over to a service called Rainmaker in 2016. It was a disaster. The member experience suffered, the company didn't deliver on any of their promises, and a month after switching traffic dropped 30%. We spent thousands to design the new site and move it over, and thousands more to move it back to WordPress two years later. The lesson here is to make sure if you’re going to trust your whole business to a technical platform that you verify it’s delivering on what they say it will. ",," Today, things are great. I’ve always been someone who needs multiple things going. I get bored easily, so having a handful of different businesses and brands, while maybe not the most effective for growth, has allowed me to stay engaged for over a decade. So Location Rebel is doing great, and our big change this year is moving over to an all-new platform for our membership community and redesigning the site for the first time in 6 years. But a lot of my attention is going to Breaking Eighty my golf site, and Slightly Pretentious my cocktail site. I tend to build things around a quest. For Location Rebel it was my bucket list. Breaking Eighty it’s a goal to play the top 100 golf courses in the world (51/100). Slightly Pretentious it’s to visit the top 100 bars in the world (59/100). Location Rebel continues to do six figures a year, as does the golf business. The cocktail one is new, but already starting to earn affiliate revenue. My goal is to build things that don’t just make money, but that enhance the enjoyment I get out of my hobbies - while hopefully helping people in the process. Right now the only other person working with me is my community manager Liz at Location Rebel (although that term doesn’t do her justice to the amount of stuff she does for the brand). I’ll occasionally hire writers or developers if I need them, but I like not having to manage anyone but myself. The challenge lies when you’ve built 3 things that all deserve full-time attention, but that doesn’t always get it. Revenue continues to grow across all 3 sites, so the goal now is to manage them while continuing to maintain the lifestyle aspect that got me into this in the first place.",," By October of 2009, I’d left my job, and in January of 2010, I moved to Thailand where I began doing freelance SEO and freelance writing. What I realized later on is that this freelance work was the bridge from a life that left me unfulfilled and unhappy, to one that allowed me to do whatever I wanted to do. This also formed the basis for Location Rebel Academy. I believe the easiest way to get out of a day job, and build a sustainable long term lifestyle business is to follow a 3 step process: Build a website to use as your training ground for learning valuable skills like copywriting, SEO, the basics of design, and marketing.Freelance one of those skills (typically writing) you excel at to build your income, confidence, and momentum. Once you’re at $3k a month you’ve got options.Take everything you’ve learned and apply it to something you’re passionate about and build a brand around that. This video talks about that three-step process and is also my favorite thing I’ve ever made: Location Rebel the blog served as my training ground.Freelance writing helped me pay the bills while I learned how to work online. It then gave me the time to build the things I was excited about in Location Rebel Academy and my golf site Breaking Eighty. This sets the stage for Location Rebel Academy, our product. By July of 2011 I’d realized that I had learned a lot, and this process that I’d gone through worked for me, so maybe it would work for others as well. I spent 3 months creating a course that taught you essential online skills, but more importantly, taught you how to make money with them through freelancing. I spent 3 months promoting the launch. I released a PDF book of all the tools I used to work from anywhere, and then released 4 videos covering some of the main tenets of the business. This included things like the reality of job security and rapid skill-building. I did a “beta” launch of 20 spots for $297. We’d built up an email list of around 600 people, and I simply hoped I’d sell all 20 spots within a week. Being my first real launch, I didn’t know what to expect. We launched at 9 am on July 26th, and within 48 minutes we’d sold out all 20 spots. I couldn’t shut the sales page down fast enough and we sold 4 more. So in less than an hour, I made $7,000 - and that’s when I began to believe in the potential of what I was building. But it wasn’t all easy from there on out. Riding off the success of our beta launch, two months later I planned the “real” launch.  One of the mistakes I made early on, was thinking that I had to be traveling all over the world and proving you could “work from anywhere” to get people to join. So for the main launch, I moved to Bali for two months. I had huge expectations riding off our previous success. I got everything prepared, I stayed up late Bali time to do the launch, and when it went live?  Crickets. No more than a handful of sales. People didn’t need or necessarily want to see me in an exotic location. Most people following Location Rebel just wanted to be able to work from home from their sweats. Or have the ability to take their kids to the park in the middle of a Tuesday. It took me a while to learn that lesson, but once I did, it took some of the pressure off the travel aspect of the site. Since that launch 10 years ago, we’ve now had over 4,000 people go through the course. We’ve had hundreds of people quit their jobs and build successful online businesses.",," I had a very typical middle-class upbringing, which prepared me to always follow the path of least resistance. By the 6th grade, I knew I’d be going to Oregon State University and studying business. 6 months before graduating, I had a job lined up as a portfolio analyst for a small investment firm. It was always just taking the easy road. Two things happened that changed that. 1) I started my desk job and realized it wasn’t anything like I imagined it being. The novelty of wearing a suit only lasts for so long.  2) I started in July of 2007 - which was at the peak of the stock market. By February 2009, the market had crashed. My boss was unhappy, our clients were unhappy, and I was unhappy. I needed a restart. I saved up all of my vacation time for the year to go to Carnival with my best friend Ryan in Rio. We spent two weeks hang-gliding over Rio, dancing in the Carnival parade, and even visiting Iguazu Falls, one of the seven natural wonders of the world. On the last day, we were sitting on Ipanema Beach, thinking “we should be able to do this whenever we want.” The day I got back I received a 20% pay cut. That was when I knew a change needed to come, and within two months I’d launched Location Rebel simply as a vehicle for change for myself, and to hold myself publicly accountable for all the things I wanted to do in life. I had two goals when I graduated college: Travel and own my own business. I wasn’t getting closer to any of those in my job, and this was the tipping point that encouraged me to pursue both. The first thing I did on the site was publish my bucket list. 100 things I wanted to do before I died. I started checking them off, and people started paying attention. I think the brutal honesty of where I was at in life, coupled with an attitude of “if Sean can make a big change, maybe I can too” is what initially helped to get some traction. "," A few things: The worst-case scenario rarely happens, and when it does, it likely isn’t as bad as you think it’s going to be. The process of starting a business is not difficult. The work isn’t hard. What’s hard is being persistent enough to keep working amidst the ups and the downs. I know very few people who have spent at least an hour a day working on a lifestyle business for two years that haven’t had a certain amount of success. Starting a blog is the most valuable thing you can do if you’re not sure what the first step is. Blogs aren’t dead. As social media algorithms continue to shift, owning your website and email list has continued to just get more and more valuable. "," Over the years since launching the course, we’ve tried several different marketing strategies. But honestly, the thing that has worked the best is putting time and effort into creating content that ranks organically. We focused primarily on a hub and spoke content strategy, where we have one definitive post for our primary keyword, and related “spoke” posts to cover related keywords in more depth. Then we have anywhere from 6-15 “spoke” posts, that all link back to that post, and to each other that go into depth on specific topics mentioned within the hub post. Doing this has led to a lot of natural links, but we’ll also do guest posts around the most valuable topics. We’ve done this for about a dozen different topics on the site, and it’s worked well over the years. Lately, YouTube has also been helping to grow the business and we’ve found that the nature of video has led to higher quality and more engaged followers. That’s the traffic part. As far as conversions go, we decided a few years ago to keep it simple. One funnel and one primary offer. Rather than offering all of our courses ala carte, we wanted to focus on just selling the Academy as a whole. So we tweaked and tested our email series until we had one that converted well, and while we’ve updated it over the years - it’s still fundamentally the same one we’ve been using since it was first created. It’s useful for people that want help and provides the opportunity to get additional handholding for the people that want it. Content marketing with organic traffic is not the sexy thing, and it takes longer than other marketing methods. But we’ve found it to be more sustainable and less fleeting once you do get it right.

136,lockpick-entertainment," Hi there, I have sort of a strange and varied background. I started off studying video game design at college and messed around with everything from animation to cognitive science. But my game development career didn’t really go as planned. I joined Lockpick Entertainment in my sophomore year and stayed with them a year after graduating. It was not to last, however. After college, I instead ended up working on the design of software tools because I kept getting bogged down in poorly designed fundamentals. Back in those days, game development tools were woefully underdeveloped, and when I switched over to the Web industry I realized the same was true for all software tools.  Currently, I’m working on BlankPage, a motivational service that helps writers finish their first drafts, and Kod.app which is a full Javascript IDE for the iPad Pro. ‍"," Lockpick failed because of several reasons that came together. The bottom of the market for MMO products fell out. The iPhone was released and mobile gaming took over the hype. But the real issue was that our product simply wasn’t mature enough. It was interesting, but not sticky. If it had been a normal product, I’d say we hadn’t reached product fit yet. For an entertainment product, this means it just wasn’t done. We sort of knew this at launch, but we were running out of money fast and we were hoping that we could sustain a development pace post-launch that would improve the product enough to make our users stay. But we badly underestimated just how hard it is to sustain a pace of delivery for entertainment. None of us had ever worked with that. We gave it an incredible run though, the product didn’t really fail until years after that launch. We just scaled the product down, refocused, and relaunched a couple of times. Slowly losing our core group of fans over the period. I stayed with the company for about a year after launch, but some of the founders and new members kept it going another 3 years after that (if I remember correctly). We never changed the trajectory of growth, however. So the original launch was our high point. When the product finally wound down I felt mostly relieved. But also very spurred on to make it work. Since I had distanced myself a bit from the process I was charged up and ready to go again. I’m glad I didn’t however. The product was doomed due to choices made years before. There just wasn’t ever going to escape velocity enough for the team to fix those issues. ‍"," For me personally, it was misunderstanding the scope of everything I worked on. How to plan out something as massive and complex as thousands of people interacting is a hard problem to solve. But it’s infinitely more difficult if you don’t acknowledge that up front. I just started at one end and tried to work myself through it. Besides my personal failing with scope. I think the team never understood quite what we were building. The game to start with was a competitive strategy game, where each league lasted about three months. But we spent zero time designing a pipeline for content and league cycles. We only focused on the core product, which is very similar to feature creep. Because we never saw the entire lifespan of the product use we didn’t really create a process where we could deliver such a product. We only really achieved an embyotic state of such a product. To be fair though, the technical and development burden for that state is something like 80% of the entire product. So it wasn’t a case of prioritising completely wrong, we just missed out on a very important part of what we should’ve been building. ‍",,,,," This was back in 2006, and since the launch of World of Warcraft in 04 the market was completely insane around anything MMO. We had some fantastic artists on the team so the minute we set up a registration page and posted some art people started streaming in. Most didn’t convert though, but at the launch of the game, thousands became customers."," Lockpick Entertainment was the first startup I ever worked with. It was a small game studio started by students at my school. Basically, some students figured out that the best way to get some experience was to start their own company. They did, and I joined them a year after that. We created a hybrid MMO RTS game called Dreamlords where thousands of players would play against each other and a rapidly collapsing world to level up their avatars in iterations of the apocalypse. Eventually to break the cycle (never happened though). ‍"," At one point the design team sat down after realizing the game wasn’t much fun. Instead of doubling down on iterating the mechanics of the game to make it fun. We vastly expanded the scope. We could have made a much better game if we’d just accepted that most games aren’t fun until you iterate the hell out of them.  Don’t be afraid to think things through. It’s rarely a failure to take a step back, it’s actually what makes most projects really good in the end. ‍",," You can follow everything I do on my website or, if you still use Twitter, you can find me at @jesperbylund."," I don't think it matters much which sources you have, as long as you read and study a lot about creating things. Whether building companies, art, products, games or even things, the process is similar. And no two experiences are the same. I love the startup culture which we are currently in because it focuses on clarity about the process for small companies, so I’d recommend reading the entire YC library. Listening to podcasts about startups. Definitely read Peter Thiel’s amazing book “From Zero to One”. But overall, inundate yourself with these stories of creation. Because they’re all different, but focus on the same critical issue: creating something from nothing. Moreover, check out the latest things written by Basecamp, and listen to the Masters of Scale podcast by Reid Hoffman. It’s fantastic.  ‍"," I only invested time into the project. But I financed that time with student loans, which are quite a good deal in Sweden. So, I put maybe a year or so of student loans and 2 years of work into the project.  The company did achieve quite a lot of income (talking about millions), but it started strong and just teetered off. So, we never had any revenue but reinvested every cent into working on the product. In the end, the product lived for something like 6 years before finally being put to rest.  ",Software & Hardware,Competition,Sweden,"March 17, 2018",Jesper Bylund,https://www.failory.com/interview/lockpick-entertainment,"['http://jesperbylund.com/', 'https://twitter.com/@jesperbylund']",failure,0,,"Lockpick Entertainment was a small game studio, that created Dreamlords, a famous MMORTS game.

137,lunch-money," Hi! I’m the founder, engineer, designer, customer support, and all-in-all one-woman team at Lunch Money, a subscription-based personal finance & budgeting web app. I started learning basic web programming (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript) at the tender age of 13 after my older sister suggested that I try my hand at making websites instead of wasting my time playing online games (Neopets!). I was instantly hooked and I remember spending my mornings, evenings, and entire summers in front of the computer with Paint Shop Pro and Notepad crafting all sorts of different websites. My love for computers only grew fonder over the years. Eventually, I attended the University of Waterloo in Canada and I graduated with a degree in computer engineering. I’m based in Toronto as a digital snowmad, meaning I aim to spend the harsh Canadian winters abroad in Asia. Last year, my husband and I spent 4 months in Fukuoka, Japan, where the first iteration of Lunch Money was built. This year, my husband and I are in Taipei, Taiwan. ‍  I spent the first 4.5 years of my career in Silicon Valley where I worked as a software engineer at Twitter for almost 4 years, experiencing both its startup heydeys and post-IPO growing pains. Eventually, I quit and co-founded a start-up with my roommate in the pet health space. We worked on the company together for a year, during which we went through the first batch of YC Fellowship and 500 Startups (both are seed accelerators). Shortly into 500 Startups, I came into a general realization that this wasn’t where I wanted to be, especially not as a 26-year-old with so many aspirations beyond the Silicon Valley dream. They say the average age of a start-up is 7 years before it dies or gets acquired, and it spooked me to think the rest of my 20s could be spent chasing this singular dream and “maybe” or “maybe not” succeeding. Eventually, I made the difficult decision of leaving the start-up. My co-founder was more than capable of running the company on her own and we parted ways on good terms. Burn-out is a very real feeling and can catalyze some pretty crazy changes. I ended up diving really deep into minimalism, no longer wanting to bear the responsibility of anything aside from the minimum necessities. I gave away or sold almost all my stuff. I said goodbye to my friends and the city I called home for the last 5 years with no regrets and I was ready to finally start living life on my own schedule. After spending 2 months at home reconnecting with my parents with a newly-refreshed mind, I ended up on an 8-month adventure abroad where I deliberately sought out experiences that would take me far away from anything computer or tech-related. Here’s a sample of what I ended up doing: I stayed at a farm in rural northeastern Thailand where I helped herd sheep at sunrise,I went through a medical emergency in Thailand and experienced first-class medical care,I was the first tourist in a small Thai village known for its monkey forest and went Thai-style camping nearbyI lived with a family in the middle of the mountains and experienced rural French culture,I worked as a bartender/waitress at a restaurant in rural Burgundy in exchange for lodging I also did some good ol’ fashioned traveling through amazing cities such as Lyon, Tallin, Stockholm, and Copenhagen. At the end of it all, my parents met me in France and I wrapped up my sabbatical by showing them around my new favorite country for 2.5 weeks. I flew back to Toronto and started the next phase of my life in the city I grew up in and was joined by my now-husband who was also on his own sabbatical during this time. We spent the first few months back in Toronto enjoying each other’s company and re-discovering Toronto as residents. By this point, I hadn’t done any programming in almost 1.5 years and as is expected in the world of software development, a lot had changed.  For the next two months, I went to a coffee shop every day to catch up. I decided to learn React and I eventually released a fully-functioning app to the App Store– a Chinese phrasebook app inspired by my own travels. It has almost no downloads aside from my mom. While I didn’t gain any riches from this app, I did gain the skills necessary to pick up some freelancing jobs. Through my network, I worked as a freelance software engineer for three different companies over the span of the next 2 years, each having different roles and responsibilities ranging from web development to full-stack engineering.  My husband and I were having a great time in Toronto but we realized we didn’t love it so much during the winter. We were both fully remote in our jobs, so why not take the opportunity to scratch our itch to travel and go abroad during that time?  In 2019, we kicked off our “digital snowmad” lifestyle by spending a winter abroad in Fukuoka, Japan. During my time there, I was able to work on a few personal goals (learn Japanese cuisine, learn elementary Japanese). I was also continuing to freelance for 2 different companies while starting to work on what is today known as Lunch Money!",," The biggest challenges in working on Lunch Money has always been time management and prioritization. When I first started working on Lunch Money, I was splitting my time with 2 other freelancing commitments while living in a country that I was yearning to discover. I wanted to do everything! I knew I needed to make money but I couldn’t stop my brain from thinking about Lunch Money, all while also wanting to explore all the corners of Fukuoka, go on day trips, and spend time with friends and family who took the time to visit us abroad.  So I guess the issue was that I had too many things that I wanted to do but Lunch Money would always take up a disproportionately large amount of my time and energy.  To get over this, I realized that I had to reconcile my own feelings of guilt. It felt weird to be in such a privileged position of living abroad in Japan, yet spending almost all my waking hours in front of a laptop. Then I realized, who cares? I was happy. I was feeling fulfilled every day and I felt incredibly lucky to have all this time to work on a side project. I was thriving and I realized I hadn’t felt this way in a long time and I just needed to embrace my new lifestyle. ‍  The biggest disadvantage of starting a personal finance and budgeting app is that building trust with that first cohort of users is very hard. Typically, a beta testing round would include friends and family, but this can be especially difficult when it comes to something as private as finances. I knew I wasn’t going to try to convince somebody to trust my app with their personal data. That would have to come from within themselves, stemming from a desire to use a product that I created. So the best thing I could focus on to grow my initial user base was to create a product that was irresistible to trial! No single mistake that I’ve made was detrimental, but I can think of a lot of potential mistakes I could have made which would totally have derailed the progress of Lunch Money. I’d have to attribute the avoidance of these to being a solo founder– since I’m stretched so thin, I don’t actually have time to dive so deep into one thing that I lose sight of where I should be going. I’m constantly re-prioritizing the most important things to do and if something is taking me more than, say, 1 week, I think really hard about whether or not it’s really worth that time. The biggest mistake I could have made was creating a mobile app pre-launch. Lunch Money’s MVP was a web app and I was continuously haunted by the thought that not having a mobile app would put me at a huge disadvantage. About 3 weeks before my Hacker News launch, I set out to learn an entirely new framework (Flutter) AND programming language (Dart). I followed tutorials, listened to podcasts, and always tried to fit time for mobile app development in between feature improvements and bug fixes. It was a few weeks of frustration with myself that I was so slow to get this mobile app out! Talk about high expectations... Thankfully, other tasks started piling on so much that I re-evaluated the need for a mobile app and decided that it wasn’t necessary for launch. As a compromise, I priced my product much lower than competitors and hoped for the best. As it turns out, the demand for a mobile app was not as high as I thought it would be. In fact, after launch, it became apparent that most users were more interested in seeing the product continue to grow and develop, rather than being available on another platform. ‍",," This is a very loaded question, so I’ll try my best to answer this from various angles. Revenue-wise, the dream is to have Lunch Money match the income I would be making had I stayed in Silicon Valley. To me, this would help validate everything I’ve done up to this point. From a personal philosophical standpoint, I don’t like to set goals too far in the future. I don’t think it’s helpful to have big aspirations when the steps to get there are not clearly defined. In general, I like to set goals that I can see myself attaining in the next 1-3 months, and I like to set new goals often. For instance, I recently hit $35,000 ARR. My next goal is to hit $45,000, then $55,000, and so on!  In terms of growing the company, I would actually love to continue going at this as a one-woman team. I have come this far on my own, and there’s no reason why I shouldn’t continue and I feel a need to find out for myself just how far I can take this. Of course, I have a great network of friends who are experts in areas I have very little knowledge in so I often tap into them for help. But in terms of growing a team and creating a company out of Lunch Money, it’s not currently on my radar. And finally, the goal has always been to have Lunch Money eventually make my life easier, not harder :) ‍",," The idea of Lunch Money started when my husband and I first moved to Toronto. Since I hadn’t been tracking my spending consistently during my sabbatical, I figured it would be a good time to start doing so since we were now more permanently settled and starting to share our finances. I started a Google Sheet and we diligently tracked all our spending for months. Since we were still traveling a lot, this Google Sheet also had to take into account multiple currencies and exchange rates. It quickly became too much to manage. I always had the idea to turn our spreadsheet into the app – I knew that if I could break out of the confines of Google Sheet, I could build something that was better designed with more computational freedom. I finally decided that I would start working on this initiative in Fukuoka. The plan was to decrease my freelancing hours to free up more time for this new endeavor. The initial designs were done in Sketch and I followed very closely the layout of my Google Sheet. I picked my stack to be a mix of familiar (React, Node.js, Postgresql) and unfamiliar (Semantic UI, Typescript, Redis). From January to April while we were in Fukuoka, my schedule was more or less like so: Wake up at 7:30am to attend stand-up for one of my freelancing companiesWork 2 hours for company #1 and another 2 hours for company #2Go to the gymCome home and cook lunch (a.k.a. practice cooking using Japanese ingredients!)Finish lunch and head to a co-working space to hammer out Lunch Money work, usually from 2:30pm until 7pm when our stomachs would start grumbling.Go out for dinnerGo home and work until we sleep (usually another 3 more hours of Lunch Money work) I don’t think I have ever been so disciplined in anything else in my life, but then again it’s hard to think of another time in my life when I was so motivated by what I was doing. It had been a long time since I have been consumed by a programming project and I was loving every single minute of it. My first goal was to get an MVP that my husband and I could use. I achieved this in early February. My second goal was for us to get completely off of our spreadsheet. I achieved this one month later in early March.  I started collecting private beta sign-ups via a simple landing page with a few screenshots between February and June. It was a long and arduous process to implement all the features I wanted for private beta and to polish everything up. Finally, in July, I launched a private beta to a group of about 50 friends and a few strangers. For the next few weeks, I collected feedback and worked tirelessly to continuously improve the product. I hadn’t thought about anything related to marketing or pricing– I just wanted to make my early adopters love the product first.  It was time to think about pricing. From my previous experience at the pet health start-up, I knew that I would not offer a free tier. We offered a free tier before and it was demoralizing spending so much time answering support emails from people who were never going to pay us for our time. I landed on a free trial which would eventually convert into a monthly or yearly plan. I picked an initial pricing of $3/month or $29/year which I felt was reasonably low for anyone to give my app a chance! In mid-August, I started having this sinking feeling that not having a solid marketing strategy was going to be my downfall. I had no real plan on how to get more users and my few attempts at posting on Reddit got me banned from some of the most popular finance-related subreddits. Not a great start. Then one day, on a whim, I decided to post a Show HN on Hacker News to introduce my product. Long story short, I ended up #1 on Show HN and on the front page for almost 24 hours. I got nearly 1000 signups within just a few hours! I stayed up that night responding to every single support email and diligently adding tasks to my Asana. I couldn’t believe that complete strangers were actually excited about something I had built! It took a few days to realize that I was now in a new phase of Lunch Money and there was no going back. ‍",,," To be honest, I don’t think that I would do anything differently. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire process and journey and I wouldn’t trade it for anything else. There are minor things, like being too afraid of launching too early or getting anxious about sending out newsletter campaigns, but in hindsight, it was all necessary for my personal growth as a solo founder.  ‍"," By no means am I a marketer. I am through and through an engineer with an engineer’s brain (plus maybe a bit of a designer’s brain, too). But to make it clear, it’s hard for me to understand what moves the needle and how to measure the effectiveness of different strategies. That being said, I’ve tried a number of things, such as: reaching out to journalists, replying to random people on Twitter or Reddit, buying ads, etc. None of it worked. And I didn’t particularly love inserting a sales pitch into random people’s lives for a product that wasn’t totally fleshed out. So I continued to do what I love doing, which is 1. improving Lunch Money, and 2. sharing my stories through writing. Lucky for me, both of these have in one way or another contributed to the biggest spikes I have experienced thus far. Writing about my experience as a solo founder and posting them on mediums such as Hacker News, LinkedIn, Twitter and Indie Hackers have proven to be most successful in drawing new users to Lunch Money. And continuously improving Lunch Money keeps my current users happy and drives word-of-mouth marketing. As of now, word-of-mouth marketing and blogging are my best marketing tactics. Word-of-mouth is great because it’s effortless on my part and will grow naturally as I continue to invest in my user’s happiness and satisfaction. Blogging about my experiences and learnings is something that I love to do and I always try to find new and interesting angles to write from. Here are some recent examples of how these tactics helped Lunch Money grow: A few users commented and recommended Lunch Money on a Hacker News post of an article about the downfall of Mint. The comment was probably about 10 comments down from the top, but still drove over 300 signups.A famous Dutch tech influencer Tweeted about Lunch Money and drove over 200 signups.My recent blog post, ""The biggest mistakes I’ve made with Lunch Money (so far)"", made it to the front page of Hacker News and drove over 500 signups. The best part is that all of these are compounding since more and more people will become aware of Lunch Money. My recent blog post which first gained exposure on Hacker News ended up being mentioned by a few other publications including a Japanese podcast!"," I am @lunchbag on Twitter, and I also blog at lunchbag.ca where you can sign up for a mailing list in which I send out more personal updates.  Lunch Money lives at lunchmoney.app and I tweet about new features from @lunchmoney_app. Some blog posts of interest: ‍Life in Fukuoka: Building an app, freelancing, and living abroad‍My journey so far‍The biggest mistakes I’ve made with Lunch Money (so far)Optimizations as a company of one"," Here are three resources that have inspired me in my journey: Book: Mindset: The New Psychology of Success by Carol S.

138,mailbrew," Hi Failory, thanks so much for this interview. I’m Fabrizio, an Italian maker, designer, and filmmaker, currently working on Mailbrew full-time. I’m from the South of Italy, and I’ve always been passionate about creativity and art. I studied filmmaking in Bologna, I have a background in 3D graphics, I’ve briefly worked in VFX and I’ve directed a short film. I also love photography and, in short, I’m obsessed with anything visual. I’ve co-founded my startup Superlinear with Francesco in late 2018 when we decided to quit our job in a fast-growing tech startup based in Milan to go all-in on our side-projects. Me and Francesco originally met on Twitter a few years ago and started working together on Boxy, an Inbox by Gmail client for Mac, without ever meeting in person. Boxy was a huge success and the beginning of a lasting friendship for me and Francesco. In the company we joined (and left) together, we worked on apps used by millions of people, and an app I’ve designed was chosen by Apple to be installed and showcased in iPhone in Apple Stores worldwide. It was a crazy and beautiful experience, so quitting was a tough decision.  Before deciding to quit that company, we actually launched a new side-project, Boxy Suite, a premium Gmail client for Mac. The launch was really successful, so after a few months, we finally decided to quit the job and co-found Superlinear. Quitting a nice tech job in the business center of Milan was the scariest choice of my life, and the first few months after that were pretty confusing. My whole 2019 was a rollercoaster, and me and Francesco didn’t just work a lot, but also traveled more, and embraced more personal endeavours as well. Luckily between our personal savings and the revenues from the Boxy Suite launch (~40k USD in the first 3 months), we had some leeway to get things started on our own. Currently, our main focus is on Mailbrew. We launched it on March 3 after around 6 months in private beta, which felt like an eternity. Mailbrew is our most ambitious project to date: it’s an app that saves you hours of time by sending email digests about your favorite topics, on your schedule.  Users can pick their favorite sources (Twitter accounts, Subreddits, Blogs, anything), select a schedule, and receive beautiful emails with the best content from these sources — this way they can unplug from feeds and stop checking multiple websites every day. I reached out to DHH asking him to try it during the beta, and he’s been really supportive since then. He even tweeted:  “I've been using Mailbrew to keep up with Twitter peeps who don't post often, but whom I'd really hate to miss what they have to say. It's pretty awesome. In many ways, Twitter-over-email is the healthier Twitter!” Having DHH as a user and testimonial was incredibly motivating while working on the beta, and in these few months we’ve found other engaged users which fell in love with Mailbrew, and that gave us confidence that we were on the right path. Our very first paying user was Pat Walls. We’ve always been inspired by his projects and work ethic, so it was great to have that kind of validation early on. ",," A huge weak spot for us has always been growth and marketing. We had multiple successful launches that made us rest on our laurels a lot, while we could be much more successful if we invested more time and energy in finding and growing our customer base. Even with a product like Boxy Suite (well positioned on Google and appealing to a large audience) we didn’t really do much content marketing, SEO, and growth for a lot of time, and this was a big missed opportunity. Luckily we started doing that later on and we’re starting to see results. Another challenge we’re always facing is to find the perfect work/life balance, allowing us to pursue personal passions while still working side by side and being productive and efficient. We’ve surely improved a lot in this regard, and I feel like honesty and good communication between co-founders are key here. Personally, I think my most challenging months were right after I quit my job. Suddenly having so much time for myself, and a world of possibilities, paradoxically made me depressed and unmotivated. I had to rebuild my routines, understand my priorities, and basically find out what I really wanted. That’s why 2019 has been such a transformative year for me, while I feel like 2020 is the year where I’m reaping what I sowed in the last few years.   If I had to pick a single big mistake we repeatedly did, is rushing our launches. Sometimes we worked for weeks or even months on a product, only to then plan and launch it in a few days. This means not taking advantage of a lot of low-hanging fruits and not really playing all your cards. We surely put much more thought into it now, and we also launch more often. Taking the time to prepare to launch doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it every few months. ",," We’re really betting a lot on Mailbrew. It’s not just another project, another thing we want to try before going to the next one. We’re treating it as its own startup, investing nearly all our time on it, and trying to keep track of the right metrics to make sure we’re always focusing on the right things. Monetization-wise, while we started with a pretty convoluted 4-plan paywall, and experimented with a trial with credit card, before launching we decided to simplify everything and go with a limited Free plan, and a single comprehensive Pro plan that costs $10/m. Users appreciated this change, and one person converted instantly to the Pro plan when seeing the new paywall. We even had users like Pat Walls who started paying for Mailbrew when it was still in its early stages and very limited, and that was a very nice indication that this was indeed something people would be willing to pay for. Going forward, we want to make sure to not add features and sources for the sake of it, while instead being more high-touch than usual with customers to understand what they really need. ",," When we first started working on our side-projects, me and Francesco were a pretty standard designer-dev duo. Lately, the lines have been blurring a lot, a while Francesco still does the bulk of development, I started working on the frontend of our apps, which are built with React. We’re pretty fast now, and we can build React prototypes of our ideas quickly, especially since we’ve created our own UI Kit, which is a set of components that are easily customizable and reusable. All these components are styled from a single, centrale JSON file. This means that when I change the branding of the Mailbrew.com website, even heavily, I can then copy the necessary parts of the UI Kit configuration, paste inside the Mailbrew app config, and see the app magically transform according to the new branding. Mailbrew has been particularly challenging though since each user is able to create and customize email newsletters, so we needed a newsletters template system, a backend that can generate them, a frontend that displays a live preview of the newsletter while you edit it and so on. In this regard, having a close beta proved to be essential since the first version of the apps was very rough around the edges, and also way slower than it is now. We’re much more confident releasing it to the public after these months of work and fine-tuning. Another big obstacle has been positioning. While we had our own idea of what Mailbrew is and who it is for, seeing our first few hundreds of users using it was essential in understanding what the value proposition is.  Not, for example, during the onboarding, we ask you what’s your role, and then after a few weeks of usage, we ask you to take a survey asking you a few questions that help us understand what’s Mailbrew for you. All of this, together, was incredibly helpful to craft a great landing page and shape the product you see today. ",," In 2019, during our digital nomad stint, we’ve launched a newsletters network called Unreadit. It received a warm welcome online, great testimonials, and has been growing steadily since launch. Basically, we’ve created different newsletters with the best content on many topics, sourcing from Reddit. Initially, they were all manually curated, while now we’ve automated most of them, and just edit the most popular ones. It started generating revenue from sponsorship, but it’s really unpredictable: some months $0, others $1000. We also felt like it was time to take it to the next level and let users craft their own newsletters. That’s when we realized that this is something that could provide real value to people, and we wanted it ourselves: an app to create beautiful automated newsletters on any topic. So we started working on Mailbrew. Initially, it lets you create newsletters mixing any subreddit and RSS Feed, and offering few customizations. During the private beta, we added many features and possible customizations, and new sources like Twitter, Hacker News and YouTube. What started as a “tool to create automated newsletters” slowly became much more ambitious. A way to truly unplug from feeds, keep in touch with things and people you care about, and really be on top of your game by getting essential information on any topic, every day or week.",,," I have a personal website where people can learn a bit more about me, and I definitely recommend checking out Mailbrew. I’m putting my soul in it and every new person that uses it and gives me feedback means the world to me. I’m a Twitter junkie so maybe you can follow me there."," My recommendation is just to keep your mind open. Sometimes I get my biggest insights from essays and books that have nothing to do with entrepreneurship and startup. Sometimes watching a great film and listening to a great conversation are more helpful than trying to find hacks and shortcuts. For instance, I love Malcolm Gladwell’s books. They are extremely insightful and dig into parts of the human mind and nature that can be really enlightening.

139,mangools," Hi Failory readers, my name is Peter. I’m the founder and CEO at Mangools. We develop a super-easy-to-use package of SEO tools. Our HQ is in Bratislava, Slovakia but I was born and raised in the marvelous city of Banska Stiavnica. Seriously, you should visit it someday :) I started programming when I was about twelve. I dreamed of developing a product that would attract thousands of people. The D-day came when I launched the very first version of KWFinder in 2014. At that time, I had many other projects running yet many of them failed. I’m not a pro developer, so I always create a prototype and launch it asap. Nowadays, KWFinder is part of the Mangools SEO tools package. There are 5 tools that cover a lot of SEO stuff. The tools are developed, marketed and supported by 11 people on the team. Our mission is to make SEO easy for everyone so the data, UX and user interface are all about that. Up until May 2019, our business model was freemium but we got to a point where we decided to discontinue our “forever free” plan. Now we have a full-featured 10-day free trial and 3 tiers of paid subscriptions with monthly/annual billing options. ",," The biggest challenge is to find the right niche at the right time and provide a product that would fulfill the customer’s needs. I managed to do so by launching KWFinder and then creating Mangools SEO tools package with the team. It also taught me how to delegate tasks and let the teammates do what they are best at. When it comes to my personal stuff, I already mentioned that I had a lot of experience with online businesses, development and marketing. My knowledge wasn’t so deep but it was good enough for the start :) However, when KWFinder became a serious thing I realized it’s impossible to manage it on my own.  I would say that the whole team is a fan of trying new things and doing experiments. Many of our decisions are not based on any analysis. Sometimes it’s pure intuitive decision making. It works in most of the cases but the bigger we are, the harder it gets.  We recently switched from a freemium subscription model to a time-limited free trial which brought a lot of changes. We’re still analyzing the pros and cons. I must say that it forced us to make some decisions backed up by serious analysis. We’ll see how it goes but I guess it’s a natural thing as the business grows. We are learners, nobody in the team had previous experience with running a business that got to $2.7 million yearly revenue in less than 4 years. When it comes to our brand Mangools, to be honest, I wasn’t thinking that far ahead when I was starting with KWFinder. There was nothing like Mangools on the plan. A couple of years after, it’s a bit of a pity because KWFinder is still the bigger buzzword compared to Mangools but we are working on it. ‍",,,," As I mentioned earlier, it all started in 2014 when I launched the first version of KWFinder. The development process took me about one month. Right after, I posted it on Reddit, HackerNews and some other forums. This was the first-ever marketing activity done for KWFinder which stood behind its early success.  Given the fact that I was already a technically oriented person with experience in the online field, I was quickly available to launch and market the product without any third-party help such as investors or developers. This helped me to test KWFinder’s potential in a short time with almost no costs. Since there are two sides to every coin, my universality became an obstacle when the tool started skyrocketing. My main concern was the delegation of the tasks. It took me a while to get through it but at the end of the day, I must say that thanks to the people that joined me during the last 5 years, we all managed to bring Mangools on the level on which it currently is. ",," I’m not a perfectionist. My aim is to launch a fully-functional prototype and collect feedback from real users. That’s exactly what happened with KWFinder. I shared it on Reddit and the feedback was awesome. At that time, I didn’t think about Mangools, a brand that would cover more SEO tools. I had many different projects before Mangools. They included web development, affiliate websites, e-shops, domaining, and SaaS businesses. SaaS is a business field that truly attracts my attention. It gives me enough space to be creative and focused on the development of my own product. Before KWFinder, I developed some online marketing tools to cover my needs. I kind of hoped there would be more people with the same needs. I’m not a fan of deep analyses and business plans so I always use my intuition to evaluate the market potential. Why did these projects fail? Well, sometimes I lost the enthusiasm to finish them. In other cases, I missed the good old product-market fit. The competition on global markets is enormous so coming up with an idea that hits the market at the right time while customers are willing to pay for it is like looking for a needle in a haystack."," In all honesty, I would do things more or less the same. Maybe I would try to finish some of the earlier projects, at least the online tools I used to work on before Mangools. Many times, I haven’t finished a prototype and forgot about the whole idea. But you know what? I would do one thing related to Mangools differently. I would push the whole project more even before it started growing that rapidly. That means I would build the team and delegate tasks a lot sooner than I did. I lost some time by not doing so. When it comes to really helpful things, I would mention my brute-force attitude, namely the focus on quick release to test the market potential. I try to do this every time I can so I basically do a lot of experiments. ‍"," Until summer 2016, the growth of Mangools was purely organic. We basically didn’t do any targeted marketing activities, PPC campaigns or anything else. I’m familiar with marketing. I’m a fan of some controversial, let’s say grey-hat techniques that force you to experiment but there were no serious marketing activities done for Mangools. That’s why my 2 teammates Frantisek, Martin and I decided to move things up so Maros joined us in July 2016. He was the first guy dedicated to marketing at that time. At first, we focused on the low-hanging fruit. Setting up proper analytics and remarketing campaigns in Google Ads brought us hundreds of new subscriptions. These days, we work a lot with behavioral emailing and inbound marketing thanks to great content. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that a company behind SEO tools has to do SEO as well :) We play with it all the time and optimize all our websites both from the technical and content point of view. We recently hired a new teammate who’s responsible for link building as we see a lot of opportunities in the off-page field too. ‍"," Since we do a lot of stuff aimed at content marketing, make sure to visit our blog if you are interested in some cool SEO tips and in-depth guides. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that we are fans of acquisitions. Our goal is to diversify the revenue stream and not to depend solely on one niche. Of course, to leverage what we’ve learned, we aim for SaaS businesses yet not in the SEO field. Our pilot project is EmailListVerify, a tool for email marketers that we acquired last year. We are currently working on another acquisition but since it’s not finished, I won’t say more than that :) When it comes to Mangools, we are working on a set of free SEO tools and high-quality content to boost our brand as an SEO authority. On top of that, we focus on improving the quality of the data and redesigning the tools to boost their UX even more."," Learning by doing is a method that I stick to. Besides that, I like reading books and news about economics, investments and business topics. When it comes to other sources, I love Twitter because it filters all the thrash I would need to swim through. It’s fast and you can easily pick the piece of information that attracts you. ‍",,Software & Hardware,,Slovakia,"September 19, 2019",Peter Hrbacik,https://www.failory.com/interview/mangools,"['https://mangools.com/blog/', 'https://www.emaillistverify.com/', 'https://mangools.com/free-seo-tools/']",success,1,$100k-$500k/mo,"What started as a simple tool to find keywords has turned into a SaaS that makes over $250,000 per month and employs 8 members.

140,manyrequests," My name is Robin, I am 29 and I am working on ManyRequests. Our team is spread across South-East Asia and Latin America, where most of our developers are located. ManyRequests is a client portal and help desk software for agencies.  In short: We help agencies get organized so they can grow their business. From payments to client onboarding to handling client requests, files, reports, and automations and smart workflows. Our business model is subscription-based agencies pay us a subscription fee (between $79/mo and $299/mo currently). ",," The biggest obstacle to starting a SaaS in our industry is competition. There are already tens of tremendous VC-backed competitors in niches related to ours: Project management tools, collaboration and productivity software, as well as help desk tools. To do this, finding a niche and working on positioning helped. Positioning our product as “Made for agencies” and tweaking features to solve their exact needs was a way to differentiate ourselves from the competition. In addition, building our distribution channels (our Facebook community and content) before making the product was helpful to get the initial traction. Our biggest mistake was to focus on “starters”.  Initially, we had decided to go for productized services and wanted to help anyone start a productized service. However, this was a mistake because those customers didn’t have a business yet and didn’t need most of the features our software offered. They also churned fast as they didn’t generate income yet to pay for our software. ",," Today we are profitable, growing steadily, and are fully remote, which is a position we are incredibly thankful for. We will be hiring a couple of roles this year, starting with one additional software engineer. We don’t share revenue/profits -- at least for now. Our goal for the future is to continue growing the business steadily.",," The prototype was launched in late 2019, with some members of our community as early adopters. To be honest, it didn’t meet my co-founder and my expectations. It was our first time building a product, and we had like 5 customers.  But we didn’t give up. We decided to rewrite the product thoroughly and completely revamped the UI. Customers loved it, and we relaunched around July 2020 the current version. In the early days, we spent a lot of time talking to our customers. We tried knowing their “Job-to-be-Done” with our product and even asked them if we could record calls we had with them to build exactly what was needed.",," Before ManyRequests, I built two other companies. During my law studies, I started an apartment rental service for international students and expats. After that, I co-founded a design outsourcing service that is still going strong with a university friend. I have always had a passion for entrepreneurship. Starting and growing something from scratch gives me immense satisfaction.  The idea from ManyRequests came during my last business. Back then, we managed 30 designers and hundreds of clients, and the project management or help desk software available was not suited for that type of business. In addition, around 2018, I started relating my entrepreneurial journey online, mainly through a Facebook group called Productize.Community where I matched other service-based entrepreneurs. The combination of scratching my own itch and connecting with other entrepreneurs who experienced the same problem made me decide to start ManyRequests. ‍"," Since I started my entrepreneurial journey, one of my biggest lessons is to create a service-based business or an agency. The main reason is that it’s not capital intensive, and you learn how to deal with clients (client onboarding and client service), which is key to building any business. Starting two agencies before my SaaS has been my “MBA” and provided me with a financial cushion to attempt riskier ventures like SaaS. When it comes to starting an idea, pick a niche where you have a specific “insight”.  To take the example of my first business, I started my studies abroad. I knew how hard it was to rent a place. I wished real estate agents would offer video viewings, websites in English, and high-quality photos. That “insight” was my competitive edge (+ the fact that I was way hungrier for money than real estate agents who had been doing that for years).  Now you might think: But how do I get insights? The best way is to start working for someone or hang out in different communities or take a bet on yourself and go abroad. It sounds cliche to say, but the dots may connect later. Today, I am mostly trying to self-improve. Raising funds from Calm Capital was for a financial reason and I also wanted to access their community of entrepreneurs, which are a few steps ahead of me. Twitter (and especially B2B SaaS and Productized services founders) is the way. ‍"," I would say it was a mix. Early on, it was our community and some outreach. Now, we’re primarily focusing on SEO, and we might tap into other channels later. Traction for a SaaS is slow at the beginning. But again, don’t give up! SaaS revenue compounds. If you see you have 10 customers, you can probably get 10 more, then 20 more, etc.  In the beginning, focus on positioning and on refining your value proposition. We repositioned 2-3 times since we launched and did many customer interviews to ensure the customers we were after were a good fit for our business. I like to approach marketing as building a product: Marketing should solve problems for your users. So we create content that conveys the messaging on how our product can solve the problems of our target users. Educational blog posts, tips, and tricks in our community, etc. In addition, I think it’s essential to choose a channel where the unit economics make sense for your business. If your SaaS is $10/month, it’s mostly going to be self-serve and product-led growth and SEO. However, if you’re selling a $1,000/month B2B service or productized service, you can probably invest in outreach. Lastly, knowing our SaaS numbers early on can help you with decision making. Next to marketing, our key priority is retention. In August 2021, we got negative net churn for the first time, which was an incredible feeling.

141,marketmuse," Hi, my name is Jeff Coyle and I’m the co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer for MarketMuse. I’m based in Jacksonville, Florida but grew up in New Jersey.  MarketMuse is a content strategy and intelligence platform that helps teams create the best possible content they can in the eyes of search engines and their audience. We aim to set the standard for content quality.  Our patented AI collects and analyzes your content, prioritizes your best opportunities based on authority and ROI and generates initial drafts, and builds industry-leading topic models so you can always write the best content on any topic. Currently, I am focused on strategic growth projects for the company. I’m driving the expanded use case of our natural language technology product, and a recent acquisition of GrepWords, the largest keyword database on the market that offers topic intelligence to help teams confidently measure their market. This AI-generated content solution that we're working on, enables marketing teams to create content and build complete customer journeys at scale. The language model builds the generated output based on the associated MarketMuse Content Brief outline, a detailed content outline with unique knowledge graphs for each subheading.  We then apply another layer of expertise by feeding the AI model a select number of additional 1-3K articles on the topic, further training the model to become an expert before the generation is created. This enables us to produce comprehensive, high-quality, long-form content through our model. ",," I wish we had adopted the RACI matrix (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) much earlier as a company. Sometimes we would move too fast, and the proper internal organization and communication weren’t done or was messy.  At times, this slowed us down afterward to backtrack and fix things or stalled us to move to the next phase as the proper steps were brought in. Excitement, urgency, and determination to get things done are outstanding attributes, but a method like RACI improves internal communication and accountability. The content optimization market has grown in the last few years. We were so early in the market that we spent a lot of time educating on the process and opportunity the technology presented. Now content optimization has almost become standard practice, which is great because the conversations have shifted away from education. Still, it also means there are a lot of players in the space. Now the discussions are around specific feature sets and comparing vendors. Content optimization isn’t the only aspect of our platform. We have a comprehensive inventory system with proprietary metrics for identifying opportunities and gaps across a domain during the content strategy and planning process. That coupled with content optimization is incredibly powerful.  We should have focused on freemium and product-led growth sooner. Because the market wasn’t mature and it was an unknown need, sales often drove product decisions. We innovated against enterprise needs, which worked out well for us at the time but had we taken a product-led approach sooner, it would have simplified our offering and made it more approachable and accessible. We’re excited to have a freemium offering now, and the product-led adoption is now part of our core decision-making, which is great to see. ",," We are heading into a growth phase. We have an aggressive product roadmap that we’re hiring to ensure we can achieve. We also have a bold revenue goal for the next few years, so we’re scaling up our marketing and sales teams as well. I really can’t wait, it’s going to be very exciting. We recently launched a free package that has exceeded all expectations. It’s something we’ve always wanted to do, and I’m so glad to see that come to life. We have a free package, a self-serve package for those who wish to pay monthly and have unlimited benefits, and a Premium annual package for larger websites, networks, and agencies with large inventories and data requirements. ",," We ran a significant pilot with a publisher across several of their domains. All of our use cases and personas were represented with this publisher to validate our workflows and get a deep understanding of the impact across the entire content process. I’ve been a practitioner my entire career, so I also knew my process’s pain points and bottlenecks very well. However, they weren’t frequently discussed or documented.  The idea of data-driven content optimization, strategy, and planning was not common in 2014, even though Google made a dramatic change to its algorithm in 2013 that required a mindset shift.  We focused a lot on educating the market. I also brought in several peers from my network to leverage their feedback and perspectives. We also spoke often with our customers to make sure we met their needs.",," I was focused on my consulting business before I met Aki Balogh, President & MarketMuse co-founder. I focused on SEO and content strategies to help clients solve technical problems and gain an advantage in search engine results. Previously I led the Traffic, Search, and Engagement team for seven years at TechTarget, a leader in B2B technology publishing and lead generation. I helped Aki drive the direction of MarketMuse based on my experience in the search field. I was responsible for the SEO strategy for dozens of websites at TechTarget. It takes hours to do the keyword, competitive, and link research required for a single article, no less for an entire network. I saw the potential in MarketMuse immediately around creating a single place for someone to automatically audit their site, identify gaps, seek opportunities and scale high-quality output -- and that’s what MarketMuse does today. We’re excited to get deeper into AI-generated content. We’ve been building and honing our model for a few years and believe this will be a game-changer for scaling content. It won’t replace writers, but instead, it will augment their process, especially for the less creative content types. Imagine writing descriptive product material for an entire catalog in a matter of hours instead of weeks writing by hand. The use cases for this industry are truly game-changing. "," The goal of the business should not be about outcomes or exits. Goals should be around building a fantastic product that solves a real business process and building a team that you trust, are confident in, and bring skills that you don’t have or are better than yours. If you’re too focused on the exit strategy, you lose sight of why you’re in business in the first place. We are a lean team, so we rely on a lot of technology to help us save time and make better decisions. Madkudu is one technology that has completely changed how we approach our leads and funnel. They created a model based on our closed-won opportunities, and any new lead that comes in is scored against that. There’s no subjectivity or waiting until we have more data on them. We can act faster and eliminate internal debates about quality.  I like to think about how technology can take a process that takes a lot of time and doesn’t take a particular skill to do. Lead scoring is one of those things, along with personalization and topic/competitive research, among many other things.  We continue to bring that kind of technology into our tech stack and have not regretted it."," We’ve relied primarily on word of mouth and our inbound marketing engine. We built up our blog, optimized conversion rates, and launched an educational webinar series. We pride ourselves on educating our audience first, whether they choose to work with us or not, so they receive some value from us that impacts their strategy. We also often participate in in-person and digital events like webinars, podcasts, Twitter spaces, etc. Over the past year, I have been a guest on over 50 podcasts on the topic of AI, content marketing, and SEO strategy. These are wonderful ways to connect with our audience as they research and work through their pain points or seek advice on content strategy. This is that educational piece again -- it’s so important to offer your expertise through content and build credibility if you want a chance at converting your audience to customers. We saw a dramatic burst in Q4 of 2015. We honed our sales process and tapped into our network to drive opportunities. Word-of-mouth then started playing a more significant role. Since we were proposing a novel concept, people were interested in learning more. Nothing can replace the moment you see people experience the ah-ha moments of your platform, and the wheels start turning on the possibilities ahead of them. We know our audience very well. Our Premium offering is compelling and gives you an advantage, but it’s not for everyone because it’s an investment. We’ve created products that work for all budget sizes (even $0) and work closely with the organizations we know are an excellent fit for our Premium offering -- then we grow together.

142,matboard-and-more," Hi! I am an Engineer/MBA that couldn’t survive the 9-5. In 2012 I realized no corporate job would give me what I wanted in life and the opportunity came up to work on Matboard and More which is now the number one online retailer of custom matting and framing in the US. The picture framing industry is one of the oldest in the world and we saw that with some technology and sophistication we could create something new and fresh. You can now easily order custom mats and frames in any color, size, and quantity with just a few clicks. I’ve been in charge of Marketing and Business Development since we launched. Most of my focus is on the digital side, including PPC and SEO. We are currently working on getting our mobile site updated and I’m extremely excited to see that go live :D ‍",," The most difficult parts of running and growing Matboard and More is team management. As much as I desire total control and freedom in my life and business, it's never completely possible as you don't work in a vacuum. There are always going to different opinions, competing personalities and managing those is the most difficult. I won't go into more detail than that as it delves into the personal but suffice to say, conflict is only productive when it's focused on tasks and processes, so don't let things get personal. The other big challenge was that I knew nothing about either matboards or digital marketing. This didn't scare me as I've always been a fast learner but when you think that I started from literally zero knowledge and self-taught myself to the point where Matboard and More is number one in SEO and PPC in the industry, I do feel proud of that. All I can say to that effect is that it was extremely fun and never felt like work. I love learning and having a challenge. The hard part is defining the problem, once you understand that it's a matter of simply working through it. I think most entrepreneurs that fail aren't really sure what problem they are solving so they don't have a clear direction. For me it was simple at first, improve conversions and increase ROI. Everything was focused on that and through experimentation, iteration and a lot of intuition we found the right sauce.    There have been a few critical moments where we've screwed up as a business, but thankfully we bounced back stronger each time. Some of these mistakes were simple stupidity, others stemmed from a lack of planning. For example, our display ads were suspended for a few weeks because I didn't get the email notifying that me that we were not in compliance with AdWords policy. I was out of town and not checking the campaigns regularly. That was a significant loss and was plainly just not paying attention, but easy enough to fix. A more serious problem was during our second Christmas season where we got way more business than expected. We could hardly keep up, and our machines broke down so it was weeks of nearly 24/7 working trying to get things up and running. We spent the next year focusing on in-house systems and technologies instead of the website. It was a tough decision that slowed down growth but we had limited resources and all that work helped set us up for the future growth. As a general principle though, we probably made a lot of mistakes of inaction as much as mistakes of action as well. We probably should have put more resources into certain areas and pushed our growth earlier. This may still be the case in fact, but it's difficult to know and hindsight is 20/20. ‍",,," This one is easy for me. My biggest disadvantage is that I work remotely in Toronto. We don't even ship orders to Canada so I can't utilize my network here. It's also difficult to stay engaged when you feel like your whole business is on a laptop. When I visit our headquarters in Atlanta it's amazing how motivating it is. I get to meet with my partners and discuss strategy. I get to walk through our facilities and face to face talk to our amazing employees. It always feels like a lot gets done and my productivity increases tremendously when I'm more engaged. On the flip side, working remotely has tones of personal advantages and I wouldn't trade it for the world. That in itself has been a big personal motivator. The matboard market (minus frames) is fairly niche. Everyone knows what a frame is, but matboards have got to be one of the most pervasive products that few people actually know what they are called and made of. Literally everyone, has seen hundreds of mats in their lifetime but when you ask them about matboards you get a blank stare, until you explain it’s that inside border of the frame :) This lack of product awareness means that it’s tough getting as much traffic as we’d like to the website. We’ve maxed out our AdWords budgets for a long time and there simply isn’t more traffic to gain. This was tough because it limited our data and analysis. With frames, it’s the opposite problem of a hyper-competitive market where bids are expensive and rankings are tough to get. We’ve found a nice balance however, and with our new website which has a much better experience for purchasing frames we are confident we are going to gain a huge share in the frames market as well."," The initial website was very simple. Just a wizard that allowed you to pick a matboard, change the size and quantity and order. No accessories, very few options and a pretty rough layout. It worked though, we were getting orders! They just cost an arm and a leg in AdWords spend. In the first days, I called every customer that ordered to get feedback and also because I was so grateful to see success! I remember personally taking $200 orders at midnight because a customer needed something rushed. It was so much fun every order was like a signal from the heavens that we were going to make it. For the first year, all we did was pay for traffic, analyze that traffic, get feedback and iterate on our marketing campaigns and the website. After about a year we had a website that was turning a positive ROI on marketing spend and I had become an SEO/PPC expert. From there we added frames and other accessories. Continuously improved the website, built systems for production and customer service and kept growing. I will say having relatively slow and steady growth was probably a good thing. In those first years, we ran into lots of problems. Production couldn’t keep up, equipment would fail, employees would quit, partners would have kids (I kid, I love my nieces :)). It was fun though every day was a new challenge and we just kept at it. I do think we missed out on some opportunities by not investing more in technology and the website early on. We never got any outside financing for our business which was great but at the same time, an influx of money early on would have accelerated things. At any rate, by year three we were number one for most of our big keywords and had very effective PPC campaigns. The last couple years have been focused on launching a new site which is mobile friendly and much easier to use based on the learnings from the first version of the site. We hope to launch this soon and I believe it’s going to take us to another level!",," When I think of how I came to be involved in Matboard and More, there are three important parts of my life that came together to make it happen. One, I got my first job as an engineer designing traffic control devices. I was actually really passionate about traffic... because I hated it! I hated the powerlessness of sitting in front of a green light and still not being able to move because of the thousands of cars ahead of me. Traffic to me is a symbol of how screwed up our society is. How willing we are to waste hours a day commuting to places we don’t like. It’s become an accepted part of life, sitting in traffic, but I couldn’t do it. I would get stressed out of my mind thinking… waste of time, waste of energy, stupid… so I got a job in traffic thinking if I was working towards solving the problem it would make things easier. It did for a short time but then I realized this problem was going to be solved with self-driving cars and nothing else. My bigger realization through working as an engineer was that I hated not having control. I couldn’t control my schedule, what I worked on, who I worked with and most importantly when I could take my damned vacations! So, I realized that my personality is simply incompatible with working the standard job, and I needed to find work that gave me freedom. This became crystal clear to me in 2010 and I spent the rest of my life ensuring I would one day achieve my goal of controlling my own life. Two, I didn’t really have a clear idea of what I needed to do in order to gain that freedom and control in my life but I figured quitting my job and getting an MBA was a good start. The next two years I spent a lot of time reinventing myself from a nerdy engineer with limited social skills into a pretty cool guy who was not afraid to ask life for more. I can say that I didn’t learn a tone academically in my MBA but I gained the confidence to know I could be successful at whatever I put my mind to. I wrote a blog about this at the time. Third, circumstances came together perfectly when my brother and brother-in-law came to with me this awesome idea. I can’t take credit for the idea or the initial startup phase, I got involved as the site was getting ready to launch. You can’t underestimate the power of having a good team. Now since this is Failory, I should mention that during my MBA I specialized in Organizational Behavior and was looking to get into HR Consulting. For the life of me though I couldn’t get an interview, save for one with P&G. I guess I did terribly because they didn’t take me past the phone interview. I was actually devastated at this point because it was about 4 months on the job hunt (with loads of MBA debt) without any leads before Matboard and More came into the picture. So, to summarize, my drive for control and freedom, my transformation during my MBA and great partners were what made Matboard and More possible for me.  "," I would have pushed harder, earlier. When we first started out, we didn't have a good idea of how big this could be. I had a strong feeling early of a great opportunity this could be but frankly, my partners weren't as sure and we didn't sync up properly. Technology wasn't as focused as they needed to be. Production was working on our wholesale customers more than the e-commerce side. I could see from the digital marketing side that there was a lot of room for growth but it took us about four years to capture that. In the process, we missed the boat on mobile which we are just rectifying with our upcoming launch. These are all big opportunities missed, mostly because we weren't willing to risk and invest like we should have. At the same time, slow and steady has served us well and helped us work out a lot of kinks. I mentioned the Christmas rush and production issues which we needed to work through already, there were many of those types of things. ‍"," Our marketing strategy has been almost exclusively digital. We certainly have a presence at various art and trade shows around the country but we find time and time again that the most effective thing for us is Google. Showing up in search is so valuable and nothing in our marketing has ever come close. SEO and PPC are both very detail-oriented tasks, that require much patience and experimentation. I’d spend hours daily in the first couple years looking at our AdWords and optimizing them.  We now have gotten to a point where there is not much room left for optimizing and we’ve maximized our budget. I will say we are having a harder and harder time finding new avenues for marketing. Facebook hasn’t been successful, nor has social media as a whole. Mobile is where we have the most room for growth. Beyond that, we have lots of new products we are launching including new frames, and possibly prints in the near future. ‍", Check out our website and stay tuned for our mobile launch!," The internet is a massive resource, and there really aren't any specific sites I recommend over others. Reddit is a good source if you can get in with the appropriate communities. ‍",,e-Commerce,,United States,"February 21, 2019",Mehdi Kajbaf,https://www.failory.com/interview/matboard-and-more,['http://www.matboardandmore.com/'],success,1,$100k-$500k/mo,"Matboard and More is the number one online retailer of custom matting and framing in the US.

143,mealsurfers," I am Ali and I advise companies on product development and building data-focused services. I also have a podcast focused on groundbreaking graduate research called For Inquisitive Minds and another on building businesses called Serial Entrepreneurship with Ali & Upile. I am currently building an accessibility and advance care-related startup called Eberus. I also advise an emerging market fintech called Oraan. I started MealSurfers when I was 23 years old and ran it for about 2 years before selling it to a private fund. While selling the business sounds like a success story, deep down I know I could have done more. Ultimately the model, environment, team and timing were all factors in the sale. We were fortunate that we were one of the only companies executing this model that managed to sell our assets and earn an above average return on investment. Before I tell you my story, I’ll explain what MealSurfers was and why I started it. MealSurfers started as a way to connect home cooks with people who wanted to buy their food. I thought places with high population density like downtown Toronto, could use this model to meet their neighbours and find healthy food at a reasonable price. Some would say it’s like Uber for food, but it’s a little different, as I argued for TechVibes. The initial business model was to take a cut of the transactions but there were a number of pivots that changed this. As the business grew, we experimented with catering (charging businesses of all sizes for meals), food delivery for smaller food shops, charging for small food shops to set up their businesses (similar to cloud kitchens in a way) and running events. I’d argue we never focused on any of these revenue models long enough to see success - mostly because we started to bleed money. ‍ ‍ While I was the founder, I acknowledge I couldn’t have done this on my own, and I want to give my gratitude to my day ones - Justin, Etan, Halima, Neil and Ankit. While this was not the entire team, they all played a huge role in shaping and moving the vision to where it ended up. As I write this, I end each question with a ‘TlDR’. If you want the full answer you can read it, but if you’re in a rush, just check out the end. ‍"," I struggled a lot with deciding whether I would call MealSurfers a public success or a public failure. A rational definition of success for a startup is usually an exit or even a soft landing. Some sort of monetary return for your time spent. As you know. however, entrepreneurs are irrational. Success to us is always about something greater than money. Maybe it’s legacy, maybe it’s a mission, maybe it’s respect. If you consider those three things, I would actually say this was not a success.  -----  We exited MealSurfers for a number of reasons. We didn’t obtain enough recurring customers, we faced constant regulatory hurdles, our team was not as dedicated as they could be, and I was too hung up on our initial business model. If I had to choose one reason above all, it would be my fault for sticking with the business model for too long. For not pivoting successfully and not listening to the market. In the end, to blame anything else for a startup not reaching its potential, is really a failure in recognizing your own shortcomings. I think anyone who is adaptable and has grit can build a business successfully. Taking responsibility for my shortcomings helped me see how I can make improvements to future businesses. When I was operating the business, however, I didn’t recognize these areas of opportunity. I blamed the first three things I mentioned. Less than 10% of our customers would come back for another purchase and it was hard to create this incentive. There were too many variables at play since the meals were not standardized and timings always varied. McDonald's is open to serve you when you want, with the things you are used to. A home cook might alter the menus or cook earlier/later in the day. This made it hard to keep customers coming back, even after we adjusted our protocols for cooks.  Regulation was always a dark cloud that hung above us. Even though we were operating in a grey area, the threats from the regulatory body were always there. When we went on the radio and received the email from Toronto Public Health, we knew we were in trouble. The email led to a call with the head of the organization and he mentioned two interesting things. He acknowledged the city did not have a way of monitoring all the food activity with the current base of food inspectors. And more importantly, that he didn’t want to make this call but had to because incumbents were calling him to say MealSurfers will destroy their business. As an entrepreneur, that felt really good. The result of this call was for the TPH to monitor us more closely than before, and that meant some more operational work for our team. We had monthly audits of our sales, customers, and anything related to our business. TPH would look at our insurance plans, and any documents we handed out relating to food. We even brought a knowledgeable food and safety operator on our team (shoutout Neil!), and we would still have to go through these audits. All of this was manageable, as I told myself any industry on the cusp of innovation has to go through this. At this time I found all of our local direct competitors (many who had sprung up since the interview) and tried to create a coalition of sorts to fight against these demands. Since we were the biggest in the space, and the only ones directly impacted, almost no one agreed to join forces just yet. Things got worse when two major events occurred. First, a competitor of ours in California was sent cease-and-desist letters, stopping them from operating. They went through petitions and even formed a bill to fight this problem. Secondly, since TPH had our cooks information, they reached out without our knowledge and threatened to close down their operations if they were not allowed to audit their homes. This sounds intense, and I am not sure it was legitimate, but the threat alone worked. Many cooks called in and suggested they were uncomfortable working with us as a result of these calls. Many of our best cooks stayed on board, but it was an issue we were not too pleased with tackling.  All of this could drive the team to be less committed. As a leader, I started to feel these events impacting my morale, and easily noticed the team being less involved. Momentum spirals both ways, either it's going up, or it's going down. If it starts to decrease, it is up to the leaders to change that, and I admit, I did not do a good job. Leaders should have a fine balance between vulnerability, and unwavering self-belief, and I don’t think I had the mix right. Ben Horowitz in the Hard Things about Hard Things talks about this and I highly recommend a read.  Knowing all this, it is easy to assume that anyone of these things killed the business. I would disagree. I think what killed the business was my inability to listen to the market and pivot. I was a stubborn kid, focused solely on our concept. These things killed our concept (home-cooked food delivery) but they shouldn’t have killed our business. During the half-life of our business companies like Platterz started up and I still feel we could have pivoted to that model had we taken a step back. In the Summer of 2015, all of these things had started to pile and I started to realize it might be best to think of shutting down. I emailed our cooks and let our team know that this is what I was thinking, and we started to think of creative ways to shut the business down. At first, I thought closing shop was the best thing ever, but I was convinced by our cooks that what we had built was sellable. I went to some venture capitalists, reached out to mentors, spoke to entrepreneurs I admired and started to put together a plan for exiting.  The exit plan was to do the following: Put together an asset list and attribute a monetary value to itIdentify companies that would be interested in the purchase and frame the acquisition to their benefitNever ask to sell, always ask to merge/ie work togetherInform the lawyers, cooks, and anyone in the network for help  As I started to prepare our decks and notify people, two interesting things happened. Firstly producers from the Food Network reached out and said they wanted to create a show based on our business. They would find three ethnic cooks, put them on our platform, promote the meals and the business in New York and see if it would take off. We would be paid $5000 per episode, if the pilot was successful. This seemed like a dream offer, but I ultimately turned it down after a series of meetings. The reasons were: A significant amount of time spent to make the pilot and modify the appOur team would not be featured on the show, and the website would rarely be featuredThe senior producers didn’t seem confident this was a good idea – I didn’t feel their energyAny merchandise, logo, brand, etc would be owned by the studio – the ultimate reason While this deal was souring, an investor reached out through one of our cooks asking to invest in the business. He said he had a bunch of ideas and wanted to bring on his own CTO to make this successful. I was very grateful and thought this is what I wanted. However, I looked at all the things happening in the business and I realized it would be better that I move on and start something else from scratch. He understood, but wouldn’t take no for an answer. He insisted on buying the business, and keeping me on as a consultant. He liked what we had done, we had gotten on well, and he believed in me. I took this information back to the team and they were thrilled at the result. Our core team would receive a soft landing for this business, and we could walk away with a nice profit. We weren’t millionaires, but it was an exit and a potential win at the time. We prepared the documents, negotiated terms and after some due diligence, finally signed. This process took around 2-3 months. I stayed on for 6 more months directing the business and then moved on. From what I understand the business now has reduced scope, and is no longer operating under MealSurfers. The reason I struggled so much with deciding if I should call this a failure was all to do with my personal perspective. You can sell a story anyway you want, but grounding yourself, in reality, is the most difficult thing to do. I find solace in knowing, however, that entrepreneurs never fail. We only learn. ‍ TLDR: Lack of recurring customers, regulation, lack of team dedication, my inability to understand the marketCreated an exit plan, turned down a television deal, almost raised more moneyEnded up being acquired and achieved a soft landing ‍", I mentioned much of this in the story so far so I’ll be brief: Personal: Not listening closely to the market – needing to pivot.Team: More dedication to the product.Market: Regulation & finding recurring customers  ,,,," Part of building the company involved understanding what are the reasons it could be shut down. I wanted to make sure I mitigated the major risks, before market testing. My conversations with Uber made me realize the importance of the law when dealing with on-demand business models. In every city, Uber was ruffling feathers and getting lawmakers to scratch their heads. The older generation didn’t trust Uber, but the forward-thinking millennials didn’t care. The model was working and the company had done lots of work on assessing appropriate drivers, protecting their liabilities, and marketing their business. Obviously I couldn’t copy everything they had done since we were in two different businesses, but their success was an inspiration. In my head, I was on the right path but I was proven wrong. To dive deep into food law, the first thing I did was speak to friends who owned or worked in the industry. I started to learn about various laws, inspections, audits, and policy-makers in charge of the industry. I spoke to many cooks and caterers, logging all of their feedback while pitching my idea. Many were enthusiastic, but uncertain about the rules and regulations I would face. Those that owned restaurants and catering businesses cautioned that I would be in trouble for starting this business. I couldn’t derive any real conclusions from these conversations. I had to go to the source of the truth. I found applicable food laws on the internet and started reading. I had never owned a restaurant, and never even thought about the laws surrounding this industry. It was not a fun read, but it taught me a lot. It was not enough to read just Ontario’s laws, I needed to read bills and laws in forward-thinking states like California and New York. I learned about home cooking bills that were submitted as a result of the recession, which were not acts in some parts of the United States. During the time these bills were being passed, Canada took a step backward and decided to limit what could be cooked and sold at home. I realized the business I would be starting could lead to a public debate. People had strong opinions on this, and if large states and countries were deciding how to regulate it, I knew I was playing with fire. To prepare myself I spoke to a number of lawyers who listed these bills and laws in their blogs. Any lawyer I came across in North America, I would give them a call, and schedule 30-minute meetings over lunch. I would have a disgusting burrito bowl in one hand, while arguing on the phone for a homemade marketplace in the other. I learned a lot from these conversations by trying to understand where the laws came from. I learned that none of these laws were airtight, and the city didn’t have the resources to defend them. I also learned there were lawyers very interested in my idea, and desperately wanted to see it succeed. The best advice, however, was to get insurance. I recall how long it took Uber and Airbnb to find the right insurance partners, and I knew this was going to be a struggle. I shopped around and spoke to a few different companies but was unsuccessful. It was not until one of my lawyer friends introduced me to a small insurance company, that I caught my lucky break. Together we discussed the business, the legal structure, and obtained a two million dollar liability insurance, which we thankfully never needed. Again, I learned so much from all of these conversations. Food companies need insurance from all sorts of things! It is really interesting to see what makes the world tick when you look under the hood. Now that I had the laws and insurance checked out, I needed to know if this really was a business I could work on. I had been looking at competitors and the market, but I wanted to dive deep. I got in touch with every single competitor who would speak to me and asked them how they got started. To some, I would lie and say I am a student learning about the business. To others, I was honest and told them exactly what I would do. Speaking to my competitors was an obvious move, but it still surprises me how many young entrepreneurs I speak to that neglect doing this. There is a risk you obtain no information, but then you don’t really lose anything. However, you could obtain great feedback and an even better understanding of what you are about to commit to. I spoke to over a dozen competitors from around the world and learned about their challenges with regulation, the business model failures, and general small business qualms. Some competitors offered to be a mentor, others told me I would fail. The conclusions I drew from these conversations, however, made two things clear. One, that no one had won in the market, and yet everyone loved the insight. To me, that meant it’s anyone’s game, and you just have to play your best to see where it goes. Those are the best games. There’s no Goliath. No heavy hitters. You’re not playing the house, you’re playing each other and the outcome could be very lucrative. Secondly, none of these competitors knew what they were doing. We were all up against laws and trends that were constantly changing. We were playing in an evolving industry and there were no right answers. We’re playing poker blind with equally shitty cards, yet somehow everyone believed they could win. Welcome to entrepreneurship. Or so I thought.  Alongside my direct competitors, there were companies that were trying to solve the same problem as us. These were food delivery companies like Foodora and Uber Eats, along with pre-made boxes such as Chowdy. I decided to speak to each of these and learn what they did to start their companies, and how their business models worked. This was incredibly helpful as it allowed me to see how we could be different, and also gave me an idea of the price point that made sense. My chat with Foodora’s MD was incredibly helpful, as it showed me the costs of running a delivery startup, and how their unit economics could only work at scale and with top-end brands. This left a huge room for the long tail - which was my target audience. The question that remained was whether or not I could convince people to buy these products and that led me to start market testing. Up to this point, I had spent around 2-3 months doing this research, while working full time. I had no website, and a few friends interested in helping me out. I tapped two of those friends, Halima and Alan, and asked them to make some food for me that I would sell and deliver on their behalf. They agreed. I asked them to make the food and let me try it (free food!) and I took pictures that were used to create flyers. I posted these flyers in the lobbies, gyms, and community centers near where Alan and Halima lived. Since it was downtown Toronto, the population density was high enough that I thought I could obtain enough traffic. I added my mobile number for people who were interested in buying the meals, and did not source Alan or Halima specifically in the ads. Luckily, people started calling. At first we offered only 3 meals per cook, but within a few days, we had to ramp that up to 10. Halima and Alan were starting to sell out, and they wanted to experiment with other meals. Simultaneously, I would interview strangers walking around downtown about my idea. I would take some work from home days or spend evenings talking to people and seeing if this opportunity had potential. A combination of these things made me overlook the fact that most people buying from Alan and Halima were people that already had an idea of this concept, and were just buying this on a trial basis. These sales were false positives, and I should have spent longer here studying the market. Since I thought the market was telling me it is time to grow this, I tapped one of the hackers - Justin - at my breakfast event to build a website. I had already built the preliminary website called ‘foodali’ at the time, but it was not good enough. Justin saw my progress and we had worked together on something in university. He trusted me and I think that is why he joined. I guess he also liked free food tastings and the idea that this was part mission-driven. It’s important to note that while I had done a significant amount of legwork, I kept him and anyone else I wanted to work within the loop. It added to my credibility, but also it kept me accountable. In some ways, I always knew I’d work with Justin, Halima and Alan, and I just needed to create a reason. This was the point where I thought I could start looking for cooks outside of Halima and Alan. I thought this would be difficult, however I was wrong. Craigslist had tonnes of postings and I was able to contact many of the cooks and they were interested. I had to convince some that this was a website and platform for them to sell, while others got the idea right away. Before onboarding them, I needed to make sure they were safe, and that I could trust them. This is where free food tests came in. I printed out the food preparation checklist from the government website, and studied it. Some of the items were outdated, and I knew if I asked cooks to let me inspect their homes with a printout, they would be curious. I had to create more legitimacy and this is when I decided to get a lawyer on board. The lawyer would help me draft documents that I could use to prove what we were doing was not illegal, and update the checklist, such that it was relevant. The biggest benefit of doing this, along with having a website, was that it gave us more credibility in the market. We posted these documents on the website for anyone to read. At this time Justin was also wondering if we needed a designer to make the website more appealing. I had worked with Etan during an internship at BNOTIONS before joining RBC and I thought he would be a perfect fit. I reached out to him at the time, and he agreed this would be something exciting for him to work on. ‍ ‍ When the team of three was formed, the website and documents were ready, I set out to call, visit, and acquire cooks. It was a brutal effort, travelling around the city to find cooks, only to realize that sometimes they were not interested. I visited parts of the city I had never known, and met people I would have never come across. It made me appreciate the diversity that exists in this great city. It’s worth noting the goal of this business was not to try and check every meal eventually. Airbnb staff don’t visit every house, and Uber doesn’t check every cab. I knew if this was going to scale, I would have to stop these checks eventually, but as Paul Graham says, do things that don’t scale. ‍ ‍TLDR: Studied the regulations, identified gaps, obtained insurance, spoke to competitors.Started with flyers in buildings and two friends who were cooks, spent time interviewing people and being customer-focusedGot cofounder for a website, found cooks on craigslist and community centersCreated a food inspection checklist with a lawyer, checked every home for safe cooking  ",," My thoughts on the topic of exchanging food didn’t start until I was feeling antsy at work. I liked my job at RBC. I had great colleagues and a really cool boss, but I just felt I was making no impact. I was itching to do something and had dozens of ideas I was testing. I would spend Monday mornings chatting with airtime providers in East Africa to test a remittance idea. Create UI mockups of an app connecting professionals and ex-pats in a city. I even spent three months trying to sell portable mobile phone chargers to various concert venues with a friend. Most of these ideas went nowhere. Sometimes there would be some traction, or an introduction to someone doing the same thing, but ultimately it led nowhere. My frustrations were mounting. Simultaneously I started to notice myself gain weight and realize how hard it is to find a healthy meal for a good price in downtown Toronto. There was a third factor that really helped me push forward. While I may seem self-motivated, I needed something to keep me in check. I started a group called “Breakfast for Hackers” in Toronto. We would meet on the weekends and discuss various ideas. We probably had 10 meetings with all sorts of people trying to work on different ideas either looking for a brainstorming session, or feedback. It was fun, but people didn’t seem as interested after some time, and the meetings weren’t always well planned (my fault). The group disseminated but I kept in touch with everyone, pitching ideas constantly and obtaining some support. What happened early in 2015 is a combination of these things. The frustrations at work, the need for a healthier diet, and the hackers I met, all came together. I started to identify the problem I wanted to solve was health-related. I wanted a better diet at a price that made sense. My hacker friends felt the same way, and they pointed to solutions in the market which I thought were incredibly faulty. I was not happy with pre-made box meals. I didn’t want to, nor had the time to make food. And I was not going to ride on the soylent wave because it didn’t feel natural. There had to be another way that fit my diet and my budget. These frustrations continued to mount, and I kept asking myself ‘how can I eat better?’ At some point, the idea for MealSurfers was born. I don’t know if I had the idea swirling in my head, or if I had noticed and remembered certain situations from the past. Two things are for certain one, my mother used to make lots of meals for people in our community and we would exchange food constantly. Some of my best dinners growing up were made by friends or colleagues of my parents. If I really liked the dish, my mom would find the recipe and try to make the food herself. Her versions of the meal were never the same. Two, in my religion, the tradition of exchanging food has been around for centuries. It is likely that this was brought into practice to help the poor and build a community. The tradition exists today, and is sometimes the main reason why hungry university students come to our mosque. Noticing these two events in my life, I thought there was a potential for exchanging home-cooked meals on a large scale. It also helped that I was following Uber’s success very closely. I was very fortunate to work with some of the senior members on Uber’s team as they were doing a deal with RBC. Before the partnership, it was my job to do some due diligence, and make sure they were a good partner. I learned what I could about their model, and realized it could be applied to multiple markets. I probably didn’t realize it then, but I wasn’t betting on the technology, I was betting on people. I was betting that people would be more trusting of each other. I don’t think I was wrong, but my vision was definitely tainted. ‍ When I had a reasonably good idea of the business I wanted to test, I asked my hacker friends for their thoughts. In fact, I asked many friends for their thoughts. There was lots of criticism, sometimes disguised as doubt. I had pitched so many ideas, that no one believed I was actually going to start something. In some ways, the advice given was never really thought through. I guess that’s what I deserve for being the boy who cried startup! There were some friends who really did believe in the idea. They weren’t willing to jump on board just yet, but they were keen on seeing how things progressed. At such early stages, it’s hard to decipher the friends who are just interested, and the ones who really want to get on board. Many people will go so far as rolling up their sleeves, but only if their schedule permits. As someone diving headfirst into the idea, I was unaware that the team I started practice with, was not going to be the team I played the game with. This is a really important point because team is probably the number one thing that can make or break a company. When you read advice like this, it’s easy to brush over it. Any project I work on now, I make sure I get along with the team, that the group is motivated to succeed, and we all compliment each other’s skill set. I cannot emphasize how important this is. ‍ As I started to learn these lessons, I grew more confident in my idea. I knew I needed to do three things now. I needed to assess the regulatory framework in the food space, primarily in Ontario. I needed to check the competition, and create a solid business case for doing this. And I needed to run a basic test to see how people would feel about this product. ‍ TLDR: Friends, trends of unhealthy foods, no real competition, traditions in my family and the love of a good meal."," If I could go back in time and tell the 23-year-old me anything, it would be to be more analytical and be flexible with the model. I would tell myself to really listen to the market, and not be so adamant about proving a point around the sharing economy model. Usually, the best opportunities are just a short shift in trajectory away. We could have easily built companies like Platterz or Cloud Kitchens had we focused on these pivots. Besides that, I think everything I did was a huge lesson. Surrounding myself with smart, hungry (no pun intended) people, was very useful in convincing me that I could do it. Quitting my job and going in full time was the best decision I ever made. Doing the interview, gathering feedback, and marketing the product in the many ways we did was a huge lesson. These learnings were invaluable in my roles following, and also taught me so much about myself. I think you’re truly not learning until you’ve pushed yourself to the extent of your abilities. That’s where the greatest learnings are. Eventually I will start over, and work on a different business that is 1000x better than MealSurfers in every way. I have worked on a number of ideas since, but I am waiting to see what would take off. Also, you always learn more from what didn’t work than what did. This way I have far greater clarity and purpose going forward.  ‍ TLDR: Be more analytical and flexible, pivot fasterBe grateful ‍"," Our business was two-sided, so growth relied on obtaining cooks and customers. I thought obtaining customers would be easy, but it was the cooks that were far easier. Posting in community centers, online websites, putting up blogs, and word of mouth got us dozens of sign-ups. People were signing up so fast, we needed to create a better way of tracking signups. We also needed to ask more questions on our form and as a result there were knowledge gaps across different people that had signed up. To obtain customers, we tried a few things, but we also got really lucky. I quit my job in September to go full time on this, after working on the side for about 5 months. Etan and Justin joined me and we would work out of coffee shops and each other’s homes until November, when we were accepted into one of Toronto’s top accelerators - the Ryerson Digital Media Zone - the DMZ . The incubator gave us some office space, publicity, a strong network, and also earned us a mentor who offered us a chance to do an interview with CBC Radio. My gut told me not to do the interview, because we weren’t ready for the fanfare. The media was riding on the Uber wave, and the tide was high. Our website and team were not ready to experience the high volumes. I checked with the team and they said we should get publicity, and I could tell that after two months of doing coffee shop work and not seeing significant profits, they needed an uplift. I agreed to do the interview on a Tuesday morning at the CBC studio - big mistake. The interview started at 7 am, and by 7:45 am our website had crashed twice. It’s safe to say the interview went well, and we had thousands of people sign up to either cook for us, or join our newsletter. We had lots of feedback and people willing to work for us to make this thing grow. All of this happened from one radio interview at 7 am. Unbelievable. In the following days, Justin, Etan, I and a new team member named Shub worked very hard to make sure we were responsive and ready for the additional traffic. The radio interview also got interested press from local newspapers to contact us for further interviews. Within the week, we were featured on Fast Company, two online blogs, and front page of the Toronto Metro. Even though we were not financially successful, it felt like we were kings. Press and false status are killers. I started to feel less humble about my work, and started to overlook potential problems, assuming everything would be fine. My parents took extra copies of the newspaper, I was stopped a few times by people on the street, and I had old employers and classmates reaching out to congratulate me. I even started dating a girl outside my league! I let it get to my head. The biggest problem, however, was not the way I started to see myself or the business, it was the negative feedback I was receiving. Specifically, it was an email from Toronto Public Health about our operations. I knew this day would come and I was prepared for it, but there were still many surprises. Before I go into the email and how it eventually led to one of the big reasons why the business didn’t work, it’s worth mentioning other things we tried in the realm of marketing. We spent a lot of time using Facebook and Reddit ads, and we still posted flyers and sent postcards to local neighbourhoods. This form of advertising had limited reach - somewhere in the area of 5-10% uptake. Looking back, however, we should have focused on niche areas where restaurants were not supplying the right products. This means areas where there were more vegan needs, or places that had higher halal food expectations. If there was a way to plot this on a map (Google restaurant API, cross-referenced with blogTO or other social data about the neighbourhood) we could have targeted better. Hindsight 2020. We also tried refer a friend, community events, tasters, mixers, partnering with grocery stores and Yelp but ultimately all of those areas were either break even or loss-making. The newsletter + organic social media approach was really helpful. Since this idea had a really strong communal element to it, it made sense that these mediums worked well. I am really grateful we brought on Vanessa , who was helping out at the DMZ at the time to show us what we needed to do in these areas to succeed. ‍ ‍ Overall it was fun bringing people together but very few ended up becoming initial and even more so recurring customers. We raised awareness and many people knew what we were up to, so from a growth and consumer business standpoints we were a success. However not enough people were trying our products or coming back. We had educated the market, but the crux of product-market fit remained elusive. Businesses like this really thrive on a local, word of mouth approach. Creating small groups and managing growth in specific areas should have been the way to go.   TLDR: Incubator helped us out, also using social media and the obvious online tools.Radio interview put us on the map.Tried many marketing avenues, but struggled.", You can check out our podcasts here and here.

When we started, I put in the initial $5000 for expenses like adverts, domains, packaging, transportation and such. When my co-founders came on, I didn’t pay them anything but gave them a large amount of equity as compensation. This showcases two major mistakes - one not thinking I had what it takes to raise the initial amount of money and two, compensating co-founders with large amounts of equity. Luckily the business didn’t last long enough for this to be problematic.  That initial $5k took us to about 6 months, and by that time we already had some revenue. In fact, as early as the third month, we were averaging 40 meals a month, so probably something like $400. We started by taking a 10% cut, but eventually moved this number around until we thought we had it right (but never really got there). I never had to put more money in as our revenue covered the costs, and we started generating a very small profit later in our business. Our expenses were minimal since we had free office space, weren’t paying ourselves, almost zero overhead. This was not sustainable obviously. At our peak, we were probably averaging $7,000 in revenue through selling meals and catering. Catering brought the bulk of the money - I think we could have easily gotten 60% of our revenue this way, while meals took care of the rest. Catering was not a formal product - it was a ‘sophisticated’ google sheet that I had to convince my own network and extended network to buy from us. Catering itself is a complex market, where most cooks that worked for us, already catered on the side. This meant we would need to either target opportunities like lunch catering where they weren’t successful or obtain a lower fee to avoid people cutting us out of a deal. We had no real website, no app, nothing focused on this catering market, but it started driving a lot of our demand. The problem with catering was it would tap out eventually - since a cook could only make so much fresh food, and if we’re using multiple cooks, we get into logistical problems. This meant we’d need to unlock more catering capacity by renting a kitchen or having faster deliveries. Around April 2016 we started facing the regulation issue and the catering thing was put on hold. Had I raised money, I could have paid attention to both avenues but I had only one engineer and I needed to focus on maximizing operations. This was when revenue started to decline and the prospect of shutting down or selling became more apparent. Right before selling, I think we ended up with around $1000 a month in revenue, which was a large drop. Luckily we didn’t lose money in this experience as the exit not only covered our cost but pro rata probably earned us what we would have earned had we kept working that year, and then some. ‍ TLDR: Started with $5k, peak revenue was $7k a monthExited for a profit ‍",Food & Beverage,,Canada,"November 4, 2019",Ali Jiwani,https://www.failory.com/interview/mealsurfers,"['https://anchor.fm/jiwani', 'https://anchor.fm/fim', 'https://medium.com/@alijiwani1/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-jiwani-8213a319/']",success,1,$0-$10k/mo,"Ali started MealSurfers when he was 23 years old.

144,melon," Hi, I'm Kevin Wang! I've been based in Atlanta for the past 6 years after starting my undergrad at Georgia Tech. I was the founder and CEO of Melon, a food delivery startup aimed at being more efficient and cost effective for users and restaurants alike. Our model was focused on streamlining the process by offering the most popular items and most popular times, allowing us to pool many orders at once, reducing time taken during trips to drop off items. Here's how it worked. Each week, we would create a unique, curated menu of the best local restaurants and their popular items that would last well for delivery. Our lunch drop off was between 12-12:30, dinner between 6:30-7. Users would pre-order before 11am, and 5pm for lunch and dinner, respectively, and all orders would be picked up and dropped off in the shortest trip possible. This enabled us to pool many more orders than would be possible compared to on demand. Our business model was dependent on restaurant commissions. We could charge zero delivery fees because pooling 10+ items at once with one driver would pay for the driving time with just 10% of the total order cost.. Food delivery uniquely has three segments to balance: the customer, restaurant, and driver. Here are their respective benefits under this model. As we expanded, we had to get creative to effectively deliver many items within a short time frame. We adopted a sort of miniature warehouse distribution style, where a car (like a truck on the highway) would pick up 50-60 items from the restaurant further out, and meet with other cars at a common point (the warehouse) to pass off 10-15 items each for them to make short stops downtown and around campus. This allowed us to achieve a high capacity of items delivered in a short timeframe with fewer miles driven, benefitting consumer price-point as well as environmental impact. My vision for the company expanded far beyond this concept, into a service that would involve collaboration between users and local businesses to further improve efficiency, reduce costs, and allow small businesses to thrive using a delivery supply chain that truly worked for them. To users, we would be the one-stop-shop marketplace for your local favorites (food, crafts, groceries), with the best prices. Our team was small, but close, with my brother Jeff, and a good friend Jack Olinde, and we were all technical founders. I led our business development, customer discovery, as well as technical aspects like design and software development. We all wore many hats. My day-to-day varied widely from fixing bugs and implementing new features to onboarding restaurants and collaborating with other entrepreneurs, but I tried to keep a main focus each day to reduce time lost from context switching. Now that Melon is shut down and school is closed, I am actively looking for roles related with software engineering, data science, and machine learning. ‍"," We had limited overhead costs especially as we did most of the driving. Any extra efforts we would spend on came from margins that came from previous deliveries. We started to raise a pre-seed of $275k, and preparing for that was part of the research where we saw a lack of a strong path forward. To grow faster, we wanted to raise money to improve our application, hire drivers, add more restaurants, and expand our drop off locations. We started to prepare decks and pitches for angels and early stage ventures, with a focus on landing a few of the former. The logistics, process, and hypothesized benefits of our service realized new metrics that were off base from what we initially predicted. At the core of what we wanted to accomplish was a business model that could be successful at the smaller scale without need for heavy investments and subsidized orders. With more users, our consistency and reliability decreased, so efficiencies were not as prominent as forecasted. The wages required for the drivers was also higher than initially planned, since the work was harder and more involved than delivering 1-2 orders at a time. Rapid stops, managing food, and constant communication equaled more effort so higher wages. We initially estimated around 15% in margins over 150k MRR after paying the restaurant and drivers. However, after looking at the data for the time we delivered and adjusting our assumptions, in a best case scenario, the payout after restaurants and drivers would be near zero. We were also rolling out features and experiments slower, with more time spent managing the existing service. Our path to profitability at scale was looking similar to those of existing on demand food delivery companies. It was necessary to find a fundamental shift or strategy in what we were doing. Expanding to $150k MRR across the state and other cities would require much more overhead with software, support, and marketing. We decided to discontinue for these reasons as our burn rate would just be too high, even with low wages. Sure there was still a sliver of chance with slower growth or finding a new niche, but we did not set out to create just “another” food delivery startup. I still believe this was the right choice - I just don't think we would have been able to continue to outcompete if we expanded more. ‍  Pooling orders is not a unique concept. All the companies are trying approaches, and there are many promising startups as well, like Peach, Foodsby, and GoodUncle. UberEats tested out a concept of picking up many orders at once and distributing them over time, but discontinued that. Postmates Party has picked up traction and improved. Moreover, many ideas to further separate ourselves were being rolled out, like focusing on even more local businesses and grocers. And I can't avoid saying that lack of experience was a major factor. We had to spend so much time learning technologies, the industry, and we were not quick enough to iterate with new concepts. It was pretty strange to realize and make the decision to shut down, since I had spent so much time building just for the next week and hadn't taken as much time to reflect on the business as a whole, just different experiments within our local optimum. ‍",,,,," Our MVP was as simple as it gets: a group chat where we would broadcast a menu of 2-3 items from a popular restaurant, with specific drop off times and locations. Our target market was students at dense locations on campus. We spammed existing group chats and added friends to find users. The goal of this was to answer a few questions: did people have similar problems with food delivery as I had? Does a cheaper price make the limited selection and drop offs worth it? Will the routing times actually pan out accurately to be more profitable then existing services? What simple gamification scenarios might work (ex. Order even earlier for a discount. Have product scarcity to encourage quick decisions). We found relative success with this, notably 17 items dropped off within 45 minutes for our best delivery. Our solution to their pain-points was immediately recognized. We even made just a bit of money through ordering catered prices and selling at menu price, despite no delivery fee. Jack and I did the driving ourselves. This only went on for one week, then COVID hit, and all students were sent home off campus. But we took this validation, and prepared for a real product launch. We had to shift away from campus and downtown to apartments instead. We launched a website to sign up and subscribe to menus, which consisted of automated daily text messages. ‍ First Launch and Obstacles We didn't gain the traction we wanted during this new launch, which happened in June. We again used Reddit, group chats, and experimented with Facebook and Google ads. Our previous target customer, students, were not around, so we tried to focus on acquiring customers at apartment buildings by approaching apartment office leadership. Growth was slow, and towards the end of the summer, we had 75 subscribed customers, and while we were able to achieve occasional bulk drop-offs and successful trips, it was clearly not sustainable. I still believed that with the return of students, we would find greater demand, so instead of trying to accelerate growth over the summer, we spent time learning the logistics, some customer behavior, and built an online ordering + tracking system. ‍ Relaunch With students returning in August, we relaunched with a streamlined website ordering and checkout process, as well as implemented card payments. It was (almost) like a real food delivery product! During this, our customer base rapidly grew, so we started to expand restaurant selections, utilize route optimization, and experimented with different features and pricing strategies. We wanted to validate that our service could be profitable down the line, so we maintained a balance between trying to obtain margins on deliveries, acquiring, and retaining customers. One extraordinary benefit of this model is that as orders increase for one trip, the average time between stops decreases, as they are more likely to either be at the same location or closer to each other. For example, within a 1 mile radius, dropping 10 items off might take 25 minutes over 5 stops, but 20 items could take 35 minutes over 8 stops. ‍ Notable achievements $10k MRR at time of shut down (commissions and fees averaged 13% of this)500 usersOver 15 items per trip on averageLess than 30 minute average drop off timeBest quantity: 47 items for one mealBest profit: $420 payed by customers for a $350 meal at bulk price, over a 45 minute drop off timeThousands in fees saved from customers, in additional payout to restaurants, and driven miles reduced as compared to if the orders were fulfilled on-demandAccomplished largely from August 2020 to October 2020, doing our own driving, and just 2 meals/drop off times for weekdays! ‍ Hacks Very first payment was only from Venmo/PayPal. We would send payment requests after dropping off. Fortunately, and miraculously, nobody ghosted us!We initially created routes manually and sent our Twilio texts manually (from a basic web app) like a dispatcher for order updates. We had routing and estimation implemented just before this became too overwhelmingTo roll out website ordering with limited front-end experience, we leveraged Webflow to create our UI. Their e-Commerce did not meet the functionality we needed, and they only had a back-end API, but we still used some of their item creation and display, so we glued together DOM manipulations as well as our backend API to create our ordering and checkout process. ‍"," Our growth was mostly organic. We had a focus to provide excellent service and obsession with ensuring that our customers would receive the best product of food quality and variety. We made it clear that we're doing our best to support small businesses. An additional behavior we did not expect was the desire for shared experiences, especially during the pandemic. We were uniquely positioned to offer high quality meals to friends apart from each other, enjoyed right at the same time. This was a key to having our service appreciated by users and shared with friends. And when nearby friends ordered together, this further improved our drop off efficiency. It was important to continue to expand the number of restaurants we offered and keep the options diverse. This involved a balance between exploring new options, and still offering the high demand items. Our most effective outreach to new customers was posting a friendly version of our menu to social media."," After graduating in 2018, I worked as a software engineer working on a mix of full stack development and signal processing. I also pursued a Masters in Computer Science with a focus on machine learning, which I just graduated from this Dec 2020! Late 2019, early 2020, I was at a sort of crossroads of what I wanted to do - I was actually early in the job search stage when I shifted focus fully on this startup. Melon's approach to food delivery was inspired by problems I, a frugal student, personally faced as a user like cost, reliability, and simplicity. Existing companies were trying to reduce costs by combining orders to shorten the number of trips, but only one to two drop offs at a time. What logistics changes could enable food delivery with 20+ items dropped off together? Would there be consumer demand of more people like me for such a product given the additional constraints that would arise? Tackling this problem appealed to me partly based on my past experience with startups. Atlanta and especially Georgia Tech has a deep startup and entrepreneurial culture, so I was exposed to many companies, industries, and founders. I had worked at a startup with high technical risk- meaning rolling out the product required technical innovations. However, testing out a food delivery concept has limited technical risk and financial risk. Entering the market and making progress is influenced more by business development and validating concepts with quick iterations, rather than having complicated software, and this new challenge interested me."," Start with an even smaller target market and specific niche. We tried to do too much at once, instead of isolating concepts and fully learning about the implications. This resulted in us touching upon a lot of interesting concepts, but without any real knowledge or conclusions, including but not limited to the following: How much value does reduced time in pre-ordering offer, and how many will plan ahead? If orders are in 1 day vs 6 hours vs 1 hour early, what does that mean for the user and restaurant?Can we further limit drop off locations? What threshold resembles the best balance between market size and trip efficiency?How many extra, unordered meals can we carry? What are the indicators to predict how many people might order if we say ""I'm at location X with sandwich Y, want it""?Would a subscription like MealPal work for these kinds of deliveries?How might a loss leader come into play? For example, if we offered a popular sandwich at a loss, would people add on a pricier desert?Okay... is ""local"" really that important? Form more intimate relationships with restaurants, and have a restaurant expert on our team. I felt like a salesman much of the time. We should have pursued a journey along with them, rather than just have them as a product. Seek out failure, that's when you know you're pushing a boundary and will learn the most. Doing what's safe and enjoyed by many will just keep you comfortable in a local optimum. I wish more kitchens turned me away, so I could have found what fewer owners absolutely LOVE, and commit to, to grow concentrically from there. That goes for users too. Target more specific ethnic cuisines, groups, locations, and restaurants. A good foothold on a section of international students would have enabled us to have more sustained demand for a cuisine further away that is not as accessible to them. In terms of preparing food, much of Asian cuisine shines under bulk preparation as it can be made together, and its quality holds after time. However, something like sandwiches is not as effective, because the preparation effort scales linearly. Team expertise. While I absolutely loved working with my team, we didn't necessarily complement each other's weaknesses or strengths. While we were all smart, and hardworking, most time was spent learning frameworks instead of focusing on the customer product. ‍",," If you are interested in hearing more of my specific approaches and comments, please refer to this post I wrote on Medium.

145,mentorcruise," Hey, thanks for having me! I’m the Founder of MentorCruise.com, a mentorship service for people in tech. I’m 23 years old, living in Zurich, Switzerland. I launched MentorCruise when I was only 20 years old, working on it during an incredibly long commute that I had. The idea behind MentorCruise is simple: To reach their goals, people need support and accountability. Both can be provided by a mentor. However, good mentors are sparse, and getting someone to formally engage with you in a mentor-mentee relationship almost always only happens in schools and organized work relationships. So that’s where we swoop in – we have around 500 mentors on file with what they are happy to provide for mentees, and how much it’s going to cost them. Other than other services, we don’t rely on sessions, paid calls, or by-the-minute billing to do so – you sign up with a flat monthly fee and have access to your mentor when you need it. We take a cut. As a solo founder, I have my hands full with all areas of the business. Today, I have two part-time helpers in customer support and development, but there is still a lot to do when it comes to product, growth, marketing, and community support. ‍",," We talked about the overblown MVP. That’s one of the things that bugs me a lot still since it didn’t only cost me those 4-5 months it took to initially build it, but also months of work to get to a common ground again (and removing a lot of the features in the process). I also mentioned that our first paying customer brought us about $5 in commission. We were simply scared to charge enough: We were charging on a weekly basis, which made people anxious and didn’t provide a lot of security for usWe only took 10% as a commission when some of our competitors took up to 30%We didn’t give people any kind of suggestions on what they should charge. After taking care of that and switching the business model around, we started growing a lot quicker. I could count a lot more things, but it comes down to one thing – I was scared to take risks. When I had my $100 in MRR, I didn’t want to switch things up because I thought I’d lose it. When I was at $500 in MRR, I thought that the business works as-is. But the point is, you can’t assume that whatever got you to $500 in MRR will also get you to $5,000 in MRR. You need to take risks and it’s easy to do so the smaller your business still is. ",," In 2020, MentorCruise has experienced its greatest year to date. We’ve grown from about $700 in MRR to around $4,600 by the end of 2020. Since then, we’ve already doubled again and are sitting at $7,800 in revenue. One question that often comes up is whether that’s all we make or just our cut. When we talk about revenue, we only talk about our cut. The volume of the whole marketplace currently sits at around $40,000 per month. It’s crazy! We grow at a healthy rate, roughly 10% month-over-month. Our profits before hiring are very healthy – we pretty much just pay $15 per month to Postmark, $49 per month to Tapfilliate, and $20 per month in hosting. Most of the rest goes out to hiring – we work with Embarque for our content and as I already mentioned, we have two amazing part-time people in support and engineering. I hope that we can keep up the growth in this sustainable way for the near future. It would mean that we’d sit at over $16k in MRR by the end of the year. Enough for me to comfortably work full-time on the business and also hire one or two helpers additionally. To achieve this, we can’t sit still though. Currently, I’m focusing a lot of energy on making sure that mentors can perform at their best. Since last month, mentor profiles look drastically different, for example.",," As a first-time founder, this was incredibly painful. Today, I know all about how you should validate an idea first, talk to customers, build an MVP, seek further validation and then think about a proper product. Back then, I had no idea! I had never heard of sites like ProductHunt or IndieHackers. So, I took the tools that I already had in my belt (being able to code stuff in Python and write some crude HTML/CSS) and started building. First a landing page, then the full product. ‍ If I look back to this, I made a ton of mistakes: instead of letting my early potential users dictate my scope, I thought of all the cool features I could add during my commute. Instead of validating the business and asking potential mentors and mentees what they’d look for, I did it all in my head. Honestly, thinking back to it this would’ve been destined to fail. What I ended up with was an overblown MVP scope. The site had to have a scheduling feature to schedule meetings, right? And the chat solutions that were out there were too expensive, gotta build my own. Let’s add a to-do list function, a way to send sample projects to each other, and what about a community? Let’s add that one too. If there is one thing that I did right, it was talking to people every day. In my head, making this work relied on having good mentors on the page, so I DMed and emailed people every day, asking them to become part of it. The MVP took me around 4-5 months to build, which is a stupidly long time and mainly caused by the huge scope. When I was ready to launch, over 100 people were interested to become mentors, many of which had 10,000s of followers on Twitter. The strategy was clear: They’d all sign up, share their profile and all their followers would come streaming in. Well, that didn’t happen of course. Out of the 100 interested people, around 10 ended up signing up, and maybe one or two of them ended up sharing their profiles elsewhere. Now, the work began. ‍",," Before building MentorCruise, I was engaged in various forms of online education, such as MOOCs. Out of all these courses and schemes, it was the ones that offered 1-on-1 mentorship that had the most impact on me. However, these mentorship programs were mostly side-projects of these companies. The core was always the coursework. Once you didn’t do the coursework anymore, you’d also lose access to your mentor. Even more crucially: When you’re done with your course, when the crucial time of job-hunting and interviewing starts, your mentor is gone. As a career starter at 19 years old, I experienced this first-hand and found that many of my peers experienced this too. Many of us also were on both sides of the market – looking for a mentor and also mentoring students ourselves, so I decided to initially just create a little index of all of us. That’s how we got our first dozen users or so – I ended up talking to around 100 potential mentors before launching something and a few of them came from those learning communities. I had many attempts to build a business or to come up with a nice business idea I could work on, but this one was the first one that clicked and then also ended up making real revenue."," That’s a hard question. Truth is, I had no idea how to build a business at the start of this. Since then, I have had time to reflect on a lot of early decisions I made during building MentorCruise, but there are new things I learn every day. I am fortunate that I can reflect on a lot of questions again when I mentor others. The first step in building a business is always to seek validation. Do not start on the solution before you get to know 10 people that would pay to get a problem solved.Your MVP scope should be as small as possible. If you can earn some money without building a product at first, you might have a winner on your hands.As important as your idea is your growth channel. If you have no idea how to grow a product, do not start it.Listen to your users, but don’t do everything they say. It’s easy to fall into panic if someone reports a bug or has a feature request. You need to prioritize though. "," I undersold my little “influencer technique”. Adding these known faces as mentors did have some impact. The first ever paid customer joined the site around 2-3 weeks after launch. I saw the application come in, saw the mentor accept it, saw the mentee set up their payment, and boom – I got my first $5 or so (I had a very unattractive commission scheme back then). Turns out, their mentor profile got indexed by Google and when they were researching about this known developer figure, they found the offering and took the chance. So, I’d say this was probably how we got our first 10 paying customers. I ended up spending an hour or two per day just getting new mentors to sign up. Over time, the team grew from 10 mentors to 20, then 30, then 50. Most of them were able to get someone on their network to sign up with them. Later, I recognized how powerful search was for this. I ended up creating a lot of different landing pages that today dominate the first page of Google. I invested a lot into our blog, becoming a welcome resource for career changers. Whenever someone complains online about not being able to find a mentor, we are there too. However, this took years to pay off. But in the end, it’s all about the service. The fact that existing mentors tell their coworkers and friends. The fact that mentees write about us and tell their friends. It’s a nice network effect where every new mentor usually also attracts other mentees and mentors. Today, we do a lot to sustain our growth and momentum. We have a new affiliate program, we run a referral scheme for mentors, we do paid ads, we ask mentors to share more, we have a community blog and incentivize mentors to do well. ‍"," I tend to share more about my work on my Twitter. If you are a fellow founder, also check out my Substack on building an online marketplace, I am sure it can help you. If you’d like to become a mentor, please apply! People love being a mentor on MentorCruise. You’ll become part of our community, a tightly knit network of people all around the tech industry. From FAANG veterans to YC founders, we have them all! And finally, if you are in the trenches trying to find a new job, leveling up in your career, or finally building that business of yours, consider getting a mentor."," Built to Sell by John Warrillow is one of the books that changed my thinking about building a business the most. I think it’s a good guide for entrepreneurs that are deeply personally connected with their business. It has also taught me a lot when it comes to hiring people, spending money, or automating a certain task. It’s probably the reason why, as a founder, I can still take a week away from work without stuff going up in flames. Not many can say that about themselves. It puts me at an advantage because I could run this business forever without burning out. I am not a big fan of online communities. Many of them got overly business-ized and don’t provide a ton of value. Throwing a bunch of people in a Slack channel, that’s no community. That’s why I love Founder Summit. I think they are an incredibly smart bunch of people and the only community I check regularly. Then, the classics – IndieHackers, ProductHunt, Reddit. All good places to talk to new people. And, my love-hate relationship with Facebook Groups. I hate Facebook, love the groups. They are a huge ecosystem in themselves and often include a lot of people with no other social media.

146,metricspot," I’m a weird kind of tech entrepreneur. I studied architecture (yes, the buildings type...) but long before finishing my degree I knew I would end up having my own business. I’m currently 36 years old and although I’m currently based in Madrid, where I grew up, I’ve been traveling and working remotely on my company, MetricSpot, for the past few years. I founded MetricSpot in 2013 with the vision of being the first SEO Tool Kit in the Spanish and Latam markets. We’re a SaaS company with a freemium model and currently, we have over 45.000 registered users worldwide. ‍",," The biggest challenges I faced during this time were personal. When I started the project, I was in a relationship that was coming to an end. Plus, I was almost broke because I had previously started another company and it didn’t go well. So, when I found myself facing a break-up and moving back to my parents’ place and going back to the dreaded 9-to-5 office work, well, you can imagine it wasn’t the best time of my life :) However, I had a vision and worked towards it. For me, my company has been and will always be the way to gain freedom and independence. I didn’t want a boss, that’s why I preferred to bootstrap and not go through the typical investment rounds because you end up doing what the VCs tell you. I preferred to grow slowly, at a steady pace and grunt work and take money only from my customers.  The three main mistakes I committed were: Taking full-time jobs. If you need money to pay the bills while you grow your company, do some freelancing. It’s best to be the owner of your own time.Not looking for a sales co-founder from the beginning. BTW, if you know of anyone who’s interested, point him or her to me )Coding too much. Building more features won’t make your product better, killing unused features will. I could have saved months of building stuff that no one ever used. ‍",,," I think my greatest disadvantage is that I come from a cultural background where going into business is frowned upon. Whether you like it or not, the environment you grow in has a lot of influence in your beliefs, your fears and the way you deal with the problems you encounter in life. Starting a business reveals all this “subconscious programming”, forces you to deal with it and do a lot of inner work. Regarding the market, the main disadvantage is that it’s very saturated with marketing and website analysis tools. When I launched in 2013 there were only a few tools, but now it’s not a blue ocean anymore. Since MetricSpot was the first tool to be launched fully in Spanish we managed to capture a portion of the market share.  Our main disadvantage compared to our competitors is that we’re an “indie” company whose objective is to provide us with the lifestyle we want for the team. We’re 100% remote and prefer to grow slowly so we don’t have to take orders from VCs. I guess we would be more successful if we raised 500K€, opened an office and created a team… but our customers love us for who we are and what we do and we want to keep it that way for now. ‍"," Although I had taken a PHP programming course the previous year, I had never developed any applications. I only had done some smaller stuff in HTML and CSS, so I had to learn to code almost from scratch. The timing was great because at that moment I was looking forward to learning how to code, and learning by doing (working on a real project) is the best way. For the MVP I used Codeigniter as a Model-View-Controller framework, jQuery for front-end animations and logic, and MongoDB as a database. I coded everything myself (AKA: copied and pasted a lot of stuff from StackOverflow) and from time to time I asked a cousin Juan (an engineer who had bootstrapped his own eco-groceries delivery company) for help.  After two months, in January 2013, I launched the first version of MetricSpot. It looked okay-ish, but it was enough. The MVP only had one of the tools, the Home page SEO analysis report. ‍ I contacted a few marketing bloggers to publish a review and MetricSpot began to get traction: I reached the 1000 visits/day milestone in only two weeks. Most people only notice you when you’re already successful. “Lucky guy”, they say. However, they’re missing out the big picture: I had no money at the time and I had to work my ass off to get my business running. I freelanced for 6 months to pay the bills, later I got a job as a software developer and worked nights and weekends on MetricSpot. In January 2015 MetricSpot was finally generating enough income to quit my job and focus 100% on the company.",," After graduating I worked as an internationalization consultant for 3 years. It was a great experience, but I felt it was getting too repetitive and needed a change.  In 2011, during a trip to India, I had the opportunity to get in touch with many Digital Nomads, young entrepreneurs who worked remotely and who managed their startups 100% online. I had already read the book ""The Four Hour Workweek"" by Tim Ferriss, but to meet the people who had brought that dream to reality had a great impact on me. At the beginning of 2012, a friend and I founded an online marketing agency in Spain. It started very well, but we had different criteria regarding the management of the company and after a few months I decided to sell my participation in the agency. My friend wanted to go all-in in expenses, even if our income had been way below what we expected. I wanted to bootstrap and increase our overhead as we grew. During the months I was with the agency I realized that almost all the available SEO tools were only in English (or poorly translated) and had prices that were not affordable by the smaller agencies in Spain and Latin America. In addition, at that time each tool covered a specific functionality of the many that an SEO agency needs in its day to day (on-page analysis, backlinks analysis, tracking SERP positions of keywords, reporting to clients, etc.). There was no complete suite in Spanish, and if you had to spend between 50€ and 150€ per month for each tool, the small agency that was starting was unable to make ends meet. I saw it clear, so I started to code. ‍"," If I could talk to my former self in 2013 I would tell him: “Don’t get that job, find a mentor and get a co-founder”. I’d remind myself from time to time to code less and sell more. Actually, I’d write that on a billboard in front of my window. I also wish I had spent more time speaking with my customers and less time blogging in the beginning. However, this last one’s tricky... let me explain: you’ve got to differentiate between “users” and “customers”, the first ones don’t pay for the bills but the latter do. Once you start getting feedback from your users/customers, you have enough input to start shipping new features every month. However, as I got better as a Product Manager (one of the co-founders should have that role) I became aware that I was bloating MetricSpot with useless stuff that users asked for that customers didn’t actually use, nor were they willing to pay for. I was building “nice to have” stuff, not pain relievers. ‍"," Building the product was the easy part, selling it is where it gets tricky. You know, creating something people want and asking them to pay you for it is something they don’t teach you at school.  I started off by contacting marketing influencers and asking them to write a review of out tool on their blog. That worked out really well. Later, I focused on content marketing and email marketing drip campaigns for user onboarding & activation. Drip campaigns are great for automation. Content marketing hasn’t been so effective at attracting the right kind of customers. I also launched an affiliate program to motivate our best users and marketing bloggers to promote our tools. This tactic has worked well, bringing a steady number of new users every month. I’ve tried every possible tactic but I haven’t experienced that “exponential growth” that all marketers preach about. I’m quite disappointed with marketing, it might work with B2C products but I’ve recently found out that for B2B a CRM and plain old sales work best. That’s why now I’m looking to partner with someone who’s an expert in sales in order to take the company to the next level. ‍"," If you want to get in touch, the fastest way is via LinkedIn. I also share cool stuff on my Twitter and Medium accounts."," I would certainly recommend surrounding yourself with the right kind of people. There’s this phrase from Jim Rohn which says “you’re the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with” which I believe is 100% true. So, go to networking meetups to meet other entrepreneurs. Join a mastermind group. Find a coach. I’ve done a lot of reading on startups, business and marketing during the past years. I’ve read tons of blogs, Medium articles, newsletters, podcasts… all these new tactics, metrics, etc. They can become somewhat addictive.  I’ve stopped consuming all this “entrepreneur & marketing media” for three main reasons: There are many factors that determine success. What worked for them probably won’t work for you.Everyone else is applying the SAME tactics, so they’ve become useless.It’s making you lose focus on the only important thing that works: getting shit done. The best source of learning is getting on the phone or Skype with your potential customers, establishing an H2H connection (human-to-human) with them and making an effort to understand his or her needs.

147,microconf," Hi, I’m Rob Walling. I’m 46 years old and located in Minneapolis. I’m a serial SaaS founder, advisor, and now an investor in SaaS companies. I’ve bootstrapped and sold multiple startups, most recently an email service provider named Drip. Now I spend my days working on Startups for the Rest of Us, MicroConf, and TinySeed. Startups for the Rest of Us is the longest-running podcast focused on software entrepreneurship, approaching 600 episodes with over 10 million downloads. MicroConf is the largest community in the world for bootstrapped SaaS founders. We launched in 2011 and have hosted thousands of founders at more than two dozen in-person events, as well as our online community MicroConf Connect. TinySeed is a fund and accelerator designed for bootstrapped SaaS founders. We run a year-long, fully remote startup accelerator focused on helping companies grow faster. We offer funding, advice, mentorship, and community to two batches per year in the Americas, and starting next year, one batch a year in the European timezones. ",," The hardest part of building a community is that it takes a long time. And trying to “growth hack” the process will result in a crappy community. I believe authentic interactions over time are crucial to building trust between people. And trust is what a great community is built on. We’ve made many mistakes over the years, including when we booked 12 speakers to each speak for an hour at a two-day event (our first one). So it was six hours of talks per day. It was way too much information and the attendees tuned out after the first four. The thing we’ve learned, though, is that events must evolve or they die. And evolution means you have to try new things, even though some of those will flop. We’ve had speakers on stage who didn’t deliver. We’ve had sessions we thought would be great that turned out bad. At the time, these feel like mistakes, and I guess in a sense, they are. But without taking those risks and failing, I don’t believe we could have evolved the event like we have. ‍",," As this MicroConf community began to mature, I noticed more bootstrapped founders considering raising small amounts of money. They would find a few successful founders, often at MicroConf events, and raise $100k-$500k to have funds to work with in the early days, but with the goal of never raising another funding round. With earnings from my companies, I invested in a handful of them. I soon realized there were many more viable B2B SaaS companies than I’d realized who wanted to raise a relatively small amount of funding without having to step on the venture capital roller coaster. Circa 2011, I had the idea of starting a “YC for Bootstrappers,” but raising a venture fund sounded like something I wouldn’t enjoy, so I shelved it. Flash forward to 2018, and I realized it was an ideal time to start it. I viewed it as a big opportunity to invest in more SaaS founders than I could personally afford to, but also offer exposure to early-stage B2B SaaS as an asset class to investors. So as part of MicroConf, we started TinySeed, the first startup accelerator focused on SaaS bootstrappers. We raised our first fund of about $4.7M in 2019 and closed our second fund of almost $28M in 2021. We expect to invest in and support more than 120 bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS companies between these two funds.",," Publishing my book led to starting a podcast with a co-host, Mike Taber, called Startups for the Rest of Us in March of 2010. The podcast began as two software entrepreneurs talking about their journeys. Between that and an online community we started, we realized that while message boards were fine, we wanted to meet people face to face (“IRL” as the kids say these days). So we decided to bootstrap a conference. Never. Do. That. Since we didn’t have the money to pay a hotel up-front, we got a first right of refusal on a couple of dates at an old hotel in Las Vegas. We then asked a few speakers like Patio11, Hiten Shah, and Andrew Warner to speak. At the time, our tagline was unique: The Conference for Self-Funded Startups. There were zero events like this for bootstrappers. We proceeded to hack together a static HTML landing page, promote it to our podcast and blog audiences, and submit it to Hacker News...all the avenues you would pursue in 2010. We got enough interest to start selling tickets, though in the end, we didn’t sell nearly as many as we’d hoped. Our original goal was 225 attendees, and we had right around 85 paying attendees. Ouch. Running an event was way more work than we thought, and we almost lost tens of thousands of dollars but were saved by a last-minute sponsorship from Microsoft. We wound up just about breaking even, and although the day after we swore never to run another in-person event, we’ve now run dozens of them over 10 years. And we’ve since expanded from in-person events to our online Slack group MicroConf Connect, mastermind matching, our YouTube Video Vault, and several other resources we’ve built for the SaaS community. ",," I was an unhappy software developer for years before I started working on side projects. This was the early 2000s, so there were no communities like Indie Hackers or MicroConf. I read Paul Graham and Joel Spolsky and started blogging around the same time as Peldi and Patio11, who were coming onto the scene around the same time. After several years of experiments and missteps, I lived full-time on product income and quit the day job and consulting in late 2008. It took me a few years before I stopped calling myself a developer and started calling myself an entrepreneur or business owner. Startups were a means to an end to me. I wanted three things, and I thought they could give them to me: I wanted the freedom to work on what I enjoyed. I wanted the purpose of working on something interesting. And I wanted to maintain healthy relationships by not working long hours or having a crazy commute and choosing who I worked with. I had started blogging about my journey in 2005, and by the time I quit the day job, I had built up a nice following. These were the days of RSS, and I think I had 15k or 20k subscribers. As I talked about my journey, I received a lot of questions about how I did it and turned those questions and the common pitfalls I could see developers making into my first book called ""Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer’s Guide to Launching a Startup.""

148,mishra-motors," Hello Failory, thanks for talking to me. I was consulting in tech and business straight out of college, started a few ventures and am now co-founder of a company called Crowdraising (The platform for the future of work).  My first company and very close to my heart was an electric motorcycle company that I started called Mishra Motors It was right around the time Mission Electric and Electric vehicles, in general, were taking off. It was going to be the premier electric sports bike in India.  "," The problem was I was a software guy attacking a hard problem with not enough capital. We had a great team in-house, but the two main things we had against us were timing and capital which are a consequence of being fully powered by passion. We realized this because our tech was proven a couple of years before we started, but the market wasn't there. We spoke to regulators and potential strategists who knew we were on the right track but could see the problems we would face being a small software oriented team. In most conversations, people would bring up these two issues and we knew we had to change something if we were to survive.   ", Building vehicles is an endeavor not to be taken lightly because of the regulators involved and the large strategic partnerships you have to make to be able to just launch. This point is further validated by the fact that our product team got funding from the leading motorcycle manufacturer in 2016 and has now gone on to do a consumer-oriented motorcycle.                                                                                                                                               ,,," I can categorize (with 20-20 hindsight) our disadvantages into three categories: Team: Led by a software/ information tech person, building a hardware company with no previous experience.Timing: We were right on the cusp of electric vehicles taking off, so we had to educate the customer in making a premium/sports oriented purchase in this category.External Partners: Regulators are a big deal and its best to have them on your side. We didn’t or were slow to make strategic partners.",, I worked with the team that was at the first all-electric Isle of Man TT. (This team has now gone on to raise institutional/strategic capital and are growing the consumer side of things) We started by retrofitting an existing Yamaha FZ-06 with our custom EMS and battery setup. We worked with an automotive designer who was working on Ergonomics and had connections to get us into the New Delhi auto show.," Mishra Motors was to be the premier electric sports bike in India. Think of it as Tesla for motorcycles. Battery tech was growing at a rapid pace and it was the right time to create a motorcycle. Electric engines have a torque curve that appeals to motorcycle riders. With the right ergonomics, it was a great product. We were at the prototype stage and were ready to launch it at the New Delhi Autoshow in 2014. The design was set, I had a tech partner and things were looking good. ‍"," If I had to start over, I would go after strategic partners first and get to marketing way quicker. Create a public awareness campaign and make decisions based on building long-term. I would start working on creating a relationship with the regulator which would have helped us with market timing.    One thing I always recommend is figuring out a customer base before you begin and building to solve their problems.  Also, I would ask entrepreneurs, especially first-timers, to go after problems that they can solve with their core competency (and maybe not go after industries that require heavy regulator approval). And don't spend all of your savings on one idea, there will always be Idea 2 or venture2.  ",, You can read about my current venture and I write about the future of work and decentralization here.,,,Transportation,Lack of Funds,India,"March 17, 2018",Naveen Mishra,https://www.failory.com/interview/mishra-motors,"['http://crowdraising.co/', 'http://naveenmishra.co/']",failure,0,,Mishra Motors was to be the premier electric sports bike in India.

149,mongoose-cricket," Hey all! My name is Thomas Evans, I’m 28 and based in London. I’ve worked my way through a number of startups, the majority successful with one notable failure, to a point where I now find myself at EmailOctopus, an email marketing platform, as COO. That notable failure was Mongoose, a sports equipment manufacturer, which was most widely known for its introduction of a radical new cricket bat in 2009. At Mongoose I managed the production and distribution of those bats, sourcing the bats from contracted manufacturers in Sussex, Huntingdon and a place called Meerut in India. The business model was relatively simple, initially launching as a direct-to-consumer brand in 2009 selling via our website, before moving into retailers in 2010. We were mostly widely known for sponsoring Matthew Hayden during the Indian Premier League. ‍"," When there is such an aggressive launch and growth strategy with a business, it’s significantly more risky than running a steady, growing, bootstrapped software business. With the risk involved, there were a number of bets we had to make.  We had to bet our budget on sponsorship. As a new product to a very old game, we needed to build confidence in our new product.  We had to show faith in the product and be aware that if it did have the success we’d hoped, then it would be copied. Securing the copyright, design registrations and trademarks across the large cricket playing nations cost almost $30,000 in legal fees. We had to bet on the Indian market, as the largest cricket playing nation in the World that our bat would be wanted over there following the IPL. All these things meant that we had to raise and then spend a lot of money (around $300,000 in total), before we had the sales to show for it. It was a classic venture-backed business and with those businesses that are so reliant on investment in the early, you can always say if we had had more funding then things may have been different.  ‍ I think it all boils down the product though. I don’t think cricket is a sport which adopts innovation well. It’s a classic, reserved, classically English game. We were aware of that challenge early on and felt we could overcome that as mentioned earlier, in India. The Indian market is very different to any other market, it’s incredibly fragmented. Selling across their 29 states into retailers is an incredibly difficult challenge (the internet had less than 10% market penetration at the time) and reaching the right customers at the right price point is something we just didn’t do.  With our glitzy launch and player sponsorship during IPL 2 (held in 2010) we spent well over $130,000 trying to crack what could have been an incredibly lucrative market - but we sold fewer than 60 bats in the country. We fared a little better in the UK, selling 3-4,000 bats, but it was miles away from covering our marketing spend."," The biggest challenge, as I’ve mentioned a few times, was building up brand recognition and faith in a new product. And as said previously, that meant persuading professional cricketers to use it.  We hoped to persuade them by paying them lots of money and incentivising the usage of the bat. The MMi3 bat was to form as the standout piece of our range, and where we planned to generate the most revenue. Also at the time, Nike, Adidas, and Reebok decided to enter the market and sponsor cricket players. Now, when these multinationals are sponsoring a players cricket bat, they are not looking to recoup that spend in sales of cricket bats - they’re looking to build brand recognition, associated themselves with a hero, and sell their trainers. It pushed prices up and meant we had to spend more than we would have done only a few years earlier, or later when they left the market. Another challenge was the production of the bats. As someone who now runs a Software business, I’m much happier now I don’t have to stock a physical product. Physical products, such as the bats, kit bags, and protective pads/gloves were almost all produced in India which meant lead times were in excess of 60 days. For an order of 1,000 bats we would have a 45 day production time, then a further 30 day wait as they were shipped across on a container to Felixstowe.  That lead time, historically, has worked okay for cricket brands. Brands who have made bats for years have a predictable business. They’ll sell those bats to in September, send it straight for production, before delivery in November (Christmas) and March (just before the cricket season).  For a new brand to the market, though, it was tough. We were so reliant on players using the bats and scoring runs, that retailers did not want to commit to large orders. And those retailers that did order, we’d need to wait 90 days for payment with us fronting the cash for manufacture - so yes, there were regular cash-flow issues! When players did use the range and score runs, as Matthew Hayden did in 2010, we couldn’t produce the bats quickly enough and get them into retailers fast enough, resulting in upset customers. ‍ Of course we tried to forecast as much as possible and look at key televised games which would cause spikes in demand, but with around 300 SKUs (individual products) it was hard to ensure we had stock in the right places. I’ll touch briefly on SKUS and explain why a seemingly relatively simple business ends up having over 300 unique product barcodes. Again, this is another nuance of physical products which we don’t suffer from in SaaS. At Mongoose, we produced, to begin with, 2 distinct models of cricket bats. Sounds easy? Though when you look at those 2 models, there were 4 grades pitched at different price points from beginner to professional level. Those grades then had to be offered in the 7 Junior sizes along with at least 3 variations in weight for the adult range. And that was just the bats. We offered protective pads, gloves, thigh guards and bags which all needed to be stocked in different sizes and dexterities.  Take it from me - stick to software! ",,,," The initial idea for the bat, as the story goes, was dreamed up by Marcus as he watched a cricket match from his hospital bed, recovering from a stroke. Cricket bats hadn’t changed much in design since the turn of the century, but the game had with the introduction of faster paced Twenty20 games (T20 games last for around 3hrs, compared to the 5 days of a test match) where the sole focus was on attacking.  Following the initial idea that cricket bats should be updated to match the changing demands of the game, we worked with a small manufacturer in Cambridgeshire to design the bat. And following some tweaks, such as re-positioning of the ‘splice’ (a cricket bat is made up of 2 parts, the join is called the splice), the unique design was born. An explanation on the bat, as featured on C4 news:  The bat was initially code-named the ‘Albert Trott’ bat, in honor of the only person who had hit a ball over the Lord’s Pavilion (Lord’s is a cricket stadium, colloquially known as  the home of cricket). After some deliberation, the bat was renamed the Mongoose, as it was small and ferocious, and 22nd May 2009 the new bat and brand were launched. There was quite a big, glitzy, PR launch planned at Lord’s where a conference room had been hired. Our PR agency arranged almost all of this and through contacts, we’d roped in a number of ex-professional cricketers to show off the bat in a practice area. Lord’s made an amazing backdrop for all the press photos and interviews, giving credence to this unusual looking bat and from a PR perspective the launch was a roaring success receiving coverage in every British newspaper, a 5-minute segment on BBC Breakfast TV and a 10-minute segment on Channel 4 news.  ‍ The website at the time we were using for our direct-to-consumer sales was a Wordpress site, customized to power our e-commerce sales. Over the first week since the launch we sold 24 bats via the website, making around £5,000 in sales.  We had no idea on how the launch would be received and no cash to build up stock, so the bats were all handmade to order by Hunts County, the manufacturer based in Huntingdon. They were a small, family-owned business, who made bats the old school way, by hand, with a drawknife and spokeshave so their knowledge of technology was limited, to say the least.  To get our orders to them I would have to email across a manually updated Excel doc every day and then follow up by phone to check they understood it!",," I cannot take any credit for starting Mongoose, that belongs to Marcus who designed the bat and brand, but the story of how I ended up working alongside him from launch through to our eventual failure is an interesting one... Back when I was 16, I was fascinated with sports equipment. Cricket was my chosen sport at the time, following England’s relative success, and I found myself enamoured with the manufacture of cricket bats. I ran a cricket equipment comparison website and forum which covered the best brands, to the point where I was banned from using the internet at school as I was too busy running the website. ‍ Leaving school following my GCSEs (exams we take as a 16-year-old volunteered to work a couple of days a week on a farm in Crewe sanding and finishing handmade cricket bats for a small family run business. Bringing in money by working at Toys ‘R’ Us and handing out newspapers the other 3 days a week. Through saving my salary, I eventually saved up enough to travel to India where I worked for 2 months in a factory in Meerut (where 90% of the World’s cricket bats are made) learning the ins-and-outs of the trade.  ‍ I returned to the UK on April 2009, and within a month I was contacted by a friend who had heard of a new cricket brand launching and I was introduced to the man behind that brand, Marcus. Marcus, is an expert in branding and had spent his career in the advertising industry, however, like me, his passion lied in cricket. Within a week of our initial meeting, I had moved down to London to work with him, managing the production of the bats. The hope that my understanding of the industry and batmaking, alongside his encyclopedic knowledge of branding and infectious energy would be a match made in heaven. ‍"," From a personal perspective? I probably wouldn’t change much at all. Aged 18, I was working in an industry that I loved. Over the space of 2 years I was introduced, or rather learning on the job, to fundraise, account, develop a brand, launch a product, mass produce a product, and most importantly, to never lose sight of your outgoings. It’s important to remember that when a business fails, it’s not just those within that business struggles, the whole ecosystem around it does too. The investors lose money the small family run suppliers who support you do too. Seeing this happen first hand taught me to be a lot more responsible and thankful. From the business perspective, speaking 10 years on, I would have spent more time researching on the size of the market and realistically forecasting as to how big we could be. Which would result in us being less optimistic with our assumptions. Ultimately, Mongoose felt we could conquer, very quickly, a large share of the market that’s very tough to do. I must stress, that whilst the business was a failure, entering into administration. We did have our successes along the way. The feeling watching one of the World’s best players smash 93 runs in the IPL using your bat was unparalleled. Seeing your brand trending on Twitter, as thousands of people talk about it, gave a sense of pride. Walking up and collecting an award for the best technological innovation in sport, in front of sporting legends such as Haile Gebrselassie and Sir Alex Ferguson, is something I’ll never come close to either.  Business can give you so much to remember, even when it ends in failure. ‍"," We initially relied a lot on PR from the launch to get the brand in front of people and very quickly we become recognizable as a cricket bat brand. It was hard not to be recognized when your product looks so different!  ‍ Once the brand and bat were recognized, the next battle was to gain acceptance in the market and that could only be done through usage. We raised a round of investment from a number of high net worth individuals, who worked in the City, and went to work on signing up professional cricketers who could be sponsored by us and use the brand. The first player signed was Stuart Law, a veteran of the game who was playing for one of the smaller County sides. As an elder statesman of the game he lent some credence to the brand, however, he only played a single match with the bat and that match was not televised. We therefore needed to branch out and sign additional players, who would ideally be playing in televised tournaments. In total over the 2 years we sponsored around 30 players, ranging from the photogenic England bowler James Anderson, through to star Australian batsman Matthew Hayden.  ‍ Mongoose produced 2 bats for our players, the small, famous MMi3 bat and a more traditional bat called the CoR3. Players were heavily incentivized to use the more famous bat as it would result in lots more coverage for the brand if they performed.  By relying solely on endorsements through professional players the whole success of the brand in turn relies on the performances of those players when the cameras are turned on them. An injury, an unlucky shot, or seeing the player dropped from the side would still see the player earn their retainer as a sponsored player of Mongoose. For a star batsman of a side in the Indian Premier League (the premier Twenty20 tournament at the time) we were needing to pay around $100,000 in fees, for what was a 5-week tournament. A player, if selected, would play 14 games in that tournament so we were needing to pay around $7,000 per match before they’d even hit a ball.  This montage was put together by ITV, just after Hayden had score 93 off 43 balls: Within the sponsorship contracts were also some fun bonuses and incentives. Some of these were realistic and were designed to reward the player for strong performances, others were completely unrealistic and had almost zero chance of every happening - however they made a good PR story. Remember the Lord’s Pavilion that Albert Trott hit the ball over? If a Mongoose player were to clear that he’d receive £250,000 ($350,000) in cash. Trott cleared the pavilion in 1899, no-one had done it since and they probably never will - but it helped make a few headlines when we signed one player who probably wouldn’t have made headlines otherwise. ‍"," I’ve written a little bit more on the Mongoose story over on Medium, though it’ll probably only interest the most hardcore of cricket fans. You can still buy a Mongoose Cricket bat today, the brand was bought out of administration and lives on though none of the original founders, staff or investors are involved any longer. If you want to get in contact with me personally, feel free to contact me via Twitter or via the EmailOctopus website."," I now spend a lot of time reading IndieHackers. That style of business, following such a grand failure, really appeals. Seeing small teams grow profitable, sustainable businesses is amazing and I love jumping on there to support others too.  In the same vein, I enjoy reading books such as Rework by the Basecamp team and I’m just reading Technically Wrong, a book by the excellent Sara Wachter-Boettcher, on the impact technology can have on the broader world. Like most who work in tech, I’m fascinated by it, and want to ensure we grow EmailOctopus responsibly, so it can at the very least not detract from society.  "," We did achieve revenue through sales of our bats, the equipment was stocked in every major cricket retailer here in the UK from the behemoth that is Sports Direct through to the online specialists like Owzat Cricket.  Our last season as Mongoose Cricket Ltd, was the 2011 season (September 2010 - September 2011), where we sold in the UK over 2,000 bats which would have worked out at around £130,000 in revenue of which around £55,000 was net profit.  The revenues, though, were dwarfed by the expenses and it was no surprise that player sponsorship was the largest expense. Our largest single sponsorship contract was just shy of £100,000 before bonuses and our total spend, across all players at its peak, would have been in the £200,000 ball park. An expensively put together press launch and video for the signing of one of our players Staff was where we ran a very lean team with only 4 of us forming part of the team covering Sales, Production, Accounting, and Marketing with all of us wearing different hats to try to drive the business forward. Sales was a particularly tough job, involving driving up and down the UK to retailers to check-in how they were doing and whether they needed more stock. Those travel costs easily exceeded £1,000 each month just in fuel - I was glad I didn’t have a driver's licence. Consultancy was where our staffing costs soon added up, though. A contract CFO was hired to help us with our 2 rounds of fundraising (and a potential 3rd) and legal fees were racked up in protecting the Mongoose brand and unique design.  ‍",e-Commerce,Bad Marketing,United Kingdom,"August 21, 2019",Thomas Evans,https://www.failory.com/interview/mongoose-cricket,"['https://medium.com/@td_evans/batman-a-story-of-a-cricket-bat-ea5815612343', 'https://mongoosecricket.com', 'http://twitter.com/td_evans', 'https://emailoctopus.com']",failure,0,,"In 2009, Thomas Evans began working alongside Marcus, the creator of a radical new cricket bat named the Mongoose.

150,motionthink," My name is Andrew Chen, 39, based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I am currently working on a personal finance content website called Hack Your Wealth, which focuses on helping high earners be smarter and more efficient when it comes to earning, saving, investing, and protecting their assets. Earlier in my career, I was the founding CEO of a technology startup company called MotionThink, which was focused on building productivity tools for freelance workers. I was responsible for product development. The business model we were pursuing was to either sell software directly as a monthly license to freelance workers or charge a revenue share. "," The main cause of our failure, as is the case with most failed startups, was suicide.  It was clear after 6 months that the founders were not aligned on a shared vision for what to build, how to build it, and what our core motivations even were for starting our own company. I think I realized we were going to fail after it became apparent we were spending more time each day debating and negotiating and arguing than simply taking action and doing. It would take multiple units of discussion for every unit of work output, and in the early days of a startup, that ratio should be the mirror opposite. In terms of the mechanics of shutting down the company, I resigned as CEO. My co-founders tried to continue for another month or so, but decided to unwind the company entirely after that. It felt really disappointing to end the startup, especially only after a few months, and I sometimes wonder if there could have been a different outcome. But I have learned that, more than any business idea, the most essential ingredient for starting any company is to make sure you partner with co-founders with whom you are 100% aligned in terms of goals and motivations for starting a company. The business idea will pivot and change a lot, especially in the early days. But people don’t change. So you need to make sure you’re aligned with your co-founders to have an actual chance at succeeding. ‍"," The biggest mistake I made was actually a structural flaw of the incubator/accelerator I participated in. The explicit requirement of the program was to apply without having yet committed to any co-founders. This stands in stark contrast to every other major incubator that just about requires your founding team to already be formed – and to have been working together for a long time and, ideally, to already have some demonstrated traction – before you apply. This is one reason my accelerator program ended after just 2 batches – it was clear the solo-applicant model does not work. When I look back, all our product and customer development struggles, the long philosophical debates, etc, stemmed from the fact that the founders simply didn’t know each other well. And as we got to know each other, we realized our goals, motivations, and values differed from one another – on some issues only a little bit, but on other issues a great deal. The #1 reason startups fail is because the founders quit or break up, resulting in startup suicide. This is what happened to us. In retrospect, the “right way” to join any incubator is to have your founding team already formed and with a reasonably long track record of working together. That’s probably the biggest thing you can do to de-risk your startup. Mistakes and market challenges are bound to arise, but that’s OK because your product and ideas will drastically change as you learn about your customers and market. What you cannot change are the co-founders you start the journey with because, frankly, people don’t change. So you have to be sure you know your co-founders well enough, both personally and in terms of work style, to feel confident that, as a team, you’re able to go the distance. ‍",,,," My co-founders and I prototyped many different products over a period of 6 months but eventually did not release a working product. We started by interviewing freelancers and small business owners, trying to better understand pain points in their workflows. Almost everyone said finding new clients/customers was a huge pain point many also said getting paid on time by clients/customers was a pain point. We built stubbed-out prototypes in Photoshop and HTML/JS (without real data) so we could simulate different product ideas and get feedback from potential users. This design-feedback-iterate loop gave us learnings, but differences in opinion among the co-founders also quickly emerged, both in terms of business direction and in terms of what our goals were for doing the startup. These differing views soon became too big to ignore and, eventually, too big to proceed with -- this was ultimately the cause of our startup’s demise. I learned a lot about how to do a startup through this experience, and importantly how crucial it is to be aligned with your co-founders on foundational motivations and philosophy from the very beginning. Without this, it is very difficult for a startup to survive.",," When I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area from New York City years ago, I wanted to start and run my own tech company. I spent a couple years meeting people in the industry and learning and reading about tech trends before taking the plunge. I joined a now-defunct startup incubator/accelerator funded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s venture capital firm, Innovation Endeavors, which is where I met my co-founders and started MotionThink. In joining the accelerator, all founders came in without a pre-commitment to an idea. There was a co-founder “dating” process where we matched up with which co-founders we most wanted to work with, and once our teams were formed we embarked on a need-finding / design-thinking process to come up with a startup idea. MotionThink’s focus on freelance workers came out of this process. My background was in law, business, and finance. I am a licensed attorney in 3 states and worked at McKinsey and in private equity investing before starting MotionThink. "," If I were to do it all over again, I would start a company in a more organic way. I would start by just working on side projects with friends or colleagues. Just nights and weekends to start. It’s totally fine to do a side project while keeping your day job. I’d see if we could first develop some interesting insight, hypothesis, or idea about a market or industry. Then see if we could hack some prototypes together to get customer feedback, customer interest, and – ideally – even pre-generate a sale or two to validate whether the product idea has promise. It’s not important to declare officially that you’re starting a company in the beginning. To be sure, it’s helpful to discuss with your colleagues that that is your desired goal, and to have early discussions on goals and motivations for working together (and potentially starting a company). But in the early days, actually filing incorporation paperwork, etc, is unnecessary. Once you have a good rhythm working with your would-be co-founders and you’ve all tested each other out in terms of interest and commitment level, then it might be worthwhile to start formalizing things into a company. This is because, by this point, you’ll already have a track record of working together and you’ll have a good feel for each other’s personalities and work styles.  Co-founder relationships cannot be rushed. It really is like marrying someone (or a few people). And you wouldn’t get married without dating, right? So, if I were going to start another company, I would “date” first by working with friends or colleagues on informal projects to start, and then discuss along the way and agree on “what would have to happen” to justify e.g. quitting our jobs to take the plunge full time. Lastly, I would spend most of my time investigating a market/industry/customer pain point that I was profoundly, intrinsically interested in. A good way to tell what you’re interested in is to see what you write a lot about (if you journal), or what you read a lot about when you read the news. If you have been consistently writing and/or reading about a topic or industry for more than 2 years, then that is a pretty strong sign you have profound, intrinsic interest in that topic. (Anything less than 2 years is hard to tell, because that could just be a temporary interest that fades away sooner or later). ‍",," Learn more about Andrew’s current work by checking out Hack Your Wealth, his personal finance website, as well as the Hack Your Wealth Facebook Group and Hack Your Wealth on Twitter.", Paul Graham’s essays & Y Combinator’s blog - Great and practical advice about startups and entrepreneurship written in easy-to-read language.Startup School - A great live event (not live-streamed too) teaching important lessons about entrepreneurship.Essays by the a16z partners - Thought leaders on technology trends.Founders at Work - Important book about the early days of important startups.The Lean Startup - Great book on product development.Mixergy Podcast - Thoughtful podcast interviews with founders.First Round Capital newsletter - Thoughtful essays about startups and company building. ," We did not achieve revenue.

151,motobox," Hi! I have a fairly eclectic background – I started out in physics,  eventually getting a degree in biochemistry. While working in the lab I started creating data analysis programs for other researchers and got hooked on programming. I ended up becoming a firmware engineer and getting a graduate certificate in software engineering while working. After five years of that, I transitioned to professional data science, which is my current day job. My current side project is Compelling Science Fiction, a digital science fiction magazine. I work with several volunteer editors and advisers to print high-quality science fiction stories and pay authors professional rates. The magazine is now considered a SFWA qualifying market (one of only 36 worldwide). The project is quite a bit different from my last startup, which was focused on automotive telematics. ‍"," The problem was reaching customers. When we didn't reach our Kickstarter goal, but all the backers that had heard of us were super excited, we realized that we hadn't done enough outreach.  "," We really needed to refine our message and get better at succinctly communicating. The project was a fairly complicated one, and it was easy to lose people when describing it. More than anything else, though, we should have consulted with a marketing pro to get the word out better.                                                                                                                                             ",,," I and my co-founder were both highly technical (he was a firmware/hardware engineer and I was more focused on software), so we didn't have the business side covered as well as we should have. It was also our first real foray into startups, so we were a little trepidacious. If we had been a little more willing to jump in all the way, and if we were better at outreach, we would have done a lot better. We had a lot going on, and weren't willing to fully commit without funding.",," This is the part we were really terrible at, and I learned the most from. Our entire strategy revolved around posting to automotive forums and trying to get articles written about the product, which didn't really work out."," My friend and I created MotoBox because we wanted to help developers create an ecosystem of applications built on vehicle data. The best description of the project can be found on our old Kickstarter project page. The project involved three components: An OBD-II reader with a wifi chip,A set of servers to collect vehicle data, andAPIs that served the data to developers (and to our internal app). The idea was that we'd allow developers to build applications that use vehicle data (things like speed, fuel use, RPM, sensor data, braking data, etc.) and also allows consumers to view their driving data through the app. At the time (2013) the idea seemed novel, but over the next few years, several other similar products were released. Our Kickstarter ended up failing, but we made some interesting connections. There was a guy in Denmark who really wanted our product to put in his fleet of rental cars. Unfortunately, since we didn't get the funding we needed, we scrapped the project, and it wasn't until years later that I really internalized how bad I was at finding initial customers. ‍"," I would have spent way more time validating the market and gathering a potential customer base. To this day I don't know how big the market was for our product (although based on the success of other similar startups, it looks like it would have worked out). This was a huge learning experience for me – you hear a lot about finding product/market fit and doing validation before starting, but this project really helped me internalize that concept.    Validate your idea first, and if you're not taking funding, make sure you have large margins. I cannot emphasize this enough. If your margins are too small you'll never be able to bootstrap. Specifically, your cost of customer acquisition has to be smaller than your expected lifetime customer value.

152,mubert, My name is Alexey Kochetkov and I’ve been developing Mubert for over 6 years. Our startup is a platform powered by music producers that helps creators and brands generate unlimited royalty-free music with the help of AI. Mubert's mission is to empower and protect the creators and to democratize the creator economy. ‍,," It’s always hard to be the first. Mubert was the startup that presented generative music to the world. I mean it. As a result, the biggest obstacle was that it was tough to explain what generative music is. But when people get what it is, the first word is WOW! Due to this, we faced obstacles with new users and sales as people didn’t know that they needed it. We tried hard to bring our mission to our users with the help of other artists and influencers, blog articles, etc. As time passed, we began to have competitors. And in fact, their appearance also helped convey the correct understanding and value of generative music in the modern world.  Moreover, someone may think that all our pivots resulted from previous mistakes made in product or marketing. But I wouldn’t say so. Every pivot gave us a new breath and a new product. All our previous products still exist and work. More than that, all of them create the massive ecosystem around music and content creation that I always dreamt about.  ",," We have the following accomplishments to date: App of the year on Google Play 2019App of the day in App Store (170 countries) - November 2019Mubert Render Took Product of the Day and of the Week on Product Hunt (Sep 2021)2+ million overall downloads worldwide282K app users40 API clients After successfully pivoting to the B2B market with our API last year, we decided to move further into the creative economy. We created the AI music stock for content creators, agencies and brands and market it now. ",," Right after the idea of Mubert came to me back in 2016, out team immediately started creating the MVP. At the time, it was just a web interface with a list of genres and endless generative streams. The first people to see the concept were our friends and colleagues. Our first public release was at one of Russia’s largest music festivals, where all the participants could influence the music stream in real-time by scanning their emotions. As the feedback was positive, we decided to raise funds for the initial product development and that's how I found myself in the US back in 2017. We were a team of professionals with a deep passion for music and tech and though there were some challenges on our path, we did it! We built the whole ecosystem in less than six months. The first public launch of the app was in late 2017 – an interface with three channels of functional music – but it was first publicly recognized in mid-2018 when we got the App of the Day award in Japan. And since then, Mubert kept growing to what you can see now. We wanted to be freemium, as it’s rather hard to ask people to pay for a product before testing it, especially when it’s an innovative music concept. Though the first versions were completely free, we’ve since limited access to additional channels on a subscription basis.",," Despite having a technical and jazz music education, I chose to pursue a career in the creative industry as the owner and creative director of agencies that developed creative ideas and concepts for Nike, Adidas, BMW and other companies. As a hobby, I used to run long distances like 10, 15 or 21 km every week. One thing that annoyed me was playlists & mixes with unstable tempo & mood. One day an idea came to me -  why can’t the thousands of samples & loops mix automatically into an unlimited stream with a specific tempo related to my pace or cadence? "," Over the years, I realized that challenges are inevitable and I learned to accept them as part of the routine. I like the concept of an ownership mindset, so I focus on taking ownership/responsibility for the results, making decisions and being transparent and honest. "," At Mubert, we genuinely believe in our brand and the power it carries. For us, cultivating our community through word of mouth, collaborating with companies that share our values, choosing to endorse B2B API solutions, supporting artists and democratizing the creator economy is essential. We've collaborated with companies like Sensorium, SkillBox, Restream, DepositPhotos and we’re preparing a bunch of new amazing collaborations in the future.  Moreover, we’ve used Product Hunt as an instrument for lead generation. We had 6 launches there, one every time we launched a new product. The last one was last month, and we had a massive push for our latest product - Mubert Render. All the launches brought us leads, developed our community and validated our ideas. As we’ve made some pivots (sometimes I call myself the Chief Pivot Officer), we started different marketing campaigns for every new product. Of course, we don’t rely only on brand power. We also do SEO-focused articles, ad campaigns, influencers campaigns and PR.  "," You can check our website or visit our social media profiles (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter)."," Being a fully distributed team, we use various tools to organize work and lead communications.

153,muun," Hey, my name is Eelco. I create things. Born in The Netherlands, but for some time now location independent. Exploring one new city at a time, all while running various businesses, projects and doing other creative things. About a year ago I launched Muun. About two weeks ago I shut it down.  "," Albeit all this negativity, I continued working on it. Asking questions to owners and managers. And a new sentiment arose: don't have enough money right now to pay for something like this. At the same time, I learned there were actually quite a lot of products promising to solve the same problems. The big difference was they were years ahead of me in the number of customers and features. Features that were passed the point of a ""simple"" web application. No way in its current state could I compete with the competition. I had a couple of options: hire people to work on the product, set the price to zero dollars or pivot. I decided the latter was the only real option. Hiring people before a product makes money or giving a product away for free goes against my bootstrappers mentality (and is a poor decision generally). I stripped most of the features out of the product and was left with only the community-building features. This was a fairly quick and straightforward process which took just a few days, including changing the marketing pages. The product would now focus on building and maintaining a community. An overview of who and what members were in your community, easily invite them (and to Slack at the same time) by email. And some basic integration with Slack: finding users, give an overview who they were, what they did, etc. This focused approach helped to target the right customers more easily, and it did indeed help get some more (paying) customers. But those were still not keen on paying any money, mostly because they didn't make a lot of money running their communities.  "," The biggest challenge, and a mistake at the same time—as is often—is pushing through even after launch the only thing you hear is crickets. Which means: having a solid marketing plan for post-launch. Continue to interact with new and existing users, helping them solving small pains by creating useful resources, like blogs, video's, guides and more. When day after day, you get people to visit your marketing pages but don't follow-through you start to doubt the product. I did the same, but the messaging could as well be wrong, or the packaging not enticing enough. Fact is I just looked at those bare numbers, without trying to dissect what they really meant. The other big mistake was outsourcing some things prematurely, like the product tour video. If you ask me now, I don't think a product tour video is the best way for a web-based product. Rather spend the time to set up a proper (working) demo or make sign up as unobtrusive as possible. ‍",,,," I've been building web applications for a while and have been using the same stack for about six years. This is a big advantage for a bootstrapper. I reuse visual components, pieces of code, marketing copy and overall best practices I accumulated over these years. The most basic version and one that I demoed to some coworking owners was done in about a week. Just built to see what their reaction would be. Whenever I start something new, I work on it full-time for a fixed period of time. This means my other businesses go in ""maintenance mode"" where I only do bugfixes and customer support. I ""launched"" it like this with one plan for around $29, I think. The launch was just letting the interviewees know about the launch and sending out a mailing to the people who signed up through the landing page I set up. And then… Crickets. Nothing. Nada. People visiting the site visited maybe one more page and then left. In the meantime, I had to catch up on some work on my main business, which in turn didn't help Muun. After a few weeks, I emailed the same owners and email list again, along with coworking spaces I visited myself in the past.  ",," As a result of my traveling, I visited a lot of coworking spaces. I noticed that a lot of these spaces lacked processes to run smoothly. Resulting in a lot of missed opportunities, new members, and money. I asked some of the owners and managers about these struggles. They confirmed my observations. Were they willing to pay for it too? Sure, they said. That's all I needed to start building Muun. I set up a landing page outlining my vision and ideas for it and shared that with the world. That resulted in quite a few interested people. I interviewed some of them to get a better idea of their pains. This is crucial and something I learned after 10+ years of building (success and failing) businesses. If you don't have firsthand knowledge of the industry it's impossible to know which features should and should not go into that very famous ""MVP"". Know the difference between their biggest pain and what is nice to have.  "," Keep to my go-to rules: business to business only, subscription price/value starting at $49 a month. While in fact, coworking spaces are businesses, lots of them are struggling to make ends meet. Also, really important is, if you start in an industry with a lot of competition, make sure your product does one thing really well. Don't spread yourself too thin by having many similar features but average executed. And the last thing—something I always struggled with—was to sell the product. Problem with many bootstrappers, makers, and creators are that they think their product sells itself. No, it won't. Running a business is 20% product and 80% marketing. The problem is to most people marketing or sales is seen a sleazy or dirty. But if you look at the most successful companies out there, you see their biggest marketing ""trick"" is providing (future) customers with free, useful and helpful content or resources. One advises I keep to, now too for Muna, is having a post-product-launch plan. This is simply things to do after you have done ""the launch""—in quotes because there will be many little launches over time. It includes blog posts to write, a list of people to contact and other things to keep the momentum going. ‍"," At first, I really tried to leverage my network. Simply (cold) emails. I also wrote some blogs writing about small pains coworking might have: setup an environment to boost productivity, how to focus on the community aspect, etc. I had a product tour video created to more easily explain how easy the product was to use. But I didn't push any of these strategies hard enough. For all of them, I did the bare minimum. I did not continue writing useful content. I did not follow up on emails and saw no reply as no interest. Though the blog posts generated page visits, only a really small percentage created an account. You know this is to be expected, but it still sucked all the joy out of working on it more."," I like to keep a low-profile online and in general. I personally don't use any social media, nor do I keep a personal blog. I plan to write some blogs for Muna. Giving some insights and things I learn along the way of building a new business (which has already a higher revenue than Muun!). You also can get updates via Twitter at @munahq_. And am always happy to help with any business-related thing, marketing or UI design whenever I can just send an email to eelco@munahq.com."," I think there are too many resources out there telling you ""how to do X"". So many get hung up on this and read too much, while not doing any actual work. I try to be really pragmatic about this and only read or learn about a certain topic when I have a need for it. I otherwise like to talk to entrepreneurs, product managers or other experts over a cup of coffee. With all the traveling I do, I am fortunate to meet many. I learn the most from these interactions. ‍"," Muun 1, or the first iteration, made exactly $0. There were people trialing but never continued using it. It did cost me a minimal amount of hosting (Heroku, S3, etc.). The costs of my time developing, designing, writing, and market, full-time for a month, would translate easily into a five-figure amount (if it was a consultancy gig). Muun 2, or the second iteration, took way less, by removing way more and also making way more. The total recurring amount was at its peak around $200. But that was a peak and did not continue (high churn—yikes!). This is all part of building businesses and all costs were covered by having another business. The second ""pivot"" is something I just launched, called Muna. It's actually a completely new product. It will have some of the features of Muun but geared towards the next generation companies and teams.",Software & Hardware,Bad Marketing,Netherlands,"June 24, 2018",Eelco,https://www.failory.com/interview/muun,"['https://www.munahq.com/', 'https://twitter.com/munahq_', 'mailto:eelco@munahq.com']",failure,0,,"Eelco built Muun in his own, a SaaS that allowed co-working spaces owners to run their businesses effectively.

154,my-auto-shop," Hi, I’m Andy. I was raised in Auckland, before heading off to chase winters all over the world, throwing myself off jumps and down half-pipes. Whilst I’m now back in the city (and able to get a tan again), the enthusiasm for trying something new, and a little crazy, hasn’t disappeared. I’m an ‘off the chart’ extrovert who loves meeting and working with new people. I’ve just tipped over the hill to 30, and live back in Auckland, trying to get out as much as possible on the weekends whether that is exploring our country’s beautiful backyard, or catching a surf on the West Coast.  I’ve since branched out to start my own technology marketplace business, My Auto Shop. We’re reimagining how car maintenance is done in NZ by partnering with fully vetted, MTA approved garages and we make it easy to find, compare, and book the best mechanic for customers around New Zealand. We’ve essentially become the ‘Airbnb for car maintenance and repairs’ and a really easy way for Kiwi’s to sort out the hassles of getting their car repaired or serviced.  Through My Auto Shop, you can schedule what maintenance you’re needing, pick a workshop that suits you based on reviews, receive the price upfront, and then schedule a pick up for your car by an independent, E-Scooter wielding, driver from wherever suits you. ‍",," It’s pretty clear that coronavirus has presented the biggest challenge for our journey so far, but we are learning to navigate it. It really forced us to make hard decisions quickly to best position ourselves to get through the crisis and have a business that can succeed in a recessionary environment. The big decision was transitioning our business model from an UberEats-style model to a more Airbnb-inspired model - helping customers seeking value not convenience.  What I mean by that is our original value proposition was driven by the ‘we can pick up your car for you so you don’t have to visit the garage’.  Now it’s driven by ‘we’ve vetted these garages so you can trust you’re getting value for money’. That’s got more longevity in the current environment where customers are watching their cash a bit more closely. We still want to offer pick-up but there’s a bit of a question mark over the wanted-ness of that service, and whether people will be willing to pay for it. ‍",," We’re obviously still pretty new, only operating for about 11 months, so still really scrappy, but feel we have a pretty good handle on what customers want and how a car actually works! The team is really growing into their own. Myself and a team of young weapons from Auckland Uni. While 2020 was about testing, learning, and finding product/market fit, 2021 is about putting the foot down and kick-starting a big growth curve for us. We are looking to raise some money shortly and will grow the team, foot print, and offering. Should be fun. We want to be the one-stop-shop for everything car, therefore we have a long journey with many features & projects ahead of us. In the short term, we have a focus on making a complex process digesting all the different jobs people may need done, and turning it into a really easy UX for customers. On the side, I am a big believer in a balanced lifestyle, so I’ve set myself a bit of a personal challenge to build a successful, hyper-growth tech company, without sacrificing the rest of my life. This means running in the mornings, spending time with friends and family in the evenings, and weekends away from the computer. While the typical startup narrative is a ‘non-stop hustle’, I want to prove that otherwise.",," The concept of My Auto Shop started in October 2019, and through a couple of months of research and iteration, we landed on a prototype that was a similar business model, but had more of a primary focus on an ‘Uber’ delivery experience of customer’s cars using e-scooters. We wanted to push that live and then ‘learn as we go’. This was built quickly by a friendly development agency and pushed live in January 2020.  In my experience, it’s important that before anything launches, you understand the macro environment of where your business is going to sit. What are the customer demographics like? What are their purchasing habits? What does the vehicle market look like in New Zealand? What’s your TAM? etc. However, we wanted to get our hands dirty ASAP so we jumped in head first pretty quickly. We intentionally launched in a quiet time so we could figure out our operational processes. Unfortunately, (or fortunately) we landed on the national newspaper and suddenly had jobs coming through, which led to a frantic couple of weeks. Once we got our feet under us we started moving well, only to be hit with COVID lockdowns next. We’ve only just been in a position to really focus on growth in recent months.  ‍",," After chasing winters around the world competing and running my own coaching businesses, I moved back to Auckland. There I spent time in a couple of sales roles with Frontside Media and Facebook, before becoming one of the team to start Uber in NZ. I held roles in marketing and operations in both NZ and Singapore at Uber, then finally as Country Manager for Uber Eats New Zealand until October 2019. After Uber reached a stable state in New Zealand, it began to consolidate operations and the New Zealand team didn’t have the punch it used to. This provided the opportunity for me to try my hand out on my own, and from my time working with many drivers at Uber, I saw car maintenance as an industry really behind the times in its digital progression. Before building My Auto Shop, I went through a period exploring many different business ideas, mainly in the Future of Food and Future of Workspace (what I knew). However, it was clear to me that there was already so much money being pumped into both of the spaces (i.e they were too sexy) meaning fiercely competitive and often over-funded. I wanted to look elsewhere, into maybe a slightly smaller market, but one without all the attention: car maintenance. In the last ten to twenty years, we’ve seen a massive advancement in technology in cars.  This corresponded with new generations generally becoming much less practical which has resulted in a huge gap of knowledge between a mechanic and a customer. Unfortunately, some mechanics have taken advantage of that gap.  Mechanics have been rated as some of society’s ‘least trusted people’ alongside used car salesmen and real estate agents. As you generally can’t work out your car’s problem yourself, you don’t know where to get your parts from, and you don’t know if the mechanic has fixed the issues until you’ve paid and driven away, you need to trust what they say and assume the price is fair. This makes for a pretty lopsided transaction. Auto repair is such a fragmented industry in New Zealand with 4600 independent garages, working on about 10 cars a day. They’re just trying to keep their heads above water, so no one has the capacity to rethink the industry. COVID definitely threw a spanner into the mix, and it did for us all across New Zealand. The business model of My Auto Shop changed a lot through the pains of lockdowns. We went from primarily an ‘Uber-style’ model for car maintenance with a team of drivers who used scooters to pick up and drop off people’s customers, but we transitioned into more of a booking platform for car maintenance. We learned heaps in the first few months.  But then of course COVID hit and we had to reassess what we were doing.  Throughout the lockdown, we decided to double down on the parts we can solve quickly - upfront pricing and trustworthiness We’re coming up to a year of the business existing, and we’ve learned and adapted a lot, but there's more to come."," As touched on above, a big lesson for me is understanding the importance of work-life balance. My sense of fulfillment or satisfaction in life is derived from a variety of different experiences and learnings, with a career only playing a minor role in that equation, therefore if I get all consumed in work, I won’t be happier, even if my career gets ‘better’. However, I think there are peaks and troughs. Times when you need to lean into work, and others when you lean out of it. So it’s ok to sometimes focus on a career goal, work huge hours and sacrifice other things, but that can’t be sustained in a healthy way for long periods of time. Other than that, three other quick-fire thoughts: Situational awareness is really important. Be aware of what’s going on in other people's lives, how it affects their perception and in turn, you can change how your message is received. The second is to build your business with a team. Another three to four people in your corner makes the hard times much easier. Many hands make light work :) And the third would be to test and learn in the market. Build an MVP, test that your assumptions around what problem you’re solving are correct, and go from there. And get your own data - don’t double down on previous assumptions by taking someone else’s data at face value. ‍"," As we are a marketplace business, we need to grow both sides in tandem for the business to work nicely. Without garages, we don’t have anywhere for our customers to go, but without customers, we don’t have much value to garages.  Starting with garage side growth, we’ve had to keep it old school. A big aspect of our growth has been picking up the phone, sending letters in the post but nothing seems to work better than just walking into a garage and having a face to face conversation.  With the increase in e-commerce through COVID, we know we’re in a great position to provide the best digital solution. This is where our focus lies being a digital business. The plan is to ‘Win the Internet’, to win the customer. Pre-COVID, our marketing strategy was pretty bare in all honesty, our focus was growing the marketplace in terms of supply first of garages, rather than demand from customers. But COVID allowed us to grow our network size, as we could build on the narrative of helping garages get more work in their doors as the current economy puts a squeeze on their own customer base. We’ve really started to see some traction in the last couple of months, just as we’re beginning to better define our GTM strategy. It obviously feels great that there’s validation from New Zealand customers as they use our service, but there’s still plenty of work still to be done. ‍"," Feel free to check out what we’ve built at My Auto Shop.

I was one of the three co-founders and didn’t have a title since I thought calling myself the CEO in a five-person company (our peak at some point) is such a brag. I was “doing-everything-I-could-officer.” Although mostly I was responsible for the product, marketing, and sales. And I don’t write code. Fortunately, my two other co-founders took care of that. ‍"," There wasn’t any major turning point when “things went wrong.” We couldn’t scale, and at first, we didn’t even know how to approach growth. We didn’t have any experience in it, and we were making silly mistakes.  One of those mistakes was not paying attention to metrics. We had an interview with one major US-based startup accelerator, and they asked us: “How do you measure success for your clients?”. I was blown away by that question. Somehow it never even crossed our minds to come up with any success metric. We were selling the platform and didn’t put much thought into how to measure that.  The other thing we didn’t pay much attention to was talking to our customers. We talked a lot to those who paid for our platform, but we didn’t do much customer research. We never had any significant insights and simply following our instincts.    I firmly believe that to succeed with your company you need to have three key things:  Product (something that provides real value)Market (group of people who would pay for your product)Team (group of people who would make the product great) And when startups fail, they usually lack one or two (or sometimes even three) of these things. I think for us, it was mostly somewhere between product and market.   You see, to use MyCity, governments would need to get creative and create within themselves a new process on how to work with the feedback they’d received. Usually, when a company buys software, it helps them improve their existing process (e.g., run payroll operations, pick contractors, schedule interviews, that kind of thing). But if a company buys software and then has to figure out how to implement a new process for that software – something is wrong.   When we tried to sell MyCity, we realized that none of the municipalities have a process of working with incoming feedback. It does for reporting problems (e.g., potholes, drainage, etc.) but not for new ideas. So basically, we created a product for the non-existed market.  As of shutting down, there wasn’t a day when we closed our doors. Our energy to push the company vanished gradually.",,,,," The first version of MyMurmansk (the original website that laid out the foundation for MyCity) was built by my co-founder Dennis in just two nights, even though the idea came nine months earlier. At first, no one from our three-person team had time to build it. Everyone was busy with their day jobs, and it was supposed to be just a side project for fun. Then we hired a student to build it to our specifications, but he didn’t do a good job. Then we sort of just forgot about it and moved on with our lives. Until one day in March. Dennis just wrote to me one morning: hey, I sort of lost faith in hiring anyone to make that website, so I just built it myself last night. Take a look. My reaction was: 😍 That was exactly what we wanted. I immediately started preparing a press release, thinking about how we can promote it. Two days later, we launched MyMurmansk. And then the roller coaster began."," When we transformed MyMurmansk (community-organized movement) into MyCity (commercial product), we didn’t know anything about making government sales. Just some assumptions.   One of those was building demand from the bottom up. We thought that we could let regular citizens create websites on MyCity in their town for free. They will do all the work of creating momentum and building up pressure for local governments to get involved. Then the authorities took notice, and we would provide them with access to analytics, comments, and other premium admin features. That didn’t work at all. It might have worked in the private sector but not in government.  What worked and led us to our first few sales was just regular old-fashioned direct sales. I met with a lady who worked for the urban planning department of Tromsø (Norway) at one conference, our product happened to be precisely what she was looking for, and in several months we launched our first version in Tromsø. "," Before MyCity, I was working in the advertising business as a digital producer. I was building websites, apps, and digital experiences for big brands such as McDonald’s, MasterCard, P&G, and many more. At some point, I lost faith in advertising to make meaningful products and went on an accidental sabbatical (at that time, I didn’t even know it was a thing). Then I met Dennis, my co-founder, and we started tinkering with some ideas around improving our city through technology. It was back in 2012, and that space was beginning to see the first players to appear. In 2013 we came up with the idea to put a giant map of our city online and let anyone add any ideas about improving the city. We called it MyMurmansk, and in the first 48 hours, we collected almost 200 ideas. In a couple of months, the word started to spread about this website in Murmansk. We began to receive requests to build the same in other cities. This is where everything started. We decided to create a platform out of it and try to sell it to local governments. We called it MyCity, rolled up our sleeves, and got to work to make it happen. ‍"," Two key things: I would put much more thought into talking to customers. We relied a lot on our intuition, and it was simple in terms of building features for citizens, but regarding features for governments, we couldn’t guess it right. That seems so obvious now, but we were too focused on nailing the citizens’ side of our product that we forgot about talking to actual clients.Pick key north star metrics from day one. That would make it so much easier to focus on the right initiatives, solve any internal debates, see our client’s success and our progress. These two things are about internal processes, but I believe these are a crucial part of any company building. In terms of strategy, business model, specific features, and more tangible things, I think it’s more important to change process and mindset, and the right plan and ideas would come. We had to change not what we were doing but mostly how we were doing it. ‍",, You can read more about the story of MyCity in this blog post I published in 2017. And you can follow me on Twitter.," If I were to choose only one, I would most definitely pick Paul Graham’s blog. I strongly recommend reading all of it. Forget about those books on hard skills and stuff like that. Your soft skills and mindset would benefit greatly from reading his writing. "," We didn’t have many assets, and all of the people on the team were working for free, so basically, we were paying hard dollars only for hosting, maintenance, and some travel expenses for sales pitches. Expenses were pretty low. We did get some revenue (made few sales). We made three one-time sales in a total of between €20,000 – €30,000. ‍",Software & Hardware,No Market Need,Russia,"June 29, 2021",Stepa Mitaki,https://www.failory.com/interview/mycity,"['https://medium.com/@stepamitaki/lessons-i-learned-when-building-civic-tech-startup-744239d6dc84', 'https://twitter.com/stepamitaki']",failure,0,,"Stepa co-founded MyCity, a tool for local authorities to build relationships with their residents.

156,narcine," I’m Ognyan, 32, Industrial Designer, Engineer and Entrepreneur from Sofia, Bulgaria. I believe that in the 21st century you don’t need a two-ton machine to transport a single passenger in the city. Small, personal vehicles are cheap, fun and super versatile. They can turn tedious commuting into an adventure!   Precisely for this reason, we decided to build the best micro-vehicle out there. In short - Narcine gives you the style & comfort of a large scooter in half the size of a bicycle. You can ride and store it practically anywhere.  I’m the founder and CEO of the company. I’m preparing a crowd-funding campaign at the moment (B2C sales) as well as developing a scooter-sharing business model.  ",," The biggest challenge is trying to transition from a hobby project to a profitable business. Everyone who has experienced this inevitably has been at the point of trying to balance his daily job with the evermore time-consuming startup. To me, it feels like trying to juggle while climbing stairs - you have to concentrate really hard for really long stretches of time to make this work. Especially, when talking about a hardware startup the challenges can be tremendous - just the number of areas in which the founders should have expertise is imposing: Industrial Design, Engineering,  Manufacturing, Marketing, Finance, Business administration, Law and Shipping are just some of those. (in our case we could add - physics and vehicle handling/design)Of course, when it comes to challenges it all comes to how committed and how well connected you are. Big thanks to all the people that helped us with the project :)  Our larger mistake - not starting with the customer in mind. Every startup should start with a precise idea of who their customer is and what value they bring to them (what problem they solve).  Another rookie mistake - trying to build a product the satisfies everyone. Feedback is great, but not every feedback should prompt you to change your idea or start adding features. Building Minimum Viable Product is key here - the minimal subset of features that is sufficient to solve the customer’s problem. Sticking with the three-wheel configuration was the most time-consuming mistake we made. It’s more expensive, not as nice to drive and we were not even sure why we came up with it in the first place.  Always, make a specification sheet, before trying to make hardware product and stick to it - no unnecessary features.   ‍",," We’re preparing an Indiegogo campaign which will launch in April. We’re planning to sell at least 100 units through the campaign and create our sales/marketing network in Europe.  We’re also actively looking for investors to come on board and help us develop a scooter-sharing network. This business model has proven to be extremely profitable and has also delivered great value to customers, providing them with a viable alternative for urban commuting.  We want to expand our portfolio with different models, customization options and finding new partners and retailers.  A personal goal I have is to educate people in Bulgaria about the benefits that personal mobility provides to city life - I’m not talking only about scooters. Bicycles and even plain walking can have a huge impact on city life.  ",," The project began in 2016. We did some typical rookie startup mistakes by not analyzing the market, competitors and customer problems first. “Make it cool, and they will come” - was our philosophy at the time.  The first model was made literally made out of cardboard, we used it just to check size and proportions. Thanks to a great partner-company in Plovdiv we then we manufactured a real, working prototype from sheet aluminum. The feeling of actually riding your creation for the first time is indescribable! This model was three-wheeled with tiny wheels and a rough seat. We spent more than two years of improving it, testing with customers and following their feedback. In the middle of 2018, we abandoned the three-wheel configuration, for a simpler and more reliable two wheels. Already we had a few early customers and growing fan-base.  Concerning pricing - our product is slightly different from competitors’ (maybe even resegmenting this market). We know that there are cheaper models out there but we think it won’t be the deciding factor for the people who praise the value of Narcine.  ‍",," I’m an engineer and industrial designer. I graduated my master degree in Milano, Italy - having worked on projects for Audi and Lamborghini.  Since then, I’ve lived and worked in Sofia and observed this city’s life in all its aspects. I saw how much time I lose daily in commuting and how frustrating this could be - my strongest motivator to start working on a better solution.  We started Narcine as a project for the spare time, just a couple of friends and me. We had many ideas, little time and no money - so we built two super-low fidelity prototypes just to check the dimensions and viability. Over time I got obsessed with the idea of building and improving the prototypes until the final model was ready in 2019.  "," I would learn to plan better - planning is the key, as well as connecting with people that can help you out (and that believe in what you do). Nobody can succeed in a complex project on his own.  ‍"," We’re only just getting starting to get traction. We have a few early adopters - from our experience, especially with this type of hardware product, live demos work best. People like to touch, feel and get to test the scooter and we get to have invaluable feedback from them and to enjoy seeing their reaction when riding for the first time. We’ve organized more than ten test-drive events and taken part in quite a few startup competitions and exhibitions in the field of technology and innovations:       -    Two editions of Webit festival.

157,ne-lounge," Hey! I’m Jake Lang, born and raised in New Hampshire. I’m 28 years old, I now live in Massachusetts with my fiancée Brooke (we’re getting married in June 2020) and our two Great Danes Miley and Charlie. I build online businesses, it’s what I love doing. I love looking for a niche, finding an opportunity, and delivering a solution to an underserved market. I’ve started six online businesses ranging from online courses to membership sites, and I have a top-selling book on Amazon for my niche.  My big project now is to continue building businesses. I will be starting two new businesses this year and sharing my journey at The Entrepreneur Ride Along where I’ll share the ups, downs, wins, and mistakes of building each business. But that’s not what I’m here to talk about… Today I’m here to talk about my biggest failure as an entrepreneur. I like to call it my $16,000 learning lesson (AKA a $16,000 loss). That failure came in 2017 when I was launching my Amazon FBA business. The business that I called “NE Lounge”. It was supposed to have a dual meaning standing for “New England” lounger or lounge “Anywhere”. Get it, the letters “N-E” pronounced sounds like “Any”? Yeah, a stupid name that no one else understood either. But that doesn’t matter! Don’t let the name of your business hold you back from moving forward, you can always re-brand later. Anyways. I was launching an Amazon FBA product. I was the founder and sole proprietor of NE Lounge, which was intended to be an Amazon FBA store selling inflatable products. My first product was an inflatable lounger, the NE Lounge Inflatable Lounger. You can see inflatable loungers on Amazon. It’s a bit of a fad product. It’s essentially an inflatable couch. You hold the lounger and run to fill it up with air, then tie it closed and you have a big inflatable pouch to lounge on great for camping or hanging at the beach. I had big goals for this product. I did lots of market research, I saw what was wrong with the competition. My plan was to come in and sell a premium inflatable lounger, one that was bigger, more durable, and stayed inflated longer. I would price myself on the high end of the competition, I would charge $50 per lounger when most of the competition charged $20 to $40 per lounger. At about $20 cost per item, and charging $50 per sale, I would profit $30 per each inflatable lounger that I sold. If I could sell just 100 per month (around 3 units per day) I would net $3,000 profit per month. Combined with the revenue I was generating from my other online businesses, which was around $7,000 per month, with this new Amazon FBA business I’d be able to hit my income goal of $10,000 per month. I told myself, if I generated $10,000 per month from my online businesses, I could comfortably leave my day job and pursue my dream of full-time entrepreneurship. Well, that was the goal at least… ‍"," In the end, it came down to profit. I just could not turn a profit. No matter what I did. My marketing effort, trying to rank for my keywords on Amazon, was not working. No matter how many 5-star reviews I got, and no matter how many discounted items I sold, my Best Seller Ranking was not climbing fast enough to rank on the first page of Amazon. I was in over my head. I chose an expensive product ($20 per unit), I was trying to sell at a premium price ($50 per unit) but no one was buying. The only buyers I was getting were the people buying through JumpSend at a 50% discount. After Amazon fees, I was taking a loss on those JumpSend sales and it wasn’t even helping my organic ranking! In the end, I sold more inflatable loungers at a discounted rate through JumpSend then I sold organically at full price. I was essentially paying money for people to take these inflatable loungers from me. After accounting for the initial investment, marketing fees, Amazon storage fees, Amazon sales fees, JungleScout fees, professional photography, and graphic design the end result after selling 500 units of NE Lounger inflatable loungers was a loss of $16,000. I shut the business down in April 2018 after selling all 500 units (for a loss). The nail in the coffin came when I brought the dilemma to my mastermind group, a group of entrepreneurs I trusted and had been meeting with on a weekly basis for over two years. I asked them if I should re-order more inventory to try and turn a profit, or cut my ties and walk away. I got a lot of great feedback from an outside perspective it was eye-opening. The choices were clear, spend another $16,000 and maybe turn a profit or double down on my other online businesses and scale those to reach my goal of $10,000 income per month. It was an easy decision. In the end, I decided not to re-order the next round of inventory. I shut down NE Lounge and walked away with a $16,000 learning lesson. I can point to a number of reasons why this business failed. First, I suffer from shiny object syndrome. I jumped in too quick after just learning how to launch an Amazon FBA product. I saw the profit potentials, and I was really pushing myself to generate a little extra money so I could leave my 9-5 job and pursue entrepreneurship full time. I chased the shiny object when I could have doubled down and scaled my successful businesses. Second, I chose the wrong product. I chose an expensive product to manufacture, one with lots of competition, one that is known to break (and get bad reviews), one that is a fad product that I had never personally used or even heard of before researching niches on Amazon. I should have chosen a simpler item for my first FBA product, one that was less costly and cheaper to manufacture on a per-unit basis. I was in trouble right off the bat when I dropped over $10,000 just to manufacture my inflatable lounger. I put myself in a hole from the beginning. I should have started smaller, and started cheaper for my first attempt. It would have softened the blow of this failure. Third, I didn’t fully understand Amazon. This was my first Amazon product. I didn’t understand the fees, I was learning about manufacturing, I didn’t understand importing, and I didn’t realize how hard it was to rank a product organically on the Amazon search platform. In hindsight, there are hundreds of reasons why NE Lounge failed. I am the first to admit, I jumped into this business too quickly. I should have done more research I should have slowed down. I should have re-evaluated my options, weighed the pros vs. cons, and conducted a better cost-benefit analysis before launching NE Lounge. It was a good idea, I did my research talking to customers, and I entered the market with a better product that met the needs of the target market. But I needed to slow down, take a step back, and re-evaluate the risk of starting a new business on Amazon, a platform that I was unfamiliar with. ",,,,," The Million Dollar Case Study from JungleScout laid out the Amazon FBA process with extremely simple step by step instructions. I followed along each step of their process to launch my product on Amazon. The research started in May 2017, after I had discovered JungleScout. I used the JungleScout Amazon analysis tools for my research. I was on the lookout for an underserved market. I was looking for a niche on Amazon that had good organic search volume, good sales volume, and poor competition. I narrowed it down to a few options including slime storage jars, hanging wall file folders, inflatable limbo games, inflatable pineapple pool floats, and inflatable loungers. In my research, I found that each of these niches were underserved. Each had good sales, but there was barely any competition that stood out with good reviews and a great product. I decided to launch my Amazon business in the inflatables niche. Starting with inflatable loungers, then moving on to inflatable pool floats and inflatable games. I chose the inflatable lounger to start. I chose the lounger because, in my research, I found that the top ten results on Amazon for the search term “inflatable lounger”, each competitor was generating over 300 sales per month. Some up to 2,000 sales per month. I knew that, if I could rank my inflatable lounger product within the top ten search results, I could provide a better product and generate at least 300 sales per month (equal to $9,000 monthly income!). In addition, when I researched the competition, most of the other inflatable loungers sold on Amazon had bad reviews (3 stars or less). Plus, most of my competitors had less than 20 reviews in total. I knew if I could enter the niche, get more reviews than my competitors, and ramp up my sales quickly then my product would stick in the top ten search results for “inflatable lounger” on Amazon and the passive income would roll in every single month. Once I found my niche, I researched how I could improve the inflatable lounger to deliver a better product to my target market. In my competitive research, I found most of the bad reviews for inflatable loungers were a result of poor durability, difficulty of inflating, and comfort. My competitors were selling cheap products. The loungers would break easily, they were hard to inflate, they didn’t hold air longer than 30 minutes, and they just weren’t comfortable. After doing more market research and talking to consumers, I found my differentiator. I would enter the inflatable lounger market with a premium product. My lounger would be designed with a square head shape (more comfortable), it would be the widest and longest lounger on the market, I would use a premium 210T Nano Nylon (more durable), I would use a single mouth design (easier to inflate), and it would have a stronger clamp to keep the lounger inflated longer. Through June and July 2017, I spent my time endlessly researching manufacturers and testing samples. I talked to hundreds of manufacturers on Alibaba until I found the perfect partner based in China. We worked together to custom design my lounger. A lounger that was durable, lightweight, more comfortable, and easier to inflate.   In August of 2017, after spending almost three months testing samples and talking to manufacturers, I placed my order for 500 units of my custom-designed inflatable lounger. While my inventory was being shipped overseas to the Amazon warehouse in the United States, I worked on the Amazon listing and began to kick off my marketing efforts. I worked with a professional photographer to produce product photos with models using my inflatable lounger. These photos would be used in my Amazon listing. I created a website for NE Lounge, and started driving traffic to the website to let everyone know that a better lounger was coming soon. I had professional videos created to show how to use and inflate the lounger. I had a product insert designed that would be packaged with my lounger, this included instructions on how to use the lounger and information about NE Lounge (for marketing purposes). I found the keywords I would target with my Amazon listing. I would start with the terms Inflatable Lounger, air chair, inflatable chairs, and wind chair. These keywords had a great search volume on Amazon. If my Inflatable Lounger showed up on the first page of Amazon when people searched these terms, I would get sales. I created my Amazon listing title, with my keywords mixed in. The title I chose was: Inflatable Lounger Chair | Premium Inflatable Lounger by NE Lounge | Quick and Easy Inflatable Air Chairs | Run 10 Steps to Fully Inflate | Perfect Inflatable Chairs for Festivals and Beach Lastly, I finalized the rest of my Amazon listing with a detailed description and five bullet points that defined my value proposition: EASY INFLATEQUALITY DESIGNCOMFORTABLE INFLATABLE LOUNGERDURABLE & LIGHTWEIGHT100% MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE By September 2017, my first round of inventory reached the Amazon warehouses. Just a few days later, I officially launched NE Lounge. A few days after that, I got my first sale.",," I love starting online businesses, and I love finding new opportunities to make money online. At the time, I had two successful online businesses up and running. AssociatePI, a website selling online courses in the insurance industry generating around $5,000 in monthly passive income. And Pomsky Owners Association, a blog generating around $750 in passive income. I just needed a little more income per month to comfortably quit my 9-5 job and pursue entrepreneurship full time. My goal was to generate $10,000 in income per month, that would give me a nice safety net to quit my cushy job as a financial analyst. I was on the lookout for new opportunities when I stumbled upon Greg Mercer of JungleScout and the Million Dollar Case Study. It’s a case study going through the process of manufacturing a physical product and launching it through the Amazon FBA program to generate $1 Million in revenue. I was always interested in the Amazon FBA program, but I had never seen how simple it was to get started until I came across the Million Dollar Case Study. I was hooked. The allure of launching a new business, one that could generate thousands of dollars in extra income each month drew me in. I followed the instructions from the Million Dollar Case Study step by step to find my niche and launch my product through Amazon FBA. ‍"," If I could go back to May 2017 and talk to my younger self, I’d tell myself to slow down. I’d tell myself to look at what you’ve already built. Don’t rush to meet your goal of $10,000 income per month, and don’t jump in too quickly. It’s a snowball effect, all this effort you are putting into your current businesses will pay off. Keep doing what you are doing, don’t get discouraged, don’t chase the next shiny object. And ask yourself, is Amazon FBA your strong suit? Or should you stick to your profitable online businesses? What’s the risk of starting an FBA business? Is now the right time, or should you save Amazon FBA for another time? If I could start over, I would choose a different product to launch my first Amazon FBA store. I was in the wrong market for myself, one that I was not familiar with. It was a great learning lesson and a very expensive learning lesson at that. I will be back I will launch another Amazon FBA product. But this time, I know what not to do.  ‍"," My primary strategy was to rank in the top ten search results on Amazon for my targeted keywords. Terms like “inflatable lounger” and “air chair” were being searched thousands of times per day.  The problem is, the way Amazon works, to get a better ranking you need to sell more units. It’s based on the Amazon Best Seller Rank. It’s a formula based on how many items you sell over a period of time, the more you sell in less time, the better your Best Seller Rank. The better your Best Seller Rank, the higher you will climb in the rankings on Amazon. So, to start, I was using JumpSend. It’s a tool that helps you run a marketing campaign off of Amazon to get sales quickly and improve your Best Seller Ranking. To use JumpSend, you sell your product at an extremely discounted price. Usually 50% to 75% off. JumpSend will send your discounted offer to their list of subscribers to get you a bunch of sales quickly (though you take a loss on the sale). JumpSend also sets up an automated email campaign, so everyone that bought your Amazon product will receive an email asking them to leave a review. This combination of getting sales quickly, and getting 5-star reviews, will bump your ranking into the top ten search results. I also used paid advertising on Amazon. I paid $15 per day for Amazon to display my product on the front page for my keywords. Additionally, I was running a website for NE Lounge. I was driving traffic to the website and producing content with the goal of driving more traffic to my Amazon listing.  ‍"," Things have turned around a bit since 2017!

In total, I closed this business at a loss of $16,000 after twelve months of work. The costs added up quickly.

158,nerdpilots," Hey there! My name is Kevin Pereira and I am the founder of NerdPilots. But my entrepreneurial journey didn’t start with NerdPilots. During the last few years, I have built multiple businesses on different industries. One of the first ones was a house cleaning company based in San Jose, California, which turned to be pretty big and I sold it. It is called InstaMaids (it’s still up right now) and they about a million dollars per year. After this, I decided to go on vacation for a little bit until my business partner, Rohan, and I started a company called Wet Shave Club, a pretty big wet shaving goodies subscription box company. We had around two thousand members paying us like $30 a month. The most that we did with that company was $100,000 in December of 2014 or 2015. Then, I started a SAS company called GrooveJar, which I successfully sold.

Another of my businesses that is great to mention is Convert27, a powerful marketing software for local businesses that is mostly used by Launch27’s users right now. And we have the objective of including some more products into Launch27 software. Launch27 and TripLaunch are making thirty thousand dollars per month and Convert27 is doing over three thousand dollars a month right now (but that's going to be growing in a small period of time). And finally, I run NerdPilots, which generates somewhere between 15 to 25 thousand dollars a month right now, but our goal by the end of 2019 is to get it into a $100,000/month. So that's where I am at and that's pretty much what I'm working on. I have a couple of other projects, such as a website that I'm going to be starting up soon for where I will sell aviation-related things and maybe one or two other SaaS. I run all these businesses living in Big Bear Lake, California, a little mountain community about two hours from Los Angeles. But let’s move into NerdPilots. As I've built so many different products and websites, people have been always asking me to use my designers and developers. So, I thought: “let's create a little agency where people can get a website built or if they have any website issues, they can come to us and we'll fix it.” ‍",," The biggest challenge is managing clients you work with – there are a lot of different personalities and different expectations. In order to manage these expectations, we now have a contract signed by every client so they know what to expect from us and to protect us from complaints. I tend to reject customers – I now just feel what kind of client they're going to be and if they're not very responsive.  One of the worst things that happened to NerdPilots was with a bad developer who was managing a lot of clients but suddenly stopped being available. It has been a big issue over the last couple of months as we had to move his work over to new developers. But as far as disadvantages, I don't really think we have any. We have also committed a few mistakes starting projects or waiting for clients to deliver us needed information for a long time, which has meant losing some clients. We're working right now on trying to make sure the clients have the same expectations that we have. ‍",," What we're working on right now on the agency and which we hope to release in two or three weeks is a new version of the backend of the site (which we're probably going to turn it into a SAS company as well). This idea of this back end is to solve a problem with today’s agencies: When you need something to be built by them, you have to email them to get stuff done. And it's not very efficient. So, what we're going to be building is basically a platform similar to UpWork where clients would create a job post telling what they need. They would basically log it, post the job (I need a website, I need this bug to be fixed, etc.), get a quote and the agency starts working. Clients wouldn’t have to hire anybody as the agency team would be the one in charge of the development. It's just a way to be much more organized and streamline the whole process. When we first started NerdPilots, I went with a subscription model where, for 69 dollars a month, customers got two hours of work per month. But soon we found that people's needs varied a lot. Some people just needed an hour every two months while some people needed almost a full-time developer. That’s why we pivoted to the agency model. But now, what we're trying to build with this new platform is a way for all of these different people to be helped. I believe there are a lot of teams or maybe even bigger agencies which will find this software really useful, not only to manage their clients but to maximize revenues. I spend a lot of time going through a lot of CRMs and different products for agencies, but nobody focuses on the aspect of making easier for the customer the task of asking for jobs to be done. Moreover, if your customers are already signed up on your platform and know that they can request a job in only a few minutes, they will probably come over and over again. So that's our goal with this. Implementing this backend on our agency, but also building a company from it. And in terms of revenue, as I have already said, we want to grow NerdPilots to $100,000/month by the end of 2019, which is a quite ambitious goal as we are in $25,000/month. ‍",," So, the process I take to build all of my projects (including NerdPilots) starts with talking with my main designer and explaining to him what I want to build. Then I send him examples of things that I like from different websites. A couple of days later, he comes with the website design. After this, we spend a couple of days improving it. I ask some of my friends what they think, and then I go to my developer and tell him to code the design into a website. And that's it. We started NerdPilots with the service model. We had a rudimentary back end where people could manage their projects. But soon we moved into the traditional agency model site as I found we had three clients and it was already a mess. Since launching NerdPilots, we completely redesign the homepage. I didn't like the original design that much and we had to remove the SaaS options. When you're doing unlimited design or development, you're looking at a different type of client, such as small agencies with their own clients that need help. But dealing with them was not enjoyable. And we also realized that we were going to spend the same amount of time working to acquire a client that was going to pay us a $100/month versus $50,000 for a project. So, after we got a big $38,000 project, I realized that we have to focus on bigger projects instead of small subscriptions that paid $69/month. Right now, NerdPilots has 12 team members – 1 project manager, 2 designers, 2 assistants and 7 developers. But at the time of launching it only had one team member. I promoted the business on some Facebook groups, but I was limited with how many clients we could take because our back-end wasn't really that great. ‍",," I've always been an entrepreneur. I've always enjoyed having my own business and not having to go to work and to the office every day. So that's a pretty big motivation for me. I enjoy running teams and working with people. And I am always looking for an opportunity. Anywhere there's money to be made I want to try that thing out And I have no problems trying things that I think are going to fail as well, like the aviation website. We're going to be building it, although I believe it is most likely that it’s going to fail. But that's it's not really a big deal. I'm just going to lose a couple thousand dollars and that'll be it. On the other side, I will have lots of new experiences and new knowledge. The first websites that I did were a failure. I didn't really understand a lot of the necessary components of sites, like how to make it nice and how to increase converting customers rate. Wet Shave Club was also a failure as we dissolved it. Even though our revenues were large, it was really difficult to make any profit off it because it was a physical product. As we grew, we had to spend more and more money on more products. It became a huge cash flow issue. This shows that even if your business is successful and generating revenue, it doesn't mean that you're going to succeed. Failure is just a natural thing and I look at it as “I’m just going to try this out and if it works great, but if it doesn't work, it’s also fine.”. One strategy that I have found that is great to avoid failure is to never start a business unless there's another similar business that's successful in the market. Anyway, a lot of people overthink failure and believe a business failure is the end of the world and that everyone's going to be laughing at them. And this is not true. And I want to emphasize that even generating revenue, your business won’t be successful. GrooveJar, for example, was making fifteen hundred dollars a month. That was a great site income, but for me, it wasn't really growing and it was taking me a lot of time with customer support. I also didn’t feel really excited about the project so I just decided to move on. Success is kind of relative and it can really be a lot of different things. But let’s move to NerdPilots. The reason behind the creation of it is that I wanted to see what people's projects were and help them with them. I enjoy the beginning stages of businesses where you have an idea and then it actually becomes like a business that can make money."," If I could take to my form self before NerdPilots, I would tell him to focus on content. I need to create a lot more content. Also, I would tell him to focus on bigger projects instead of smaller ones. ‍"," The best way to get customers has been Craigslist. We just posted on Craigslist every day and we find lots of good clients (and a lot of bad clients as well!). We're working on social media right now, and we're also working on a blog and a big guide. One of the big problems that we see is that when people are coming to us with new projects, there's no standardized format. People rarely have a document together with their ideas or examples ready. That’s why we are working on a guide which is going to help a lot of people when they want to create some software or website putting all of their ideas together presenting them to a developer/development team. We once tried Google AdWords, but we were not able to make it successful. I think that if we try it again in a different way we might have a little luck. ‍"," To learn more, they can check out my websites, NerdPilots, Convert27, TaskJoyy (coming soon) TaskJoyy is going to be a SaaS product of our NerdPilots backend to manage clients and allow them to add projects/tasks, quote them, charge, manage them, etc. To contact me, kevin@nerdpilots.com is best.

159,newco," I used to lead the community on Product Hunt a few years ago and wanted to build my own projects. I sort of fell down into the no-code tools and found out that I could build stuff using them and putting them together so they'll feel, look, and work like real software. From there, I basically created a few projects in a year to test things on my own. Fast forward through those I came to found Makerpad, which is what I'm currently working on. We started in January 2019. It's a learning community, where we teach people how to build software products without needing to code. ‍",," When I launched on Product Hunt, one of the reviews pointed out that this idea is really cool, but the guy is dreadfully dull. During that time I was doing video tutorials. I didn't know what I was doing. I was just recording and trying to follow a script. It's a lot more difficult than people think, a lot more goes into it. I probably wasn't doing enough to make a really good production, but I was seeing where it was going. At that time, I was still in the mindset of every startup has to grow 10% every week and then you go to Y Combinator. Then you get funded by VCs and it's got to become a huge thing. I saw other startups through Indie Hackers that were doing well by themselves growing at a slower pace and I wanted to do it that way. To build the platform, I got a friend of mine, Mubashar Iqbal, who builds tons of things. He's a technical guy and a prolific maker. I wanted to build it in a way that could scale, which was far too early. There was no need to be doing that. “I was chasing what I thought was the right thing rather than listening to what people enjoyed.” Soon enough, I didn't recognize our product as what we were trying to do. I was not really sure what I was selling, how I was selling it, or who I was selling it to. There were some videos, but actually, we got another feature that we were trying companies to sign up for. We were doing too many things at the same time and it became a bit of a mess. After a few months, I felt that I needed to shut it down, as I didn't know what the platform was becoming. “Promising weekly screencasts is a big thing to do and when motivation is down from the slow growth, it can be an even tougher ask!” ‍",,,,," I didn't really know what I was doing. I was just tweeting stuff saying this is a cool thing I built. That was all of it. I can't even remember if there was a community. There probably was a Slack community because most makers had one. I tried posting stuff on Hacker News, which never went anywhere, and stuff on Reddit, where people just shouted at me. But for me, Twitter always seems to be more well-accepted than other platforms. "," I was trying to launch projects on Product Hunt, so when I left I had a project to work on. I tried many ideas and people seemed to be interested but no one actually paid for anything, no one ever bought anything. I found out the interest came with how I was putting these projects together with Typeform, Carrd, and Zapier to make it feel like it was a real service, a real product.   I had like 1500-2000 people on the email list, but no one paid for any of my projects. I went back to the drawing board. I saw some screencasting companies on Indie Hackers like GoRails. They were making $15,000/month. So, why don't I film myself creating stuff, and then people can pay and get access to that? I messaged my email subscribers telling them I was going to do some video tutorials. 15 people paid. I needed to set up a company and I called it newCo because I couldn't think of a name. It was basically a Webflow site with a link to a payment page, which was another Carrd site. When people paid, I emailed them a password which was called ""positivebananas"". You use that to get to the protected page on Webflow and then you get access to the tutorials. ‍"," I did have the chance to start it over with Makerpad. After shutting down newCo, I went away for three months, traveling with my girlfriend to figure out what we were going to do. While traveling, I read the book ""Company of One"" by Paul Jarvis. I learned that there were other people building startups by themselves and had a great living from it. There was something working with newCo. People really liked learning about doing no-code stuff. Assuming that, I kept going with a no-code education service. I launched Makerpad with the same videos I had at newCo. People had to pay for accessing the videos. After looking at what happened with newCo, I learned that you should forget all the platform stuff. I built it myself and that was the easier way for me to service it. ‍  People think a lot about the end goal of what kind of business and don't seem to be realistic about what they're trying to build. Is it a $20,000/month revenue for you and you don't have to manage any employees? That's a great situation to be in. What I thought was if I have 1,000 customers, customer support will be 1,000 times worse than having one customer. And the way I've done things for my customers was to just make sure that it was a fun thing. I got to build new products every day. Some people think that you have to launch something that is really big. That you need to do all these things that don't scale. That you have to talk to people even if you don't like it. “Figure out something that you'd like to do. Keep focusing on that.” ‍",, Here’s a post where I wrote about the story.

160,no-code-founders," I’m JT - based in Edinburgh, Scotland and I’m the founder of No Code Founders, a community of founders using no-code tools to build internet businesses. No Code Founders was initially purely a Slack community, but over time I’ve added more features to our site which now includes founder, startup and tool profiles, jobs, interviews, meetups, deals, etc. and has become a place for people to explore the no-code ecosystem and help them choose the right tools and strategies for their projects. I run the community myself so I wear all of the hats at the moment, including the site development and community management. I’ve put very little effort into marketing so far and it’s just grown organically but I’d like to start doing more of that soon. We have 2 main revenue streams - the first is PRO memberships, which is an upsell of our free memberships. The other is paid partnerships with no-code tools who pay to promote themselves to the community. ‍",,,,"  We’re now getting close to 10,000 members and I’m ready to expand that further. We have a large audience of developers and marketers, but our biggest segment has always been founders and the focus is to spread the no-code message to the next generation of non-technical entrepreneurs.  No Code Founders is a very lean business. The total costs per year are less than $2k and are fixed costs so the profit margins increase with every $ made.  There are many different ways NCF could go. I can see it possibly being acquired in the future as I’ve already turned down 3 acquisition offers this year alone, but I’m equally happy to continue running it on my own. Either way, I’m passionate about the no-code community in general and I want to continue running NCF and evangelizing the power of no-code. In terms of the goals for NCF specifically - I’ve got ideas about where I want to get to in terms of users and revenue, but I need to keep it centered around the community and I try to be led by them as much as possible. I spend more and more time in stats and surveys these days to get a better understanding of how I can make NCF a more supportive environment for our members. The members will always be the primary focus and everything else works around that, so I like to keep my goals fairly fluid.",," I took feedback from the community on the things that would help them out and then built a site around those needs. Initially, the site was just a list of interviews and then I started to add more features over time. The hardest part was picking the right features to build. In some cases, I ended up spending a long time building features that weren’t very popular so I think it’s really important to sniff out the areas that are working and focus on those. The other issue is that the site allows users to add a lot of their content (startups, jobs, posts, meetups, etc.). After a while, the site had thousands of dynamically created pages, some with poor-quality data which I’ve had to tidy up manually. That took a lot of time so it would have been better if I had a system in place to manage that from the start. I think that’s an important consideration when starting some type of community platform. The site is purely built on Bubble and uses Zapier for a couple of automations and Mailerlite for the newsletter. In terms of how long it took to build, it’s hard to say as I’ve tweaked along the way but I imagine it’s into the “thousands” of hours now. ",," I’ve had A LOT of failed projects over the years. It took me almost 10 years of making no money online to finally launching my first successful project. After I broke the failure ceiling, I then had 3 projects get acquired in the next 2 years. Before that, I had pivoted from idea to idea, rarely seeing any success but learning at least one thing with each project. Over time, I hit so many pitfalls that I then had a pretty good understanding of what NOT to do and I found that the projects I’ve started since have all been much more successful, by knowing to avoid those same pitfalls. The idea for No Code Founders started as a way to meet people similar to myself. I had discovered a tool called Bubble.io and used it to build a remote job board called Remote Circle, which was later acquired by We Work Remotely. It was through using Bubble that I discovered the no-code movement and realized there was a term used to describe people similar to myself. Up until that point, I felt like a non-techy needle in a haystack of developers. I wanted to meet more of these no-coders and NCF (No Code Founders) was my idea on how to do that. I started it as a Slack group and posted it on a couple of forums. After a couple of weeks, it had 100 members and it grew from there. ‍"," Learn from your members. That’s my biggest takeaway. This is a lesson specifically for community-based businesses, but it’s been a vital one for me. If I started again, I would build a feedback loop directly into the community from the start and follow exactly what our most engaged users wanted. There are subtle differences between different communities and every community is an entirely different beast in terms of how you manage and grow it. Understanding what beast you have is key. And it’s not something you as the founder decide. Entrepreneurs tend to be creative and we have our ideas of what we want to do, but with community building, you need to resist that urge and build what the community want. I’ve had to re-teach myself this lesson over and over with building NCF. ‍","  I’ve done very little in terms of marketing. I’ve got some automated tweets going out every day that share content from the site and other than that, it was just the initial launch on Product Hunt. I’ve tried to focus on engagement rather than growth from the very start and that seems to bring organic growth. Within the first couple of days of launching the Slack channel, I could tell the idea had some level of traction as there was engagement straight away. I didn’t want to ruin that by having a massive influx of new users and taking away the 1-1 relationships that people were building. I’ve done a lot of analysis to understand who the users are. Now that I have a better idea of who the primary users are, I can now start to focus more on marketing efforts and begin to grow the community more rapidly.  I monetized NCF just under a year ago. The revenue split has been about 50/50 since then between PRO memberships (B2C) and paid partnerships (B2B). Memberships have contributed around $20k and that is fully automated as it’s an upsell on the site so I’ve not had to do anything to win those sales. The B2B partnerships most often came from tools reaching out to me directly. I’ve had over 100 no-code platforms enquire about paid partnerships in the past 12 months. As well as this, I’ve done some direct outreach to tools that I thought would be a good fit, and several tools signed up that way too. ‍", You can sign up to nocodefounders.com and I’ll send you a personal welcome message to say hi.

Particularly for early-stage businesses, the speed of development and low running costs make them brilliant choices for quickly launching and validating a business idea. In particular, I’ve used Bubble.io to build most of my projects, including nocodefounders.com. Bubble is very powerful and allows you to visually program almost anything you could with code. As well as building the site functionality for users, I was able to build back-end dashboards for myself that allow me to manage all of my processes, content, and marketing automation, without having any other tools.

161,nogood," My name is Mostafa ElBermawy. I'm the founder and CEO of NoGood, a Growth and Performance Marketing Agency based out of New York City.  I started my life as an archaeologist, but somehow I ended up digging for growth instead of mummies, and now I run a growth marketing agency in addition to running an angel investment fund focused on early-stage SaaS and DTC brands.  ‍",," We really made a ton of mistakes until we found and defined the right attributes a partner should have in order to be a good fit for our business.  Early on, one of the biggest mistakes we made was taking on clients who are trying to scale before they had a clear product-market fit. As a founder, I want to help them, but that led to a lot of frustration for my team. We've become a lot more selective with the clients we bring on and considerably improved at setting and managing expectations with our new clients. We also stopped taking clients that are looking for a single channel to optimize without owning or being able to influence the journey we are sending users into. In addition, we limited the industries and stages of startups or scale-ups to work with. It's really all about the fit for our model so we can maintain the quality of work and retention rate we have always had. ‍",," Despite the challenges of COVID-19, we've continued to expand our agency, adding more and more clients, particularly in the areas of collaboration B2B SaaS, DTC, and healthcare. While gaining new clients and continuing to grow our team are always going to be top priorities, we also want to focus on building our own brand. Our team doubled in size in 2020, and we're hoping to double again in 2021. How do you develop and maintain a company culture while growing a remote team? It's certainly a challenge in the current environment, but one we're excited to work on.",," Having worked in the industry for a while, I knew some people who were experts in various disciplines that could help drive results for our early clients. When we started in 2017, NoGood was 100% remote. Put a team of smart marketers together and they’ll always be able to drive results. However, the whole point of starting NoGood was to build something that was greater than the sum of its parts. This would require more team collaboration, culture, and more refined processes. I made the first hire for the core team in early 2019, and we worked together out of a small office in a WeWork. By the end of the year, we had put together a real team with designers, developers, a data scientist, growth strategists, a few performance managers, and creative designers.  We continued to expand the team in early 2020 as we brought on more clients, but as luck would have it, we’re right back to being remote.",," After I realized hieroglyphics werenʼt paying the bills, I taught myself how to code and started a web design studio after college. I began building websites for clients, but after they started asking me how to drive more users to their sites, I found my personality and traits lean more towards marketing, the intersection of creative communication, engineering, and data analytics.  Growth became a new curiosity of mine, and I eventually joined the Bing team at Microsoft, then the digital experience team at American Express. These roles helped me gain some marketing and growth experience, and I ended up falling in love with that part of the job.  Since then, I've worked for many VC-backed tech startups, including the director of growth marketing at CGS, then working as a growth lead at Harver, a leading startup in the AI recruitment space, as well as Workzone, a project management software startup. All these experiences taught me how to build growth teams from the ground up, design a GTM strategy, and discover the ingredients that drive acquisition or retention growth in a hyper-competitive market. I later became a startup growth advisor for various accelerators and venture funds to help founders define and understand their growth strategy. I quickly realized the limitations of being a solo consultant and the power of being part of a team. As the demand increased, I decided to build the growth team I've always dreamed of when I was in-house, so I started what is now NoGood. ‍"," Many of our biggest lessons have been around defining and maintaining processes. We're all smart marketers who have great ideas and instincts. However, defining our frameworks and staying organized can be challenging, especially as we transitioned from an office to a completely remote team. One example would be our project management. We first started using Monday.com, but the tool just wasn't being utilized, as people began just using their own ""to-do"" lists instead. We tried to bring it more to the forefront by integrating it with Slack, but instead, the constant notifications just drove everyone crazy. After some additional testing and research, we made the switch to Notion, where not only are we able to track tasks, but we can design our testing framework, track results and budgets, and consolidate meeting notes. This is still very much a work in progress. We still have a lot to tackle in 2021, but we have already learned that optimizing operations, workflows, and processes is a never-ending job, especially in a professional services business. ‍"," Step one of growth marketing is always to start with a great product that delights users, so we worked hard to drive outstanding results for our early partners and let the work speak for itself, leading to many referrals. These early clients were pivotal, both by proving our squad model works and for nominating us to TechCrunch, where we were selected as a Verified Expert Growth Marketing Agency, one of our first major PR victories. So our primary acquisition tactic has really been focusing on driving exceptional quality of service to our existing clients. This often gets us more business within the brand and beyond when talents move between brands.  At the end of the day, we make a better margin in the long term, so fewer clients, higher quality is the way our model works best.  Content marketing via our NoGood blog has been a great lever as well. Leveraging our growth marketing expertise in Content, Social, and SEO, our organic traffic is up over 630% year over year and has served as a reliable secondary source of lead generation. As far as sales, a significant differentiator for NoGood is that we donʼt have a classic sales bench. From our first conversation, our clients work directly with our growth marketers, where we learn what success means to each business and how we can translate that success into measurable metrics.

162,nox," Hi I’m Jeremiah, a self-taught digital marketer, UI/UX designer, and ex-entrepreneur based in Singapore. I’m currently working as a UI/UX designer at AdZiggy, where we aim to bring programmatic marketing to small businesses. I started NOX back in 2015 with 2 of my cousins and 2 good friends. The initial idea was a nightlife app that allowed users to browse events, book bottle services, sign up for VIP guest lists, etc. At that time, we raised around S$120,000 (Singapore Dollars) in seed funding from several angel investors and were hustling to build our dream. I was in charge of deploying marketing campaigns from ideation to execution. Mistakes were made and lessons were learned. After about a year, we decided to pivot the business in an attempt to save it — We made use of our connections in the alcohol industry and turned NOX into an e-commerce platform (NOX Express) focusing on alcoholic beverages. We even managed to turn the company around and at its peak made over S$250,000 in yearly revenue. "," There were several reasons why NOX failed. Although at our peak, we made around S$250,000 in annual revenue. Yet, due to critical mistakes and increasing competition from bigger players, everything slowly started to go downhill from there. One of the main causes would be a lack of financial discipline. I think that it’s very important for startups to learn to manage and control their burn rate. You shouldn’t be starving, but by spending strategically, you allow yourself more runway and freedom. We also realized that it would be hard for us to continue when we had to constantly lower our margin in order to compete with the other bigger players like Redmart, HonestBee, and many more. For me, the speed of growth and scale of operation that I felt inspired by had started feeling out of reach. New competitors were popping up and it was getting harder to maintain our competitive advantage. Even with access to funding, we didn’t have a solid plan to scale the company. Ultimately, the deciding factor was my own lack of confidence to bring the company to the next level. "," When working with my cousins and friends, I realized that it was hard to administer a frank and withering appraisal on their work performance, mainly because I didn’t want to risk hurting our relationship. That decision might have led to unaddressed faults and caused operational issues to continue longer than they should have. Don’t get me wrong, working with friends and family can be a very enjoyable experience, but it definitely doesn’t come without challenges and there’s always the risk of spoiling your relationship. If I could go back in time, I would be more professional in dealing with my “co-founders” and not see them as friends or family while we’re working together. ",,,," None of the founders knew how to build a mobile app or had any prior knowledge of programming or coding. The founding team mainly came from marketing, design & finance backgrounds, hence mobile apps were definitely not within our domain of expertise. We had to hire programmers to help us with creating our app, but it’s super challenging to hire technical roles if you don’t have the expertise to assess candidates. In the end, we did manage to roll out an MVP, which consisted of a simple booking system and a listing of all the major clubs in Singapore. But due to our inexperience and the lack of capable developers, we were unable to take our product to the next step, and ultimately had to pivot our business in order to survive. We then created NOX Express, an alcohol e-commerce website, using Shopify. With the connections we built through NOX, we aimed to educate consumers on the different varieties of alcohol available at affordable costs. We worked with suppliers, importers and brand owners to market their products to our users. ",," It all started when my cousins and I were queuing up to enter a club. There was some popular DJ playing on that particular day, and the club was packed and the queue was insane. We began talking about how we could book tickets to movie theaters, yet still had to queue to enter a club. What began as a small discussion eventually led to the birth of NOX.  The main idea of NOX was simple, we wanted to create a nightlife app where users are able to buy entrance tickets to clubs and pre-order drinks (if they wished so). This would help users to plan their night better, instead of spending their time waiting in line to enter a club. "," I would go straight to creating NOX Express instead of developing a mobile app. The lack of technical expertise was definitely the main pitfall for NOX, which I had to learn the hard way.  I know a lot of people are going to say stuff like good founders can always hire their way out of a technical skill gap. But in reality, this theory falls short as it’s super challenging to hire technical roles if you don’t have the expertise to assess candidates. "," When we first started, we leveraged our connections with the clubs and marketed to their existing customers. We also relied heavily on social media and email marketing in order to grow our user base.  We had good results, especially when we did social media contests, where we would reward the winner with a bottle of alcohol. This allowed us to grow our reach and build a good following. We used content and regular newsletters to engage our users and educate them on new alcohol brands.  We used Klaviyo for our email management, Shopify to create promo codes, and Google Analytics to track and evaluate our marketing campaigns. "," If you want to talk about startups in Singapore, or just want to chat, you can connect with me via LinkedIn. Feel free to reach out to me if you think I could be of help.  I also write about UI/UX design, startups, and technology on Medium here. "," I normally read articles from Medium to learn about other people’s experiences. I also listen to different podcasts like “Tech News Briefings” by WSJ and “Ted Tech” to learn more about the latest news in the technology and startup world.  For videos, I like to watch Scott Galloway (L2inc) as he always has an interesting take on the latest trends in Technology.  "," We lost the most money while trying to create NOX. We raised around S$120,000 and lost all of it (mainly on the salary of our developers). But we managed to be profitable when we pivoted to NOX Express, having annual revenue of S$250,000. ‍",e-Commerce,Mismanagement of Funds,Singapore,"June 13, 2019",Jeremiah Lam,https://www.failory.com/interview/nox,"['https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremiah-lam-2a716a6b/', 'https://medium.com/@nataniellam']",failure,0,,"Jeremiah is an ex-entrepreneur who co-founded NOX, a nightlife app that allowed users to book events, services, and VIPs.

163,okami-pack," I’m currently 32 and live in Atlanta, Georgia. I run an advertising agency and my background is in growth marketing.  That said, by “background,” I mean in the last 5 years. To get here required one of the most painful failures of my professional life. The failure was my “never launched a Kickstarter campaign.”  Before 2014, my career was in event promotion, teaching English, and corporate sales. When my 27th birthday hit, and my 30’s began quickly approaching, the lack of success and fulfillment in my career created an overwhelming sense of desperation. This was when I spent 10 months of my life on a Kickstarter project that would never launch.  While I’ll get to the details later, the pitch was this — an ultra-compact 72-hour disaster survival kit. The vision being “if Apple were to build a survival kit.” Something you could leave in your work cabinet, put in your backpack, or under your car seat. ‍"," When pushed on the question of “capital reservoirs,” the product development company clarified the question: “how much capital do you have to invest in the prototype manufacturing? How much remaining capital do you have to sustain your living expenses?” Embarrassingly, by the end of June 2015, the answer was literally almost zero for both.  In August 2014, once I had made the decision to pursue Okami Pack, I quit my job.  While I had savings, I had little idea of how fast those savings would disappear. By January 2015, I moved back to the United States, I picked up part-time work in the interim, but it was only enough to meet basic living expenses to allow me to focus on the project.  If I was going to have any chance of success, I would need more money. The only route was to pitch to investors — which raised up a second point that allowed me to accept it’s demise: a lack of passion. This wasn’t just a Kickstarter, it was kickstarting a business. Did I care THAT much about the industry to create a pitch deck and ask investors for money? Did I want to run a survival startup at the expense of everything else in my life? No, I did not. I didn’t IDENTIFY with the project on a fundamental level.  At that point, the only thing holding me to that commitment was that I had written in my journal that I would launch it “no matter what” — in ignorance of future information. I was holding onto my own words too stubbornly. The only “passion” I had left for it was avoiding the feeling of humiliation and a loss of integrity from breaking my promise.  After I left the product development company, I spent a few hours mulling over the email I would send to the entire team explaining why the project needed to end.  There was no easy way to spell it out.  It hurt to not just let myself down and the 5 other talented members of the Okami Pack team — but our entire support network we had accumulated over the previous 10 months. Surprisingly, most of the team was accepting and compassionate. I let the product designer keep the prototype. I paid the film crew a small stipend with the very last bit of cash I had. I closed all existing accounts, shut down the website, and closed the never-launched Kickstarter page. The project was officially over.  After a few weeks of an [expected] existential crisis, I knew one thing clearly — I was broke and desperately needed money!  That’s when a silver lining began to appear.  Through my previous networking, I had been introduced to another Kickstarter hopeful who had learned of my project’s demise. He didn’t know much about online marketing and wanted my help. I was extremely reluctant to join someone else’s project, but he had a crucial element I’d been missing all along: funding. He offered me a small salary and his project had a lot of potentials.‍ That Kickstarter went on to earn $120,000 dollars. ‍"," Outside of the lack of capital, the timeline had a lot of challenges: Lack of product development expertise until very late in the project — didn’t get a product designer until 6 months in.Non-optimal co-founder — I was single and able to make it my top priority. My partner had a full-time job, had two kids and a wife, and was in Tokyo still after I moved back to the USA.Lack of experience in the survival/prepping industry — for both myself and my co-founder. This caused us to be over-reliant on third parties for reviewing, which slowed down the project considerably.Working on too much at once - in addition to building Okami Pack, I was still trying to make my online blog successful and throw music events with the hope it would pay my life expenses (it didn’t.)Not networking with successful Kickstarter founders  — I didn’t do this until far too late in the process. I realized it took some of them YEARS to launch. Personal issues — I had an impactful death in the family. My Mom passed away suddenly halfway through the project in January 2015. Instead of grieving, I put much of this focus back into the project when I should have likely paused the project and re-evaluated my life.  Many of the avoidable challenges & mistakes really came down to a lack of product development experience and not accurately assessing living and capital expenses over a long time horizon (9 months).‍ Additionally, the “profit share” payout for the team had some major flaws and wasn’t well thought out. Had I launched the project, this likely would have led to some serious cash flow problems as we were starting a business and did not have a financial road map that took accurately took their profit shares into account.",,,," In August 2014, I pitched the idea to my colleague at the Japanese company I was at who had experience with sourcing products from China - he loved the idea and agreed to be my co-founder. His wife was Japanese and this also allowed him to research the best Japanese survival gear/equipment.   We called it Okami Pack because okami means “wolf” in Japanese. We wanted to make the most effective “wolf pack.” We even spent a few nights walking around Akihabara trying to find the best survival tech gadgets. Most of the initial few months were spent on product market research so we could finalize the initial product concept. We studied all the survival equipment in Japan, all the Kickstarters of innovative survival kits, and many of the available bug out bags on the market in the United States.  Online, I realized there were entire communities of “doomsday preppers” - so I read many of the forums and subreddits to understand the different types of survival gear. Eventually, I recruited a team around the Kickstarter — all based on the promise of future payment should the Kickstarter earn money (a % of profit structure). At this point, I was fully confident it would succeed. Our team was: co-foundervideo production team for the Kickstarter videographic designerweb developerproduct designer & developer Our initial version wasn’t so pretty, but it was functional: The inside of the pack was separated based on three needs —sustainment (to address nutrition, drinkable water/purification), first aid + hygiene, and tools (lighting, chargers, fasteners, protection). We tried many iterations but struggled with form vs function. The more items the pack contained, the longer the pack could sustain survival situations, but the heavier, less portable, and thicker it was. We also understood the importance of aesthetics given it’s target demographic (affluent urban millennials).  By May 2015, we finally had the pack finalized and our first official prototype. After completion of the initial prototype, I got help from SCORE, which offered free small business mentorship and was immensely helpful. They took my prototype seriously and made introductions for me. In May, I had Prepared Associates (an emergency services company) review the pack. I also had a Director at the Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Services review the pack as well. By June 2015 — 9 months after starting, I was running painfully low on funds (less than $1,000 dollars). I met with a product development company for breakfast — ones who had done their own Kickstarter successfully — to recharge my motivation. They informed me of the likely costs of manufacturing our prototype and explained that the most painful part was actually after launching — fulfillment. They asked about my remaining capital reservoirs.  This was when a harsh reality began to set in.",," At the time, I was living in Tokyo, Japan. I had pivoted out of a career in English teaching into corporate sales. During an earthquake one day, I reached under my office desk and found a survival bag that was entirely outdated with very poorly made products. Not only was this inconvenient, but it surprised me!  This is Tokyo - a tech capital and in one of the most earthquake-prone countries on the planet. Additionally, given how long most people commute in Tokyo, I thought — “this is all they got to make it home?” I also realized that I didn’t even own a survival kit in my own home! Upon inquiry with friends and colleagues, many people had no “bug out bag” (72-hour prep kit) for a major catastrophic disaster either. In addition to my demanding corporate job at the time, I had also picked up some marketing skills on the side by promoting nightlife events and blogging about it. I knew a few things about startups, and one of my favorite websites was Kickstarter. I was living paycheck to paycheck, and with all the work (corporate, events, and blog), I was hardly sleeping. My life felt like an endless grind. I needed a way out ...and that was Okami Pack. ‍"," Quite simply — I would have joined a pre-existing Kickstarter (as I did AFTER the project failure) rather than trying to do it all from the beginning. That’s in hindsight though!  Assuming I had chosen to follow a similar path and do this from scratch… I would have had a survival enthusiast as one of the co-founders in the same time zone as me and available to work equal hours.I would have found a product developer much earlier in the process (perhaps a third co-founder).I would have moved my role away from the CEO of everything (product, sourcing from China, design, marketing,etc.) to just marketing and hiring the team.  I would have had an ‘evaluation’ every 3 months (like I do now, for all projects) to assess progress (or lack thereof).I would have asked for critical feedback FROM THE BEGINNING. My co-founder and I naively were paranoid that someone would steal our idea.I would have not pursued other ideas for income (music events, blog, etc.) while doing this — this would have greatly accelerated the process instead of dragging it out to eventual failure.

I could have been earning $50K per year (roughly the minimum fair market rate at the time for sales and digital marketing skills). Instead, I did part-time Uber driving and freelance SEO work — only enough to meet my monthly expenses. I was so blindly focused on this project that I had lost sight of how much I was giving up. From September 2014 — July 2015, I had invested (and lost) the following: Direct Capital Investment: $3,000Living Expenses: $15,000 (I had free rent from living with family)Opportunity Cost of Salary: $41,660 ($50,000*10 months) Total Cost: $59,660 I reiterate this to everyone thinking of “quitting their job” or even pursuing their project “on the side.” Pursuing your project has opportunity cost (thank you Economics degree) — these costs aren’t just what you put into inventory and development (direct capital), but the money you DON’T earn with your time.  ‍",e-Commerce,Lack of Funds,United States,"December 5, 2019",Tim Chard,https://www.failory.com/interview/okami-pack,"['https://www.timchard.com/', 'https://www.ascenial.com/', 'https://www.theagentsofchange.com/kickstarter-launch-guide/', 'https://adespresso.com/blog/facebook-ads-for-kickstarter-guide/']",failure,0,,"Tim is a 32-years-old entrepreneur who in 2014 spent 10 months working on a Kickstarter project that would never launch: the Okami Pack.

164,ombori,"  Hello, my name is Andreas Hassellof, and I am the founder and CEO of OmboriGrid AB (publ), based in Stockholm.   Ombori is all about providing “digital experiences in physical spaces.” In other words, we create interactive installations and apps that change the way people behave when they’re in stores, airports, or other places - we’re creating smart stores, smart offices, and so on.  By leveraging intuitive technologies, Ombori creates retail and industry solutions that help businesses and organizations streamline their operations, provide unparalleled customer experiences, and maximize their results. Through our recent Marketplace launch, we have released our code-free Ombori solutions to help businesses and organizations with things like occupancy control, queue management, and BOPIS (buy online, pick up in-store). ",," COVID was our biggest challenge. In 2020, retailers weren’t interested in putting fancy installations in their stores. They were far more concerned about how to stay in business.  However, the other huge challenge - and where I made a lot of mistakes - was finding the right team. Like many tech entrepreneurs, I know what makes a good developer, and I like to think I’m pretty good at hiring developers. Hiring sales and marketing people, however, that’s a whole different story.   I’ve spent years with these products, and I know them intimately. I understand the customers and their needs, and I’ve gotten pretty good at selling to them. However, finding people who are the right cultural fit for Ombori and training them to sell our products has been a big problem for me. There’s so much knowledge locked up in my head, and a lot of it is almost instinctive now, and not easy to explain. Tied in with that is something that almost every entrepreneur will relate to - it’s really easy to get burned out because you’re trying to manage everything. Writing the code, doing the selling, directing the marketing, meeting partners, raising funds, paying the bills - you have to take care of it all and it’s really hard to let it go. Then, you become a bottleneck, because everyone else is waiting on you, and you just can’t keep up.  It’s not an ego thing, where you want to keep control of everything. It’s more a sense of fear - you feel like you have to do everything because you’re the only person who knows what’s going on. At the same time, you’re so busy that you don’t even have time to delegate a job and brief someone else so that they can take it off you. At some point, you have to make the time, empower someone else to do the job, and let them get on with it - even if you could have done it better. ‍",," Right now, we’re focused on building the Marketplace of apps. We’re not going to be able to build everything, so we’re creating a developer program where other people can create their Ombori Grid apps and sell them through us. That’s going to completely transform the way we operate and how we see ourselves. We’re no longer just developers, but we’re a go-to hub for clients to find whatever they need to go through the never-ending process of digital transformation. What Apple is to iPhone users, that’s what we want to be for businesses. ‍",," The Ombori Grid took a long time to come to fruition. In 2015, I realized that building m-commerce apps was far too slow and expensive. The speed and cost of development just couldn’t keep pace with the rate of change of the industry.  What retailers needed was a simple, fast way to get hold of a mobile commerce app that would integrate with their website and back-end infrastructure. So, we came up with the idea of Web2App, a tool that would automatically create a mobile commerce app based on the customer’s existing e-commerce site, literally within minutes, with no coding required.  Then, we realized that what they also needed was a marketplace, like an app store, where they could just go and find the product they needed, customize it, and deploy it without even talking to a salesperson. We called it PresenceKit, and you’ve probably never heard of it. In the meantime, we were building all sorts of interesting pilot projects with companies like House of Dagmar, Lindt, Telenor, and Clas Ohlson, and then, in collaboration with Microsoft, we built a talking, voice-controlled interactive “selfie mirror”, which was installed in H&M’s flagship store in Manhattan.  That led us to talk with major brands around the world who told us that they wanted fun digital things to put in their stores and transform the shopping experience. And then…COVID. The worldwide lockdowns meant that every single project we had was put on hold, pretty much within a few days. We had to come up with something fast, or go out of business. We’d already been talking to Kjell, a Swedish retail chain, about IoT systems to count the number of people in stores, so we fast-tracked that and started deploying it to customers worldwide.  Because we’d built everything starting from a mindset of rapid and easy deployment and compatibility with existing hardware and software, what we ended up creating was effectively PresenceKit for IoT. The Ombori Grid is a unifying platform on which all of our solutions are built, and then there’s a marketplace of ready-to-use, customizable Azure IoT apps that can be deployed and scaled rapidly.  So, as well as occupancy control, we have appointment booking systems, video customer service systems, order pickup systems, digital signage, self-checkout systems, interactive wayfinders, and more. A client can come to the Marketplace and find all sorts of ways to transform their premises and the way they work, run a pilot, and then scale up when they’re ready.  It’s not just for retailers - our solutions also work for offices, healthcare, restaurants, and all sorts of other businesses. ",,"  In my teenage years, I was an Evangelist. That may sound like an odd place to start, but much of who I am grew from that. I spent my days pitching ideas, often to people who weren’t interested, and I learned a lot about resilience in the process.   I left that world and became a tech entrepreneur. I started a lot of different companies, some of which were more successful than others. Then, I started Ombori. It was originally a consultancy company, and that facet of the company is still in existence. The profits from that consultancy piece of the business have enabled me to fund my other ventures, which all operate under the banner of Ombori Group.    Ombori Apps - which will shortly be rebranded as Ombori Grid, the name of our flagship product - is one of those. We started off trying to build a social shopping platform, then we moved into mobile apps, and now it’s evolved into this whole new thing."," Oh wow, So many lessons I want to share here! ‍Be open to opportunities and be ready to get out of your comfort zone. I would never have guessed that our first successes would come from the fashion industry, but that’s how it happened. I remember waking up one day, and realizing that Vogue and Elle were writing about me. That was weird. ‍Timing is everything. So many of the things we did in the early days were fantastic, innovative, wonderful ideas, but the market just wasn’t ready for them and we had to abandon them, but, strangely, things went full circle. Some of the code we wrote for Helishopter, our social shopping app, is in use in Ombori Grid. As I explained above, the Ombori Grid Marketplace is just PresenceKit in a new - and much improved - form. ‍Focus on recurring revenue. Making sales and closing deals is hard, especially for a start-up. If your business model is based on one-off deals, you’re forever chasing the money to pay next month’s bills. Recurring revenue gives you a certain amount of stability. It’s also easier to close deals because there’s so much less sticker shock for the client. Lastly, surround yourself with good people. Not just in your team, but pick the right partners. That’s everyone from outsourcers to PR companies to advisors and lawyers. After all, they’re going to be doing most of the work, not you. If they’re not the right fit, don’t be shy to let them go and find someone else."," I can’t stress enough how important our partners have been. Working with Microsoft has been incredible. When Satya Nadella showcased our H&M selfie mirror at Envision in 2018, the interest in Ombori suddenly went through the roof. We’ve also worked with Samsung, Avanade, and TechData, and, most importantly, ITAB, which invested in Ombori Grid a couple of years ago.  Having partners like these means that we can get access to C-level decision-makers at major brands like Warner, Target, or IKEA, and we go into meetings with immense credibility. Of course, it’s like adding a bunch of salespeople to the team. In addition, we‘ve done a lot of content marketing, blogging, guest posts, and so on. Perhaps the ones I enjoy most have been our live-streamed events. We’ve had thousands of people tuning in to watch them, and we’ve had immense support from clients and partners.  To celebrate and highlight the impact of the Ombori Grid Marketplace apps, we recently held a live-streamed event, which can be viewed here:  "," To learn more about Ombori, please visit our website and find our Ombori Grid Marketplace solutions here. To learn more about my journey as an entrepreneur, please visit my Medium page.  Ombori has been featured in a myriad of recent press, including this one."," Here’s my pro-tip. If you’re dealing with startups and small companies, use Google tools (Docs, Sheets, etc) and Zoom. If you’re dealing with enterprise customers, use Microsoft Office and Teams. It may sound silly, but it makes a huge difference when it comes to sharing documents and collaboration.  ",,Software & Hardware,,Sweden,"August 17, 2021",Andreas Hassellof,https://www.failory.com/interview/ombori,"['https://ombori.com', 'https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/ombori.omboriapps?tab=overview', 'https://hassellof.medium.com/', 'https://www.androidguys.com/promoted-news/omboris-customer-experience-focus-drives-smart-store-innovation/', 'https://www.techtimes.com/articles/260130/20210511/ombori-reveals-benefits-of-airport-virtual-assistants.htm']",success,1,No Data,"Andreas founded Ombori, which provides “digital experiences in physical spaces"" and aims to change the way people behave in stores.

165,onak," Hey Failories. We are an Engineer (Thomas), experienced outdoor sales manager (Dominique) and Designer (Otto) and we’re currently working to make the best collapsible canoe out there. ONAK is a full-fledged, extremely durable and high-performance canoe of 4m65 that can be folded from a compact trolley in 15 minutes. In compact form it measures 120 x 40 x 25 cm and weighs 17 kg, so it fits perfectly in your car, in an airplane, on the train, on the bus or behind your bicycle. In the company Dominique is responsible for sales and operations, Otto for design and Thomas is CEO and CTO. We’re mainly selling the canoes direct to consumer through our website, but we do sell through retailers and have anambassador program as well. ‍",," As indicated before, the biggest challenge, in my opinion, was to fund the thing. There have always been technological challenges, but we’re pretty good at solving these. Hardware is expensive though, and your product needs to be finished before you can start selling. So, the first challenge, in my opinion, was to fund the prototype development and marketing cost needed to launch our crowdfunding campaign. The second challenge was actually delivering in time, and here, you don’t have everything in hand. It’s hard to get from prototype to full-fledged product in a few months and to get everything produced in time. Especially when you’re the only one able to process your material. We were literally forced to start our own factory, with a special custom-made machine to produce the canoes. Doing that in 9 months proved pretty challenging, especially because one of our manufacturers was 4 months late and another one could not deliver on time at all and had to be replaced. The last major challenge for ONAK itself is overcoming the fact that the product is very seasonal. Demand is high during summer, low in winter. This has its advantages and disadvantages, but the biggest problem for us here is that it means that you need a lot of time to see a growth pattern and the amount of stock needed is hard to predict the first years. That combined with the fact that many pieces need to be ordered months upfront and in big batches, the effect of this is not to be underestimated. Order too little material and you lose sales, order too much and you risk running out of money while having 100 thousands of euros laying in stock. This is one of the reasons why we try to work as much as possible with local manufacturers that can deliver quickly and in smaller amounts. We’re also working on less seasonal applications of our material. In personal life, the financial burden of starting a startup, especially in the beginning, combined with the work pressure, can be quite hard. It is important to keep a good balance here and to know what you’re getting yourself into.  I think this was assuming that sales would automatically go as fast as during the crowdfunding once we could deliver for real and that we would not need retailers during the start. A lot of marketing is needed though, and people need to time and a place to touch / try the product before acquiring a high-priced leisure product like ours. So, we quickly reconsidered this and are actively working with retailers and distributors now. We honestly also underestimated the difficulty of making the buildup process fool-proof. We’ve gotten a ton better than a year ago, but we’re still working on this and this is so important, especially when you start working with resellers. Another mistake was putting too much trust in the wrong manufacturers. If you depend on one or more, check their track record and make sure they know what they’re doing and will be able to deliver in time. We had one manufacturer that offered to do a lot for us, which sounded awesomely simple, but wasn’t. This manufacturer was no specialist in many parts of what they offered to do, leading to a delay of 4 months! Choosing specialized manufacturers would have been a lot faster and cheaper. ‍",,," The biggest disadvantage of the founding team is clearly that none of us had any experience actually launching a new product or manufacturing it yourself. The biggest disadvantages of the market are the facts that it is so seasonal, pretty conservative and slow in adopting changes. Also, Belgium is traditionally one of the worse places in the western world to sell canoes - so our home base is not ideal considering the market. The main disadvantage of the ONAK canoe in comparison with your competitors is the entry curve. A lot of unusual concepts are used to make it possible, and these need to be learned. This means the first setup can be a little challenging and takes a while, especially for people who don’t like to read manuals. ‍"," The process of making an idea that only exists in a creative’s mind into reality can be tricky. In our case, it took 4 years to deliver the first canoes to our clients. Everything started with paper models, the first made in 2013. Soon after, we started developing the first prototypes by hand using material we got for free from manufacturers that believed in us. This allowed us to get far enough to apply for government funding (subsidy) allowing us to make a few prototypes of high enough quality to kickstart our crowdfunding campaign in July 2016. These were produced by industrial tools: we used custom extruded gunnels, made the material using our manufacturer’s laminator and applied the folding lines using a CNC-machine with some custom modifications we made especially for the task. The initial prototype looked quite a bit smaller than the current canoe and was very unstable. A lot of the principles are still preserved through. We never had any doubts about the technical feasibility. And we were never proven wrong. As every startup though, we did have financial doubts. We put in all our savings, but this was far from what we needed to develop this. Product development took longer than expected and finding our initial investors took time too. There certainly have been a few times where we didn’t see how we could continue funding the company, but somehow, we always managed. We did love the process though. Building and doing completely new things is what makes startups great and drives us! Considering the pricing of the product, you define a lower limit based on your estimated production costs & an upper cost based on the market. We launched the product on Kickstarter, and that went better than expected. We raised more than € 235 000, 157% of our goal.",," Otto and I are longtime urban paddlers. We’ve been canoeing in the waters of Ghent, Belgium for more than 10 years, every week, after work. Storing a canoe in the city proved quite a challenge though, and after years, you tend to have seen all there is to see in a city. Even in Ghent. We wanted to explore further. So, our first intention was to buy a collapsible canoe already on the market. But in 2013, the options were really limited. We could only choose between inflatables, which have very bad performance on flat water, or skin-over frame canoes, which are expensive and take way too much time to assemble. We wanted to canoe after work, so we couldn’t waste time assembling. Hence the idea to make our own canoe. Otto made the first drafts and paper models, allowing us to start an innovation project that was eventually funded by the state. With Thomas’ technical knowledge, those drafts could also be transformed into reality and thanks to Dominique, we are able to grow sales so we can continue improving the canoe and even start applying our origami technology to other products & industries. Considering our backgrounds: both Otto and Dominique used to work in AS Adventure, the biggest outdoor store chain in Belgium. Otto as a salesman, Dominique as sales & outdoor manager. Both know the market very well and given Otto’s passion for product design and studies as a graphic designer, he did a very good job drafting & improving the canoe. Dominique, on the other hand, knows even more about sales and has managerial experience, which proved to be very handy. Thomas is our technical guy. He studied Engineering Physics, worked as a Software engineer in a CAM business and successfully ran a web development company. He played an important role in bringing the canoe into reality, including the development of our patented origami material and technologies, and manages everything that has to do with Production, technology, IT and Legal within the business. ‍", I would mainly tell myself to use the classical sales model with retailers instead of trying to go all in on direct to consumer. Other than that I would share all the specific market knowledge we’ve acquired now of course. There are not many other things I would change though. ‍," We launched with a Kickstarter campaign during the summer of 2016. Timing is always a guess for the launching of a new product, but the season peaks in July. We had a lot of media attention thanks to the Bizidee prize we won in May and our promotional trip through Europe, which we could leverage to launch the product internationally. With this initial boost, a lot of work and the help of the marketing agencies Hyperstarter and FINN, we were able to reach 25% of our goal within one day. Online social and press media were our main sales channels for the Kickstarter campaign, and given the visual character of our product, video worked especially well. In the end, we went absolutely viral with it and were featured in Business Insider Design where we reached more than a million views in one day. We even appeared in Time Magazine as well. All of this was combined with being visible in real life. We were present at the Outdoor show during the middle of the campaign and won the Outdoor Award for the best startup there. This gave us extra attention and made it possible for people to see and feel our product. Like with every Kickstarter the first few hours and days are very important. We quickly reached the magically 30% of our goal thanks to our campaign before the launch. Between 30% and 70%, backing slowed a little bit down. So, we worked very hard to get featured as much as possible. And then after the 70%, it was like a rocket. Orders came in so fast we even couldn’t follow. What really worked for us was being 24/24 and 7/7 being involved with communication, answering questions, adapting the FAQ. ‍"," You can find everything about ONAK on our website. We also welcome you to follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube to stay up to date."," The startup podcast from Gimlet was a big inspiration for us.

166,one-hour-professor," For those that don't know me, my name is Ron and I can be found over at OneHourProfessor. In terms of my background, prior to getting involved in this online business stuff, I spent about eight years in corporate America. Things were going well there, I had a six-figure job and a pretty good gig as a digital marketing manager, but I always felt a calling to be more entrepreneurial and the OneHourProfessor website was my first real introduction to this lifestyle. Originally, I intended on making the One Hour Professor website into a hub of online courses that I could then sell to my audience. At first, I was blogging on this website two to three times per week in an effort to gain an audience and I would say that I was mildly successful, but the courses never seemed to sell no matter what I tried. The original idea of the website, and why it got its name, was that I was going to make one-hour long courses that will cover a very specific concept related to digital marketing and help my audience. That isn’t at all how things turned out though. Although I still have the One Hour Professor website, that's just my home base to tell people about the number of different projects I have and what I learn as I go. At this point, my core business is that I run a portfolio of successful websites which I’ve created from scratch that generates hundreds of thousands of page views every single month. Here’s an image of my most successful website’s analytics from January: My portfolio consists of six different websites that all vary in their level of success. About 80% of my income comes from one website, but I'm working to diversify this even further with my other websites so that my income comes from more revenue streams.  As of now, I make right around $10,000 of revenue each month and of that, the profit is right around $8,500. Most of the expenses that I have are centered around writers and editors of my content, which allows me to focus on bigger picture things. At this point, I have a team of five people working for me and although they are just part-time contractors, without them my businesses wouldn't succeed. Here’s a quick snapshot of my Adsense earnings in January as that is the bulk of my earnings each month.  I think it’s important to note that my journey wasn’t easy and there were so many trials and difficulties since I’ve started. Because of this, one of the things that I've been very good about since the beginning was to make sure that I always publish a monthly income report.  It's been really cool to look back in the history of everything to see how far I've come. Here’s a snapshot of my last six months of income reports: I think that my main motivation for becoming an entrepreneur wasn't so much financial as it was controlling my own schedule.  Something about having to deal with traffic every day, sit in a cubicle, and answer to a boss just never sat well with me and although it took me awhile to make the transition, it ate me away on the inside every single day.  ",," I think that failure is something that every online entrepreneur talks about, and for me, this was the biggest obstacle that I faced. I can't tell you how many different projects I tried and failed at.  I recall at one point creating videos on YouTube in an effort to get affiliate commissions through that channel, that didn't work. I recall creating at least a dozen websites in various niches and they failed miserably because I had no idea what I was doing. In fact, even with One Hour Professor I technically failed right from the start because the business model I originally chose didn't work. For me, the failure itself is only failure if I don’t learn anything. I would say that many of these failures were a blessing because they taught me a lot of great things on what I need to do and, more importantly, what I shouldn't do. In terms of the other biggest challenges that I’ve faced, I was definitely blessed in that I had some Internet marketing knowledge prior to embarking on this journey, but web design is not a point of strength for me. I'm still not a web designer, but I was able to find tools that helped me in creating (good enough) looking websites. Personally, I use Thrive Themes to create my websites and that's been an absolute godsend in helping me be successful.  My final challenge, and I would say that this is still a challenge, is trying to have a work/life balance. My wife yells at me nearly every single day because I'm typically working too late into the night and I’ve found that this is because I'm so passionate about what I do that I don't even consider it work. That said, it's still something that I work on every single day and something that I struggle with because I truly enjoy what I do, but I obviously need to make room for my family in addition to work.    It's hard to answer this question because I'm not really focused only on the One Hour Professor website. That said, I do remember that I originally created the One Hour Professor website I focused far too much of my time on keyword research and basically, I was creating content that would get me some traffic but had absolutely no value for my business. For instance, I remember at one point I spent many hours creating a blog post about various social media facts. While this might have been an interesting topic, it didn't bring anybody into my website that I really wanted and it provided no business value whatsoever.  Beyond the One Hour Professor website, I'd say that the worst mistake I've committed to date is working on too many things at once. Like most entrepreneurs, I have the shiny object syndrome tend to have way too many ideas come to me at one time. Because of this, there have been numerous times when I started three or four different projects and only follow through on one of them. In order to really succeed with a website, you have to focus on first making it great.  Then, once you have that done, you can create procedures and hire great writers that consistently pump out quality content.  Once that’s done, you can hire an editor to manage everything and move to the next project. Nowadays, I'll never work on more than two projects at once. For me, this tends to work pretty well and I think that doing too many things at once is a very common mistake that most people need to avoid if they want to succeed. My personal advice is to only work on one project at a time and put everything you have into it and be determined to succeed. If it does succeed, and you can create processes and build a team to manage it, then you can begin to work on other projects. This is the exact path that I've taken (after many failures) and it's worked out pretty well so far.",,," I would say that my greatest disadvantage from the start was always lack of money. Or, put in a better way, the amount of money that I couldn’t invest in my businesses.  Even now, I still have bills to pay every month, but if I had an extra $10,000-$20,000 to invest in my website and still live comfortably it would propel my growth significantly. In addition to that, another great disadvantage that I have is I can't seem to create a funnel that really works with Facebook traffic. I can't tell you how many times I've tested this and how many hours and dollars I've wasted trying to make this happen, and I know some people can do it, but I'm not one of them. As much as I would love to create a course and sell thousands of copies, I've pretty much given up on that dream and instead focus on creating websites in specific niches which tends to be the area that I'm good at.  For your pleasure, a quick snapshot of my old Homepage.  Needless to say, I’ve come a long way. ‍"," As mentioned above, the original intention of One Hour Professor was to create courses for my audience and sell those courses.  While I do have one specific course that I give away for free which leads to purchasing another course, this idea never seems to work for me. I found that the Internet marketing space is hypercompetitive and it's just so much easier to make a living in other areas. That said, my business model on One Hour Professor now is more focused on affiliate marketing as opposed to selling courses.  Although I do sell a few courses a month, I’ve found that affiliate marketing is a much easier way to make money for this particular website.  Most of my affiliate marketing is centered around creating reviews and tutorials for various software programs or products that I use myself and earning a commission from them. ‍",,," If I could choose one thing that I'd like to do differently, it would definitely be to better understand and grow my social media presence on all of my websites. I've never been much of a social media guy and while I do have personal accounts on various social media channels, it's never something that I really enjoyed.  That said, I do feel like there is a place in Internet marketing for this particular channel from a traffic standpoint and I wish that I was better at understanding how to grow my pages and reach my audience through organic traffic and paid methods. ‍"," Since I've created so many different websites from inception to their current state and have consistently repeated a model where my websites generate income, most of my marketing strategies are focused on three different areas now. First is to find the right niche and focus on keyword research to make sure that the amount of search volume is worth creating a website. This is the most crucial part and when you decide whether creating the website is worth it in the first place.  The second step is creating quality content, and lots of it. At this point, I rarely write content myself and outsource most of it, but there are certain times when I'll write a blog post or a review because I feel like I know how to explain things better than some of my writers. Usually what will happen on a new website I launch is I'll wait till I have about 50 articles on the site itself before I begin any outreach to try to link build. Which brings me to my third and final step, link building. This is definitely where I spend the majority of my time nowadays and although it's an acquired skill, this is by far the most important skill you can have when marketing a website.  If you want to succeed with SEO, which is all that I really focus on, this is necessary to succeed. Nowadays I spend most my time reviewing what my editor publishes on my websites and link building. I have a very systematic approach to everything that I do so I found a way to streamline the process so that I mostly just answer emails, and as I do that my content continues to be created by my team. In the beginning, it wasn't this way, but now that I've got some decent revenue each month I can reinvest in growing the websites by hiring people to help.  Here’s a snapshot of my most successful site showing SEO traffic growth since I created it:"," I think the best place to reach me is definitely the OneHourProfessor website. This is my “home base” and it's where I'm able to connect with so many different people on their journey into this online business stuff.  I also have my entire portfolio of websites, like TranscriptionJobsHQ that I run, but I typically don't share these to try to deter copycats.  It's unfortunate that I had to do this, but in the past I did a podcast and within a month found three new sites in the exact same niche trying to copy what I did.  If people are really interested in learning more about my story and would like to get a free course to help them get started, they can click right here to read my post about the truth about online business."," The learning process for me was an interesting one. What I did when I started was listen to podcasts for hours on end during my commute from my corporate job. I knew it was time to stop listening and take action when I could come up with the answers to questions before anyone answered.  For instance, a podcast guest would ask a question and in my head I would say what the podcast host would reply before he said a word. When I first started off, Pat Flynn from Smart Passive Income was my main go to. That worked pretty well and got me in the right path, but I found that he typically focuses his content on those who are still beginning and since then I've had to discover other podcasts that are more in line with my current situation.  For me, those podcasts have been the Digital Journey Podcast, Masters of Scale, Freedom Flipping, My Wife Quit Her Job, How I Built This, Niche Pursuits, the Authority Hacker Podcast and lastly the Empire Flippers podcast. For me, podcasts tend to be a much better solution when I'm trying to learn as I can listen to them while I work out, while I'm on a commute, or even while I'm relaxing.  I prefer this over books and typically listening to the podcast at 2x speed.  ",,Education,,United States,"February 21, 2019",Ron Stefanski,https://www.failory.com/interview/one-hour-professor,"['http://www.onehourprofessor.com/', 'http://transcriptionjobshq.com/', 'http://www.onehourprofessor.com/truth-about-online-business/']",success,1,$0-$10k/mo,"Ron runs One Hour Professor, a blog in which he informs his readers how are things going on with his 6 other projects.

167,onepagetrip," I’m a Portuguese-Aussie girl, born and raised in Lisbon who moved to Sydney a few years ago. I’m passionate about Digital and Traveling. For years I had Digital roles for big corporates and I was traveling for leisure, might have visited more than 50 countries. While traveling I realized my best source of information and the easiest way to get local tips was from friends who’ve been there, friends of friends or travel communities. So I and 2 other awesome and hard working guys decided to create Onepagetrip. It failed and I’ll tell you why. The day I closed Onepagetrip I had a new vision :) but the runway was becoming an issue - as you can imagine Sydney is an expensive city. We can’t control the wind but we can adjust the sails, so I came back to Lisbon. I applied to a startup accelerator program called Lisbon Challenge at Beta-i and today I’m glad I did it. Talkifly, my current startup, was born here. Talkifly is disrupting business travel by putting an end to the repetitive and tedious work that Executives and Operations Managers have to go through to manage travel. Our cool technology serves highly efficient teams giving them the tools they need to easily and quickly get things done (things ie. approvals, billing, invoices, travelers profile and preferences, etc you name it) and is backed up by real-time chat travel assistants to whom they can delegate whatever they need and whose focus is to understand travelers needs and give them what’s best. Here’s a 30sec chat demo.  "," I believe that, among other smaller issues, the big problem was that we didn’t know how to make money out of it. We tried these 2 things: 1) hotel affiliate booking - when a hotel was mentioned in the itinerary there was a click off to book that hotel, 2) pay to disclose the full itinerary - we would show part of the itinerary but if you wanted to use it you’d have to pay a small amount. Nothing worked. Not having a good plan to make money from the beginning was such a stupid rookie mistake. We spent months building a product, making it better and better. We didn’t build an MVP as planned. We got so involved in features and details that we forgot the bigger picture.                                                                                                                                                ",,,," I already mentioned a few disadvantages but let me summarise here. The biggest one was the competition, I had a feeling that I could put millions into Google AdWords and I could be the best person in the world optimizing for SEO but I would never rank in the 1st 50 positions. It was so frustrating, for every travel-related word there were so many billion dollar companies competing. It was impossible for us to stand out. It would take us years and we didn’t have the time. ‘Life is tough, my darling, but so are you’ - Stephanie Bennett Henry. I’m very persistent and sometimes that is more emotional than rational - can be a disadvantage too. But the second biggest disadvantage was our lack of expertise about how to build a startup, how to validate an idea, how to ‘pivot’, how to validate the basic Business Model Canvas. And the 3rd one I believe it was our runaway. Sydney is really expensive, we had to keep our day jobs and after one year Lucas, our tech guy, had to go back full time to a day job too. The team broke and there were no conditions to keep going.  ",," Ok, first I need to point out that we wanted to build a marketplace. So we needed people to write itineraries and people to use/download them. First, we started by asking friends and family. We asked them to create itineraries for trips they have done, local gems they had found and things that would be great to share with other travelers. They helped to increase our portfolio of itineraries and we did a lot of social campaigns, build social communities and nothing was really working, people didn’t have a strong motivation to spend their time sharing their trip with others and we didn’t have money to pay them. We launch a contest and that brought us a few new itineraries but was just marginal. So with the itineraries we had, around 50-60, we decided to start bringing users to the site and for that, we launched social campaign and we did a fair bit of Google AdWords. People would come to the site, use the information that was available for them, download a few itineraries and leave without spending a cent.","  Onepagetrip was a travel itinerary sharing community. There, you could find itineraries from different people, pick the ones you related with and using trip planning tools you could mix them up and build your own itinerary. This 1 min video shows how the product used to work. I was really lucky with the team. We were 3 founders, myself, Jose who was working for Expedia and Lucas who was an incredible tech guru with more than 20 years experience and an amazing person to work with, learned a lot from him. We worked together for more than 1 year but we couldn’t make any money out of it. We built a product without testing the idea first, we underestimated our competitors, Jose and I kept our daily jobs which was a huge mistake and we were just rookies in this startup world. For one year the 3 of us were working on building the best product we could and on promoting the product the best we could with a very limited budget.   ","  Easy: quit my daily job, cut down my monthly expenses, apply to a startup accelerator program, get mentors, validate the idea before starting building the product, get advice from reputable mentors in the travel industry and build a strong business model before the 1st line of code.  I learned a lot. Not sure if I have the right words to explain, but I’ll try. I learned how to be efficient, how to leverage tools and methodologies, which I didn’t even know existed, to do my job quicker and better. I learned how cool it is to work with people that are driven and cut the bullshit. I learned how not to give a damn about what people think of me and of what I’m doing, how to do something just because I love to. I learned all the ‘basic’ startup stuff, legal requirement, accountant details, what should an MVP look like, why are people obsessed about Product-Market fit, how important it is to have a strong Business Model and stick to it, etc. Most important I learned how to cool down and control stress.  ‍  My main advice is to avoid staying at home. I mean you can work from home but you need help. Go into a Startup Accelerator Program, learn why others have failed, what have they done wrong (you can use Failory for that), get into the startup community, build your network. Hear what people say but learn how to separate bullshit from good advice. Do your homework, before you build something, make sure people need it, people will use it. Oh! and before I forget, don’t do it if you are not passionate about it.  ",," Note: Talkifly was born in December 2016 and MVP launched & first customers acquired in January 2017.

It details the most difficult part of building a startup - build something that people need/use. Once you have something then you really need to focus on optimizing it. But the worst, the hard bit is to get from zero to one, to find your niche, your product-market fit. ‍  I recommend this podcast called Masters of Scale with Reid Hoffman.

168,oneup," My name is Davis Baer, and I am the co-founder of OneUp, a social media scheduling tool that supports Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Google My Business. OneUp differs from tools like Buffer and Hootsuite because we allow for a post to be set to automatically repeat at set intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, every 3 months, 6 months, or annually. Our customers consist of startup founders, small business owners, bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers, and social media managers - basically any kind of business, or even people who are just building their personal brand. Here are a few examples of how some of our customers use OneUp: We have an e-commerce store owner that has a whole bunch of posts, each highlighting a different product he sells. He has them scheduled out to post one per day. However, once it gets through all the posts, those posts will automatically repeat. Before, he was taking the time to do all of this manually. Now, he has an automated way of consistently driving traffic back to his site and those products.We have a radio station that used to manually copy and paste the same social media posts about certain programs starting at various times of the day, every Monday through Friday. Now with OneUp, they just set those post to repeat, freeing hours of tedious labor every week. ",,,," We now have hundreds of paying customers, so word of mouth marketing is really starting to take off now, and new customers are coming every day. We are 100% bootstrapped and profitable. We want to keep the current momentum going, while continuing to make improvements to the product based on customer feedback. ",," OneUp started in 2017 as a side-project for Vishal, which he worked on overnights and weekends while working at his day job. He is the technical co-founder, and has built everything himself using the domain expertise he picked up during an internship at a social media management company a few years ago. The original product started as a very minimal MVP, and went through many different iterations in terms of landing page copy, UI, onboarding process, flow, and functionality, all in search of product-market fit. The product was ultimately too complicated and confusing, so we decided to strip it down and aim for an extremely easy and intuitive experience so that first-time users can jump in and immediately understand how to use OneUp"," I was listening to Brian Dean, the founder of Backlinko, on a podcast recently and he talked about how he consistently gets his content to rank near the top of Google for his target keywords. The answer: Create something 10x better than what currently exists. I decided to take this approach for OneUp. When you Google ""social media scheduling tools"", you find lists of the ""Top 10 Social Media Management Tools"". How could I make something 10x better? Create a spreadsheet of EVERY single social media scheduling tool. So I took the time to compare the free plan (if any), starting price, and social networks of 90 different scheduling tools and put them in a Google Sheet. I shared this spreadsheet to a few Facebook Groups and subreddits centered around social media marketing, and these are the types of comments I would get: It has kind of caught fire and has received consistent traffic. Because OneUp is frozen to the top row of the sheet, it has brought in a respectable amount of quality traffic and signups in the first couple weeks of its existence: ...and also led to many visits on the blog post version of this list that I created and linked at the top of the Google Sheet.  Quora We have also found that Quora has been a great source of quality traffic. There are tons of questions with people asking for recommendations on different types of social media tools, so we are working hard to get OneUp near the top of the answers. Almost everyone coming from Quora represents a high-quality potential user, because they are actively seeking out a solution to their problem.  Manually monitoring Facebook groups and subreddits Other more manual efforts have led to paying customers as well, such as actively monitoring relevant Facebook Groups and subreddits for people asking for solutions to their problems: It turns out our image scheduling Chrome extension was the perfect fit for what this redditor was looking for, and has since become a paying customer. Same for this person in a Facebook Group: "," In 2012, I graduated from a small school in Pennsylvania called Grove City College, where I got my degree in finance. After graduating, I worked a few jobs in corporate finance and absolutely hated it. The sad part was that almost everyone I worked with also hated their jobs, and would trudge through their misery week after week, motivated only by the promise of a weekend off, or those glorious 2–3 weeks of vacation each year. The golden handcuffs are a very real thing. A few years ago, I had the opportunity to leave the corporate finance world and join a startup that a former classmate from college was starting. I came on board to help with marketing, but took a pretty substantial pay cut from what I was making before, as the founder of that company had only raised a small friends-and-family seed round to get things up and running. That ultimately didn’t end up working out, as we ran through the money faster than projected — the development of the site and mobile app was being outsourced to freelancers, and, fun fact, those development costs never really end. However, that role gave me great experience, and made me realize that it’s possible to actually enjoy work. Prior to that, I had never felt that my contributions actually made a difference in the large organizations I was working for. After spending a little time doing some freelance marketing and working on a few no-code side projects, I joined my co-founder Vishal Kumar at OneUp. We created OneUp to help increase the visibility of content on social media. Whenever you share something on social media, it is typically only seen by roughly 5% of your followers. Despite this, most people put crazy amounts of time and effort into creating social media posts and share it just once across their social media channels, guaranteeing that most of their followers will never see that post. OneUp helps these people by automatically driving traffic and engagement to the content that they have worked so hard on producing. "," Yes! I wanted to take advantage of being small and, as Paul Graham has famously said, “do things that don’t scale” by really wow-ing the users during the onboarding experience. First, I tried sending a personal email to each person after they signed up. That failed miserably. Maybe it was the copy I used, or maybe I didn’t personalize it enough, but I got virtually zero responses from it. I believe most people thought it was just another automated email. So I started thinking about different ways I could make it 100% clear that this a personalized message from the co-founder. My idea: I would record a short personal video using Loom, introducing myself and thanking them by name for signing up. This made a huge difference! You can’t really fake or automate this, which has led to over a 50% response rate to these welcome videos. People are normally taken aback by the fact that someone took the time to record a personal video message for them. There are 3 great things about this: It starts the relationship on a great note, and lets the user see that there is a real person behind the company.It makes getting feedback much easier. You’ve already opened up a conversation channel, and built at least some rapport. I’ve had people take the time to let me know that they will not be using the service, when they would normally just leave without notice. This has given us the opportunity to figure out what went wrong, or what features they were looking for that we didn’t have.Some people are so wowed by the personal touch that they’ve shared it on Twitter. Here are some of the responses I have received: Recording each video only takes about 15 seconds, so while it may not scale forever, there is no reason why we can’t continue it into at least the near future. This personalization helped us land Nir Eyal as a paying customer. For those that are unfamiliar, Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, which is co-written by Product Hunt founder Ryan Hoover. It helped that I already owned his book and was holding it in the personal video I sent him. He was really blown away by the personal touch, and agreed to give a testimonial that we added to our landing page: "," Vishal originally launched OneUp on Product Hunt, where it did pretty well and attracted some of the first paying customers. This was a major form of validation because you never really know if you have a good product unless someone is willing to pay you for it. We did, however, have some validation going in from some of our competitors, like Hootsuite and Buffer, who do millions of dollars in annual recurring revenue. The initial launch provided the opportunity to talk to customers, work out the bugs, make improvements, and see what kind of features users are looking for. Virtually everything we build is the direct result of customer feedback. For example, Hacker Noon, one of the largest tech publications in the world, was looking for a way to automatically post to their social media page every time they published a new blog post – and also have each post repeat again once a month for the next 3 months on social media. We could definitely build this, but we wanted to be sure that we were building something that customers actually value enough that they are willing to pay for it. So we worked out a custom pricing agreement and secured payment before ever working on this feature. A week later, OneUp made it easy to import any blog, podcast, or YouTube RSS feed, and have posts from those feeds automatically shared at your preferred intervals across your social media accounts. Most recently, we launched OneUp 2.0 on Product Hunt in September of 2018, and finished fourth for the day with over 550 upvotes. This led to over 1400 visitors on launch day and the following couple days. While the Product Hunt performance provides great social proof and will probably serve as a small source of traffic moving forward, it is not a long term plan for success as many people on Product Hunt aren’t in our target market.

169,openmargin," Hey, thanks for inviting me. I’m Marc Köhlbrugge. I’m the founder of BetaList (discover tomorrow’s startups, today), WIP (community of makers), and Startup Jobs (job board for startups). I grew up in the Netherlands, but nowadays I travel around quite a bit. I’m currently in sunny Portugal. Besides the three products I mentioned above, I’ve pursued many other ideas as well. Some successful, others not so much.  One of the products that didn’t work out in the end, but I still learned a lot from is *openmargin. It was a social e-reader app that turned your favorite books into small communities. We added a social layer to every book, allowing you to discuss with other readers. It was innovative at the time, and still one of the most exciting products I’ve worked on, but ultimately it didn’t live up to its potential. I was one of the founders together with two friends. We shared a lot of responsibilities, but I’d say my main role was technical and design. "," A lot of things went very well. We got a ton of opportunities, but I think we started to lose our motivation after multiple years of hard work without seeing clear adoption. We talked to the team at Oprah’s book club to see if we could partner somehow. Which would have been huge. Samsung proposed a deal where we’d be the default e-reader app on the first Galaxy Note. We had calls with notable authors like Kevin Kelly who seemed interested in working together. We even got invited to the most popular talk show on Dutch television (‘De Wereld Draait Door’), but we couldn’t attend because of a scheduling conflict. Our team had grown larger over time as well, which I think we didn’t manage well. One condition of the second subsidy we got, is that we’d form a foundation with outside board members. At the same time, we hired some freelancers to help with the app development. So we grew from 3 friends to a team of 7. Three co-founders, two additional board members who ultimately had control over many business decisions, and two freelancers who did a lot of the actual work. I think everyone did their best, but ultimately having so many cooks in the kitchen ultimately slowed things down to a crawl. ‍  I think we lacked the “ship it fast and early” mentality leading us to focus too much on vision and not enough on actually testing our ideas in the market. Second, I think we were too early. Most publishers were still scared of publishing ebooks. Let alone allowing people to freely share excerpts, etc. ‍ Third, Amazon’s monopoly makes it impossible for a newcomer to innovate in this market. You’d either need to raise a lot of funding and start knocking on publisher’s doors to partner with, or you’d need to collaborate with an existing player that already has the connections. For example, I could see a publisher like O’Reilly launch their app. Alternatively, if anyone can make the all-you-can-eat Spotify model work for books, I think that would be a great platform as well to integrate social e-reader functionality into. After about three years of trying to get traction, I think we as a team slowly started to lose motivation and each got pulled away by our other work commitments. For me, those were my other two startups at the time PR.co and BetaList. Although it wasn’t the success we hoped for, I look back at *openmargin with fond memories. We learned a lot, had fun doing it, and its ultimate failure was certainly not due to a lack of trying.  ",,,,," Very slowly. We spent many months just coming up with ideas without really implementing any. Everything was very well thought through (e.g. I vividly remember weeks of discussing in the detail the pros and cons of having threaded discussions versus a flat hierarchy), but it took a long time for us to implement any of it. I think that happened for multiple reasons. The most important one was that our team wasn’t as balanced as it should have been. We had a philosophical foundation and could discuss anything from the tiniest details to our grand vision of the interconnection of texts and the human species. How we could add a social, annotation layer to anything in the world, not just books. It’s great to think big, but you still need to start by taking small steps. That took us a while to understand. Fortunately, we had a deadline for the graduation project, so in the last week or two, we quickly put a prototype together with our main ideas. ‍ When we graduated we raised a total of €130.000 in subsidies. That’s where our philosophical ability paid off. We were very good at sharing our vision and getting people excited to play a part in it. The subsidies came with their deadlines, which again helped us execute. We launched publicly in 2011 at The Next Web conference in Amsterdam. About two and half years after we started. ‍"," To get our first very beta testers, I started a separate website called BetaList which features up-and-coming startups. It was pretty easy to get press coverage for that (I wrote about it in detail) which in turn lead to a lot of traffic for *openmargin. Of course, that initial press coverage only gets you so far. And while people seemed excited about the idea, this wasn’t reflected in user adoption. We quickly figured out that an e-reader app is only as good as the books you can read in them. And it was very difficult or sometimes even impossible to get your ebooks into our app. The ebook market was completely dominated by Amazon and there’s no way other apps than their own can open up Kindle ebooks. Their monopoly and use of DRM was a huge hurdle and are still today for any startup trying to innovate in this market. At the time the big publishers were still hesitant when it came to ebooks. So partnering with them seemed impossible. Fortunately, authors and indie publishers were excited. So we partnered with a bunch to make their books accessible within *openmargin. This also solved the chicken-and-egg problem where we might have 100 users, but they are all reading different books. We need a group of people all reading the same book, for the concept to work. This is something we might have figured out sooner (and not after 3 years haha) if we shipped faster rather than thinking too far ahead coming up with the ideal scenario. Anyway, starting with a handful of pre-loaded books kinda worked. But the chance that someone who downloaded our app happened to want to read one of those books was pretty low. We were in a few years in by this point, without any real traction. It was the subsidies that kept us alive while we each also had other jobs to pay the bills. I even co-founded a second startup in the meantime. "," *openmargin started as our graduation project at university back in 2009. Every school project always ended up getting shelved at the end of the semester, so we want to do something different this time. Build a business we got continue after graduating. One question we kept coming back to is how we’d present ourselves on the job market. Our study was a blend of many disciplines, from design to software development, to project management and branding strategy. How do you fit that on a business card? After many brainstorming sessions, we realized that showcasing your book collection and the notes you make within them, is a really good representation of who you are as a person. This eventually led to the idea of publicizing your notes and highlights. Initially, we came up with an iPhone app you could write notes in while reading a book. But when the first iPad came out, we saw the potential of it becoming an e-reader. So we pivoted to an iPad app instead. Allowing you to make notes right inside the book. ‍"," Looking at the founding team’s strengths, I think we would have been better of selling more of a consultancy-type service rather than a software product.

170,pactero," My name is Wes Wagner, and I'm currently working on Rarely Decaf. Rarely Decaf is a consultancy and education company focused on helping startups and SMBs learn to leverage the power of Airtable so they can save time and scale impact. ‍"," The biggest assumption I made was that if I created this tool, it will unlock a supply of thousands of entrepreneurs that want to launch an education business and monetize using income share agreements.  I confused that initial launch with market validation. I was getting emails and popular podcasts were mentioning us. But it wasn't market validation -- it was vanity. ‍  I went through the process of trying to focus on one specific pain point the product solved. Contract management? Student credit checks? I realized that even if the business solved all those things, that didn’t change the fact that there wasn’t a market of people that wanted to monetize through income share agreements. It's simply not the best business model for an online education entrepreneur.  In November 2020, I still had a bunch of money from investors. We tried to pivot and for the next two months, I drove myself crazy. I became depressed, stressed, and anxious because I was losing the reason why I started the business. I started the business to make a huge impact and pursue my curiosities. And I was no longer doing that. I was trying to think of the investors and trying to think of some path towards a $10 billion outcome. I realized my interest and the investor interest were no longer aligned. My primary goal was not to create a $10 billion company -- it was to solve problems through entrepreneurship and pursue my curiosities. At that point, I shut down the business and returned the remaining capital.",,,,," After leaving Microverse, I navigated an idea maze because I didn't know what I was going to create yet. I created a bunch of different landing pages and tried to understand what resonated with entrepreneurs that were building online schools. I finally found that it was a pain to manage income share agreements. ‍ I jumped to building the product instead of trying to solve the problem in a non-scalable way and then building the product from that. I knew how to build the MVP using no-code and low-code tools, so I went straight to the building phase."," As soon as I launched the beta and the idea on Twitter, it blew up. Investors started reaching out and the tweet went semi-viral because “income share agreements” were such a hot topic. A lot of people that signed up were thinking about starting an education business and monetizing through an income share agreement. From that point, it was a slow realization many people were interested in monetizing through income share agreements, few people committed to it. It turns out the market was just too small, and if you commit to using income share agreements, you didn't need our product to start. You could use a template contract and send it via email and just do everything else manually. Now, people would need our software when scaling. But there were just a handful of companies that needed it. We were trying to sell a SaaS instead of trying to sell consulting services where we’d help build these systems for them. "," In college, I realized I could learn a lot more outside the traditional education system than within it, so I started working remotely for startups. And after I finished college, I got excited about working for startups in the education space. I ended up working for a startup called Microverse, which is an online school for software developers that doesn't charge them until they get a job. That business model is called an income share agreement. I joined as the first employee and I didn't know the founder outside of Twitter. The business was unique for two reasons:  1) the education was almost exclusively done through peer-to-peer dynamics and 2) it was the only education program in the world using a global income share agreement. By the time I left, about 14 months later, they had students from more than a hundred countries and helped folks learn software development and get jobs earning on average three times their previous income. It was inspiring to see. I wanted to 100x that impact, and that’s where the idea for Pactero came from. It was a platform to simplify the process of managing income share agreements and contracts. ‍"," Nothing. I'm incredibly fortunate someone else believed in me. It was validating and then gave me the chance to learn and make these mistakes. And as a first-time founder, I'd studied the content and podcasts and the knowledge in the space. But experiencing the pains and the problems was so invaluable to my future entrepreneurial endeavors. I wouldn't trade this experience for anything.  It helped me learn a lot about myself, my motivations. I realized not every business should be venture-backed. I'm grateful for the experience and grateful for the investment.  ",, You can check out my new business Rarely Decaf.

"," In July I applied for two accelerators. That was what I was supposed to do. I got into the Network Catalyst accelerator by Village Global. It was a $150,000 check. That was the only money we ever took in. From July to January the company burned about $55,000. The majority of the money was spent on salaries. I took a salary of around $50,000 a year. We paid for lawyers. I paid for a lot of no/low-code SaaS. I brought a co-founder and paid him to fly to the United States and stay with me. But at the end of the day, most of the fees were paying for me to be able to sustain working on this, paying for the tools we were using to build the product, and paying for legal fees for things that we just didn't need. We were able to convert one customer for an enterprise custom solution deal. The contract we were getting was going to be $2,000, but it was pretty much consulting. We were a venture-backed business. We shouldn’t be doing that, so we stopped the project before it started and did one consulting call for a hundred dollars. There was also another consulting call for...another $100?

171,pagestead," My name is Mattijs Naus (typically go simply by “Matt”), originally from The Netherlands but living in Thailand for the past 13 years. I run a software business with a fully remote team and our flagship product is called Pagestead. Pagestead is a self-hosted, fully white-labeled website builder. We sell licenses for the software to companies around the world (typically a one-off fee). Additionally, we sell subscriptions giving access to continued support and software updates. With me being the founder, I take on a number of roles, jumping around between front-end development, support, marketing, business and customer development, etc. ‍",," As mentioned earlier, FUD has been, and still is a big issue from to time. Since you’re entering uncharted waters almost on a daily basis, you’re often on your own in figuring out what to do next or how to handle a certain issue. Sure, there are places you can turn to for advice, however, although well meant, advice is always based on the giver’s personal situation and circumstances and does not always help you. Another big issue for us at the moment is dealing with and scaling customer support. Up until recently, I and my main developer were handling most of the support requests. This obviously is not a good thing, as it drastically slows down our development efforts and delays future releases. As we need to reach product market asap, we’re scrambling to move both of us away from support. Other than that, we deal with the typical obstacles any software company faces. Things like deciding which features to implement first, working on documentation, documenting internal processes, implementing automated QA, etc. Fortunately, most of these obstacles are of technical nature and fixing technical issues is what we coders do best ) Other personal obstacles for me are things like loneliness. Although it’s super easy to connect with people and gather like-minded people around you, building a bootstrapped business as a solo-founder is an inherently lonely undertaking. Nobody but you fully understand everything that’s on your plate. It’s up to you, and you alone, to make the decisions. ‍  We have spent a bunch of time and money on things which, in hindsight, we shouldn’t have. We wasted time and money on building a collection of 600 templates, which we never were able to complete (due to a variety of reasons). We have made some small “mistakes”, where we spend some time and resources developing features we did not end up releasing. Sometimes because halfway through the feature we found out it would end up being too costly or the demand was not as big as initially thought. Other mistakes were made releasing features too early, while they were not yet stable enough and not tested thoroughly. We probably also started focusing on automated QA a bit too late. One thing we got blindsided by was the large support burden we didn’t anticipate the support demand would be this big. I guess you could call this a mistake of sorts I probably should have done a better job cultivating our mailing list since we launched. Sending out regular drip campaigns with tutorials, how-to’s and other useful content could have been beneficial. ‍",,," Some of the personal disadvantages I am facing arise from me being a coder/product person at heart. I used to be most happy and content when locked up in my office and building cool stuff. Talking to customers, making myself available to my team, doing interviews, etc are all things that did not come naturally. I had, and still have to, work at these things to move the business forward. When looking at the team at large, the same applies. We’re all coders/technical people with limited business experience. This means we all have to get outside of our comfort zones from time to time. As for the market in which Pagestead operates the site builder market itself is highly competitive: there are numerous, well-established players with whom we are competing. Some of the disadvantages Pagestead has compared to competitors, include the fact that we’re relative new, with a young product and the fact that we’re selling a self-hosted product instead of a traditional SaaS product."," It took us about 9 months (roughly) to create Pagestead before we launched in the spring of 2017. However, this first version used a lot of code of a previous version, so it wasn’t like we built it from scratch. We also were not working on it full-time (we all had other jobs during those months). While building the first version, we were a team of three: myself, one back-end developer and another front-end developer. The first version of Pagestead was pretty lame to be put it bluntly. We really launched with the absolute bare minimum in terms of features. Thankfully, we have a large list of email subscribers, existing customers and other helpful people in our network who helped us determine which initial features we needed to have. It’s thanks to our early customers who believed in us and pre-ordered or purchased during the early days that we’re in business today! Below is an image of the first landing page for Pagestead (back when it was still called SB Pro): There were, and honestly still are, tons of doubts about whether we’re building a viable business. Just a few days back I was asking my wife if she thought there was some magic number of customers, revenue or profit which would finally remove the doubt and confirm we have a sustainable business. Unfortunately, we were not able to come up with this magic number :) Before launching, we had a pre-order page allowing people to pre-order at a nice discount of 20%. Back then, we said the magic number was $10,000. If we were able to achieve $10,000 in pre-orders, we’d conclude this was enough proof the idea was viable and enough people would be willing to pay for this software. When we reached that number, I still had my doubts. We ended up doing just over $30,000 in pre-orders. The doubts were probably slightly less, but definitely not completely gone. It’s not just doubts about whether we’re building a viable business. It’s doubts about new features to build, how to scale customer support, whether to hire that new employee, etc. You learn to deal with it though. I acknowledge the doubt and then cast it aside and move forward making decisions to best of my capabilities with the information I have at that moment. One of the biggest obstacles we faced while building Pagestead was FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). While we were working on the first release, I constantly worried we were not moving fast enough, we wouldn’t be able to attract additional paying customers after launching, not being able to make enough money to support everyone, etc. It’s that annoying nagging voice in the back of your mind. I am sure we overcame a whole bunch of smaller obstacles the past year, but none of them seem worth reminding. I can honestly say that the process of building the initial version of Pagestead was not an enjoyable experience, in the slightest. It was an intense and stressful episode and there were plenty of moments I was seriously considering abandoning the project and moving onto something else. I guess the thing that kept me going was that on some level I knew it would all be worth it. Additionally, having customers willing to pay us money for a product that has not yet been completed was a huge driver as well. When it comes to setting the prices for Pagestead, it was really just a matter of experience, talks with customers (and knowing what kind of customer we would be selling this to) and intuition. I don’t believe we have our pricing nailed at the moment, and we’ll likely be making some changes in the near future. We’ll use the information we have at that time, try making some changes and see what kind of response we’ll be getting back from our customers. I am personally not a big fan of big public launches and we never did this for Pagestead. Instead, we launched quietly to our mailing list. That was all really. A simple email to let everyone know we have finally launched. I love the idea of stair-stepping the launch process and doing multiple small-scale launches. So, whenever we release an update, we do a small launch by email, Twitter, Facebook, etc. We have had a number of people asking if they could “hunt” us on PH, however, we’re holding off until we’re closer to product market fit and have made some other improvements.",," I studied both business and CS in university before dropping out and moving to Thailand. During my first few years in Thailand, I was working for a travel company doing web development and other IT-related tasks. I had a tremendous freedom during this job to start projects and experiment with things. This allowed me to grow my coding chops as well as create a taste for starting projects and side-businesses. After leaving this job, I have started numerous projects and business (ending up selling one as well). Most of these projects didn’t result in anything great, but I simply enjoyed creating stuff. Since not all of these projects were generating income, I was often doing consulting and freelancing work on the side. I guess you could say most of the projects I started “failed”. However, I don’t really like that word, as they don’t feel like failures too. All of them were awesome learning experiences and great fun to build. One of my more recent “failures” is a product named “Failswitch”. It was a tool which would prevent your website from being down, ever. I think the reason this failed was due to the fact I was not able to define a clear audience for this, beyond simply “people with a website” (which is way too broad). This pretty much ingrained the idea that for a small, bootstrapped business to succeed, having a clearly defined market in the early days, as well as a channel to reach them, is very important. Another hugely important lesson I learned after numerous built-out products without any customers, is that validation before the building is critical. It’s hard, especially for us coders, not to right away dive into code when having an idea for a business or project, however doing so almost always results in a product without users/customers.  I was also active selling WordPress themes and HTML templates on ThemeForest during these years. This lead me to start building my first website builder script. It was mostly aimed at HTML template sellers, allowing them to bundle the script with their products and thus allowing customers to easily modify these HTML templates (even to this day, there are still numerous HTML templates available on ThemeForest which use our script). I quickly started seeing other types of customers buying the simple site builder script like web development agencies, marketing firms, hosting companies and internet marketers. We started seeing a demand for this type of product (with numerous additional features our product didn’t have at the time). I started building additional site builder scripts with better features and started selling those as well on CodeCanyon. This was a nice business for several years with decent monthly income (around $5,000 a month). However, at some point, I started growing tired with selling through a market site like CodeCanyon. We had now ways to contact our customers and we starting seeing CodeCanyon’s parent company Envato moving into a direction we did not like. So, we (at this point I assembled a small team) decided to build and sell the next iteration of our site builder tool, now named Pagestead, outside of the Envato ecosystem. This turned out to be an excellent decision, as we’re now 100% in control and are making more money than we did selling on the Envato sites. Below you’ll see a screenshot of Pagestead’s page builder interface: ‍", I would probably start spending more time on documentation early on and start implementing automated QA sooner. I would also spend more time working on email marketing and customer relations.  ," Not an awful lot to be quite honest. We’re still generating a healthy number of leads from traffic coming from other products in our portfolio. Additionally, we have done some SEO and content marketing efforts which are now, after several months, finally starting to deliver some results. We have done some small experiments with paid acquisition, however until we reach product-market fit, or get very close, we’re holding off serious investments in marketing Pagestead. We’re quite comfortable with the current growth rate. It allows to put critical parts of the business in place, such as customer support, in preparation for faster growth in the future.  We have been seeing traction since before launching. Since we were quite successful with pre-orders and cultivating a mailing list before launch, we have been gaining new customers pretty much since day one after launching.

172,park-io," Hi! My name is Mike Carson and I am a computer programmer and identify as a hacker. I am 41 years old and I am based in the Philadelphia area. A few years ago, I built park.io. park.io is a service that allows you to backorder domains that have expired and will be available for registration again soon. It focuses on ""hacker"" TLDs (top level domains), like .io, .ly, .me and .to. There can be a lot of competition to get good expiring domains, and I've built scripts to accomplish this. I don't really have a job title, since I am the only employee. I guess ""founder"" is best. As the saying goes ""a founder wears all hats"" - so my job duties are basically everything that needs to be done. ‍",," One thing I have learned with park.io is that it can often seem like there is a big obstacle that is going to bring down the whole business, and yet usually you can find a way around it. One example is the .io registry decided to sell their own backorders only a few months after I started park.io. I thought I would surely have to close the site and quit, because how could I compete with the registry? Luckily our systems were different enough that there was still value in the service that park.io was providing. Also, I was able to incorporate their system and leverage it with our own. What I learned from this and other obstacles is that being a hacker with programming is similar to hacking a business to make it work. It's about being resourceful - you just need to find a way to make it work with the situation you find yourself in. ‍  The worst mistakes, in my opinion, are the mistakes that affected the users in a negative way. Like one time I sent a hundred duplicate emails to a user, or one time a user was charged three times for one order. Things like this cause me a lot of pain. I want to be helpful to my users and provide them with a service that makes their lives easier or better, so it hurts me to make mistakes that do the opposite of this. With mistakes like these I always try to reach out personally and be very honest about the situation, and I usually credit their account or offer something like this. I hope to turn it into something good for them. It is difficult for me to come up with mistakes, mostly because I believe that everything happens for a reason and even the things that seem to be the worst are actually great things. But one other thing I can think of is pretty early on I listed the company for sale on Empire Flippers. I thought to myself ""why not? There isn't really any risk and maybe I will sell the company."" But I think this was a mistake because it ended up taking a lot of time and energy. There were several calls, and many questions to be answered, many reports to gather. It was a lot of time and energy that I could have spent on the company and code. I would recommend to others not to list their company for sale unless they are sure they want to sell and are willing to devote the time to it. I was never really that interested in selling the company, and thankfully I did not sell it at the time. ‍",,," I am very introverted and sometimes have a hard time expressing my opinions to others. This is probably part of the reason I have not built a team for park.io. Perhaps I could do more with a team - it can be difficult as the only person doing everything for the company. A big disadvantage is not having a second opinion or a second set of eyes to review code and business decisions. My wife helps me a lot, but she isn't a developer and can't review the code."," It started as simple scripts to check when expired domains would be deleted and available for registration again. I would just hand-register these domains when they became available. I got some really great domains this way. Eventually, my manual registrations were not fast enough, as someone else was doing it automatically with a script and was able to register domains before I could get them. I reached out to the guy - a German programmer – and we chatted a lot about it. It was interesting because we were the only two people in the world who had decided to do this, so we had something very much in common. Yet, we also were competitors. Eventually, I got to the point where I was able to get every expiring .io domain that I wanted, so I decided to sell it as a service on park.io. Since I already had the infrastructure in place to grab the domains quickly as they became available, it was simply a matter of setting up a user interface and tying it together with the backend. It was a week or two of grunt work. I remember the quote ""Rome wasn't built in a day"" going through my head a lot during that time. Then I launched park.io in June 2014. The initial product was pretty bare bones, but it provided the user a way to backorder domains and manage the domains that they owned. My goal was to just get the most basic, usable version live, and then to automate the things that people used the most. I think probably the biggest doubt I had at the beginning was in regards to the ethics of the service. Was I just a domain squatter? Was I supporting domain squatters? Eventually, after seeing how happy people were to buy the domains, I realized it must be doing something good. One time I received a thank you card and gift in the mail from a happy customer who was able to get a domain for their business. I think a lot of this lead me to realize the importance of having happy users. I think it is really important and makes the business and your life so much better. As for pricing, I wasn't sure what to charge. I remember getting advice from a Wharton professor, who had studied pricing for his entire career, and his advice was something like ""if you aren't pricing it so high that people turn away because it is so expensive, then you aren't pricing it high enough."" So, I thought $99 was a good number because it was pretty high, but still in the 2-digit range. Honestly, I didn't think about it that much, but luckily it worked out pretty well.",," I'm a hacker and spend a lot of time reading Hacker News and building projects that I think are fun and interesting. To do this, you need domain names. One day I was looking for a domain name and found that it had expired. I did a lot of research to see how I could get it. I didn't get it, but it lead me to explore the domain name system in more depth. I started park.io in my spare time while I was working full time at WizeHive. I co-founded WizeHive and was CTO there for several years. I quit last summer to focus on park.io and other projects for Humbly. I failed at a million other projects before park.io. This is the advice I give other entrepreneurial-leaning hackers: Launch a lot of different things. 99% will fail, but there will be one that is a hit. It is obvious when it doesn't work, and it is obvious when it does work. Try a lot of things and when you get the one that works, focus on it for a while. As a developer, there isn't a lot of risk to launching a software service. Mostly it is just a risk of time, but even if nothing comes of it, you get the experience of trying. And the potential reward is huge. It is a good risk/reward bet to keep launching projects.  In the case of park.io, I didn't really start with an idea. It was more of just doing things I was interested in during my spare time. Eventually, I had done enough work on my own that I realized I could set it up as a service. ‍"," I think a lot of life has to do with your current mindset. I think most of the failed projects from my earlier years had a lot to do with how desperately I wanted them to be successful. It is like reaching out for a balloon, only to push it away with your fingertips. At some point just before park.io, I started to realize that I didn't need anything else in my life to be happy, and suddenly a successful project happened. I don't think it is a coincidence or just an indirect outcome of a positive attitude. I think it is literally a direct result of this realization. One of my projects for Humbly is a new religion I started. You can read more about it here. ‍"," I never did much advertising. I feel like this is one indicator that your project is going to be successful. If you don't have to do any advertising and you get more and more users every day, then that is a good sign. I put up a parked page that linked to park.io for every domain that we were able to catch, and this lead to many of the first users. I was surprised when I launched it and I had a couple of orders the first day. It just happened like that - each day a few more users would sign up and place orders. I haven't done much to grow park.io. I have tried to make the service work really well and I have added some TLDs. I have also done some interviews. But other than that, I don't think I have done anything else - it has grown by word of mouth and I think just the growth of .io domains, in general, has helped the growth of park.io. I would advise hackers to simply focus on the product and put love into their product. Build it so that you have happy users. You can do some interviews or blog posts and put them on Hacker News, or things like this, but you shouldn't have to do too much or spend too much time or money on marketing. If it is one of the 1% of your projects destined to success, it should grow quickly on its own. ‍"," You can go to park.io and my parent company, Humbly. Thanks for reading!"," I would recommend to do a 10-day silent Vipassana meditation retreat. It had a huge positive impact on my life and I use what I learned from the course every day. There are no charges for the courses - not even to cover the cost of food and accommodation. It is non-sectarian, with no hidden agenda. You basically meditate for 12 hours a day - no reading, writing, talking, or listening to music, etc. It is kind of like meditation boot camp, and you really get an idea of what meditation can do for you and how to do it.

173,pathways," My name’s Sandip Sekhon, I’m 36, based in London, and my educational and professional working background is in finance and banking. That switched to Internet entrepreneurship 10 years ago, and I haven’t looked back! I’m currently the CEO and Founder of the pain therapy app Pathways. Pathways uses a natural, mind-body approach to help chronic pain patients get rid of persistent pain. We operate a freemium subscription model, backed by a money-back guarantee. ‍",," The biggest obstacle throughout the project was the technical build of the cross-platform apps. The next major challenge was creating all the content needed for Pathways. We needed to ensure the content was evidence-based, understandable by a large variety of people, and applicable to many different pain conditions. ‍  The biggest mistake was the somewhat rushed hire of our first React Native team. That set us back by almost a year. Although on the positive, this helped me to really understand the kind of team that would be needed to help this project excel. As a product, the disadvantages of it at the moment is that we haven’t run any medical trials that will help us quantify just how much it helps pain sufferers. That’s now a priority. ‍",, My vision is for Pathways to undoubtedly become the best digital pain product. Here are some of the improvements planned for the next 12 to 18 months to help that become a reality: Patient/Doctor Connect FacilitiesDoctor Dashboard to View Patient ProgressIn-App Social FeaturesOffering a wider range of exercise class optionsMedication Efficacy TrackingRelaxing VR ExperiencesHoping to triple our user base ‍,," I figured that the most accessible format for Pathways would be in an app format. So I began searching for suitable teams, whilst creating the content for our pain therapy program. The first version (MVP) of the app took 3 months to develop (longer than I’d like) but was good enough for us to gauge the response from potential customers. We ran some ads on Facebook, and to my delight, a handful of people were happy to pay for the premium content. And more importantly, we started getting reviews like this: “I've had years of back and neck pain that stopped me working. 6 weeks into this program and I'm having my first pain free moments. Thank you!” That’s when I knew this was definitely worth pursuing further. By this stage, I realized that in order to really build out a good app, we needed to switch the software our app ran on from Unity 3D to React Native. I hired a new team that I was confident would help us build out a market-ready version on React Native, but after 8 months, they failed to deliver. We had wasted thousands of pounds and precious time. If it wasn’t for my deep motivation on this project, I would have moved on at this stage. I took away what I could - some very valuable hiring lessons - and moved on. Thankfully, I found another team that I was a lot more confident in and they started to work to recover Pathways. It wasn’t easy, fast, or cheap, but we were moving in the right direction. After another 3 months of effort, we were able to release a stable version on React Native - although still a fairly basic app. I took an objective look at what it would really take to offer the best digital pain product, and we were still some way off. So my team and I started to develop ideas on how we can take this from a mediocre app to an amazing one. After another 9 months of development and content creation, just this week we released our best version yet. I’m finally confident in our product, and it’s the ability to really make a life-changing difference to pain sufferers. Here are some of the super cool things available in our latest version: Our audio pain relief program is now a video program.We have a brand new exercise, yoga, and physio area.Our new masterclasses go deep into specific healing topics.We offer an innovative way for users to track pain, and factors that affect wellbeing.We’ve added 100s of interesting and unique challenges to help people get past the pain. ‍",," My first major Internet business success was with the crowdfunding site GoGetFunding.com. It’s a business I continue to run, and I’m humbled to say that we’ve grown to be one of the largest fundraising sites out there, helping people raise millions each month for causes they care about. I’d tirelessly work on the site, and eventually, that led to chronic pain throughout both of my arms, diagnosed as Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). This left me unable to work, and even perform basic daily activities. I went through years of failed treatments, which culminated in two invasive and unnecessary surgeries on both of my arms. It’s only once I met a physiotherapist with knowledge of pain science that I was able to understand and treat my pain. She explained how due to years of pain and pain-anxiety, my nervous system had become overprotective and sensitized - causing pain at any hint of danger. I had to train my brain and body away from pain. I discovered that there are decades of science on central pain sensitization. I learned that when pain persists beyond three months, our brain and nervous system start to learn pain and irrespective of the condition of your body, you can continue feeling real pain long after an injury has healed. That didn’t mean the pain was all just in my head or that I could simply think it away. It meant that I needed to practice both mind and body techniques to train my nervous system to be less sensitive and protective. I finally understood how trying to find and fix ‘issues in the tissues’ that could explain the pain, was doomed to fail. No amount of physio, surgery, or diet changes could cure my pain. Instead, I had to tackle every thought, belief, and behavior that was keeping me locked in a pain cycle. Using evidence-based mind-body techniques, I was able to become 100% pain-free in just a couple of months. Life-changing. I realized just how many millions of people around the world continue to battle with chronic pain, which will fail to find relief unless they take a complete approach to pain treatment. This fuelled immense motivation to create a product that could take a skeptical pain sufferer like me, to being pain-free. There was nothing like that out there, and knowing a product like this could make a huge difference to so many people, I decided to create it."," If I was to do things differently, I would have started Pathways as a web-app. That would help us get to market much quicker and with fewer costs. However, on the flip side, we’ve now done the hard work by creating cross-platform apps. ‍"," When we initially released, Facebook ADs worked well and we were able to drive enough traffic in order to test whether or not the app works, and helps people. During the last few months, we’ve begun releasing a lot of in-depth pain science content on our blog. This has started to gain more and more traffic, which I believe (and hope) will continue into the future. By next month, we’d like to start running ads - beginning with a Universal App Campaign. And in 2-3 months, I believe we’ll be in a position to create regular good content for our YouTube channel. App subscribers have been organically growing (with revenue along with that). Although we’re still some way away from breaking even and the true test will be how well we’re able to convert traffic once we begin advertising. Even the initial marketing of this business versus previous ventures has helped me realize just how much Google, Facebook, and other traffic sources have changed over the years. You can no longer create something, publish a few articles, and hope to gain traffic. To survive and thrive, business owners truly need to create something great. You need to consistently put in the effort to make your product worth talking about, sharing, and linking to. You need to be a specialist in your area to reap the rewards. I see these increased barriers to entry as a good thing - fly-by-night operations have less chance of succeeding and businesses that make a real investment into their product and content will over time, make the most progress."," Pathways Homepage: Understand what our app does, and download it for iOS or Android Pathways Blog: This is where we’re producing most of our content.

174,patriot-chimney," Hi Rich, thanks for having me. As you mentioned, my name is Mitchell. I am 25 and the owner of Patriot Chimney, a chimney company in Roanoke, Virginia, while I actually work remote in Raleigh, NC. Patriot Chimney provides chimney and dryer cleaning, repair, and builds for residential and commercial clients. The chimney industry gets a bad wrap because a history of poor service, “professionals” selling unnecessary services, and a few other things that lead to distrust. So we are really trying to innovate and disrupt the status quo to make a better experience for our clients.  In this whole thing, I focus on building business strategy, marketing, and sales. My brother, Matt, and his friend, Billy, are the other two owners and they focus on the operations side, actually going out to the homes and performing services.  ‍",," There have been a ton of challenges and obstacles along the way. For starters, it’s never easy to have multiple owners, let alone 3, all of whom are pretty stubborn. This causes some issues where no one really wants to be told what to do and no one wants to tell any of the other owners what to do. Sometimes that creates some bottlenecks in communication, but the best way that we found was to just communicate. You have to talk to each other because you are going through this with several people. What we’ve done to sort of curb this is to have regular meetings, where we talk about upcoming projects, assign different action items, and hold each other accountable for the work. This helps keep us on track and continue to grow.  Another huge challenge that we face and continue to face is the fact that I have another job and I live in a whole other state. I put a lot of focus on Patriot Chimney, even when I’m at my job because I have a goal to eventually work for my company, but there are a lot of items on my docket and a to-do list that has to be placed on the back burner since I simply don’t have time. It’s also very difficult managing this company, a full-time job, a gym schedule, and my personal relationships, but I do it with a very well kept calendar. I use Trello for larger picture items and Asana for daily to do (and groceries). I have my time blocked so I know what I’m working on and when I’m working on it.  One disadvantage to our company that I mentioned earlier is that I’m in North Carolina, while the rest of the company is in Virginia. The problem with this is that there can be sort of a disconnect between me and the rest of the team since I don’t see what goes on every day. I try to make recommendations that, in my head seem to make sense, but don’t make sense at all for those actually doing the work. For example, when we were getting started, I wanted to get rid of paper condition reports, so we bought iPads and an app that would allow upload the condition reports, write on them with a stylus, upload to our Dropbox account, and then email them to the client. The issue with this is that it is very difficult to carry an iPad around when you’re climbing ladders and walking around on a steep roof.  What we do now is if I have an idea, I run it by Matt and Billy to see what they think. Lucky for me, both of them are ex-Marines (or once a Marine, always a Marine?) and they really don’t mind telling me that my idea doesn’t make sense. In all seriousness, they are both very strong critical thinkers and have a great way of analyzing these ideas and thinking of situations that I hadn’t even thought of. ",," We are very goal-oriented and we have several goals for the future. This fiscal year, which began August 1, we are hoping to reach $350K. Currently, we are a little more than 35% to our goal and right on track to hit that. We are really ramping up our busy season right now. As far as profit is concerned, our goal is to stay at about the same 8% as last year since we are still in growth mode and bootstrapping the whole thing.  Beyond revenue and profit, we’re also looking at expanding our services to the tri-city area of Bristol-Kingsport-Johnson City. The reason is that it’s pretty close to us, there are a lot of people that live in the area, and there aren’t that many CSIA certified chimney pros in the area. So we think it’s the perfect place to set up shop.  Also, we are looking at doing a lot more work within the commercial kitchen exhaust space. We did it a few months ago but realized that we weren’t in any position to add that service because Matt and Billy would work all day servicing chimneys, then go to a restaurant after closing hours to service the kitchen exhaust. They would get a couple of hours of sleep (if that…) then go back out for the chimney work. It was insane and not sustainable at all. So we scrapped the whole idea. This year, 2020, we are going to hire some more people to handle that side of the business.  In addition to hiring folks for kitchen exhaust work, we’ll start to hire more chimney technicians, but focus on hiring people that are skilled in other areas, such as masonry.  My personal goal is to quit my job and finally come on full time. I have been working on this, skipping out on getting paid (except on a few occasions), and putting all of my money back into Patriot Chimney. If everything works out as planned, I’ll only have a few more months with a separate 9-5 job. ‍",," When we got started, I was in between jobs after moving from Kentucky back to North Carolina. I was applying for jobs but still had a ton of free time. During that period, I built our current website and designed the logo. I also designed all of our condition reports that we fill out during each inspection for chimney and dryer vent services. I set up all of our email services, set up the phone system.  Meanwhile, Matt and Billy figured out how and where to buy the van and equipment. We made a list of everything we’d need for every job that we’d eventually have and figured out what we needed to buy now versus what we could hold off until later. We utilized our connections to see what kind of discounts we could get, especially considering all three of us were out of jobs at this point and we really needed to be lean.   For pricing, we had a pretty good idea what our competitors priced, since both Matt and Billy worked for the competitor for a while. We didn’t want it to be exactly the same as their former employer, but we did want competitive pricing so we called all of the other chimney companies and simply asked their price for their most basic services, like a chimney sweep or inspection. With that information, we had an idea for how we needed to price our services. The largest obstacles that we ran into during this whole process was that we didn’t have enough money and I was in Raleigh while the company was starting in Roanoke. We borrowed a lot of money from family and used our credit cards to buy most of the equipment and the van. We would also buy only what we needed when we needed it. This means that we didn’t buy all of the items on our list of must-haves at once we waited until a job required a specific tool before we bought it. Being in Raleigh was very difficult, but we stayed in touch and spoke every single day while we launched. We created tasks and used Monday to keep up with tasks and hold each other accountable.  ‍ While the process of getting it started was definitely stressful - unemployed and starting a business - I have to admit that I loved every minute of it. I mentioned that I’m sort of a serial entrepreneur and I really love planning and executing a business idea from scratch and seeing it through to completion. I’m a very type A and thrive under stress (most of the time, at least). ",," I have been what many people call a “serial entrepreneur” for a few years now and I think it stemmed from a few different sources. When I was in college I was very involved in a lot of different extracurriculars and always had a full day of class, studying, internships, and meetings. Naturally, when I graduated, I had a lot of free time, even with a full time job. So I decided to start a housekeeping company in Asheville, where I grew up.  For a while, my brother and I talked about starting a business in Roanoke, where he lives. He was in the Marine Corps for 7 or 8 years and I guess he was sick of people telling him what to do. We tossed out ideas like another housekeeping company, a home health business, and even a landscaping company, but none of those stuck.  In 2017, Matt started working for a chimney company in Roanoke and began thinking this is a great industry to be in. It’s very profitable and you’re doing good work making homes safer. He really liked the company he worked for, but he noticed some inefficiencies and nobody listened to his ideas on how to improve the business. During this time, Matt and I would go back and forth about what he should do - either starting our business or continue waiting his turn to speak up about growing the company he worked for.  Eventually, a few of his paychecks bounced, so we decided it was a great time to start Patriot Chimney, so he got Billy, who also worked for the chimney company and served in the Marines with Matt, on board. They started doing a few jobs on the side and the company they worked for eventually caught wind and fired both Matt and Billy a couple of weeks after we started. Truthfully, the plan was to go slow and do work on the side until the other company went belly up. I think Matt and Billy getting fired was the right kick we needed.  ‍"," If we could do things differently, I would probably say that I would’ve gotten our operations software, Jobber sooner and we would’ve hired Kaylin sooner. When we first got started, Matt and Billy were working with pen and paper, answering calls, scheduling clients. I was working my job, filling out PDF proposals to add to Zoho Sign, then sending it off to the clients. Poor Matt and Billy, both of whom have small children, were working hours upon hours well after the jobs during the day were over just to call people back, submit the proposal info over to me, and prepare for the next day. Having something to organize all of that and Kaylin to send the quotes and answer phones, have been absolutely instrumental in our success. If it weren’t for those two pieces, I literally do not think our company would be where it is today.  "," The first thing that we did was make simple door hangers with a $25 discount for all services. We also offered free inspections to help get us business in the beginning. We posted on Porch and Thumbtack, which surprisingly was being underutilized by other chimney companies in our market, but used by a lot of customers in the area. We also made a huge effort to make our Yelp, Facebook, and Google Business page at least better than everyone else in the area and began paying for the Yelp ads pretty much right off the bat so we could be ranked higher on their pages.  Since Porch and Thumbtack wasn’t used by our competitors that often, it honestly wasn’t that long after we started until we actually picked up traction. In fact, in our first month, August 2018, we earned just shy of $12,000. This felt incredible since we built something from scratch that earned that much in its first month. I think our timing was just right for us as well since we got started just before the burn season, which is the busiest time for all chimney companies. There’s a good possibility that our customers called us last and went with our service since we could put them on the schedule sooner than our competitors. Now we’re already booked through January and have February closing up as well.  Currently, we don’t offer free inspections or post on Porch or Thumbtack as much anymore (we’re more selective), but we still use door hangers, Yelp, Facebook, and Google like the beginning. We do focus a lot on Facebook and Adwords PPC ads, but a lot of our business comes organically - SEO, referrals, and word of mouth. I work with a company called Godot Media to help create blogs for our website but also work to get backlinks and listings on directories to help bump us up on Google. Godot Media is a company in India that provides different “levels” of content for a pretty decent price. I provide the topics, send it over, and each month I get two 1500 word blogs for about $60. Honestly, the quality isn’t the greatest at the lowest level, which I pay for, but it gets a lot of the work out of the way. I simply go back through, change some words around to fit the southern Virginia tone, and publish. For companies with a lower budget, I definitely recommend doing it how I’ve done it.  We also have a “customer packet” that we share with each of our customers that includes the condition report, referral cards, a list of our other services, and then a postcard where we ask for a review on Facebook, Google, or Yelp.   We’ve also recently hired a door to door salesman, Kyle, who goes through neighborhoods in our market, knocking on doors and leaving newer door hangers. We’ve also implemented a sales cadence that allows for us to consistently reach out to our prospects in a more organized manner. It utilizes a mix of door hangers and mailers, plus targeting homes located in the area with PPC ads to try to boost brand awareness and hopefully taking advantage of the Rule of Seven, which basically says that prospects need to come across your brand at least seven times before they really notice it and start to take action. I’ve heard it’s sometimes up to 12 times, but seven is a good place to start.   Finally, another huge tactic that we use is calling past clients to remind them that the NFPA recommends their chimney be inspected annually by a CSIA trained professional. We also make sure to call all open quotes within 2 days of submitting the proposal and again 2 days after that to try and win the deal. This has helped increase our close rate for open quotes and helped contribute to a strong return rate for our past customers.  ‍"," You can check out our website here.

175,patron-ai," I am a 28 years old product manager who has a 6+ years software engineering background. I am based in Turkey. I work as a technical product manager in a startup. Also, I am sharing product management stories in my blog.  I went through an entrepreneurship journey between 2018-2020. Our product was patron.ai. Initially, it was a task management system with some project planning utilizers then pivoted to a gamification platform for developer teams. I was Co-Founder & Lead Developer. We had to shut down the project due to a lack of product-market fit. "," We lost all users in 4 weeks. It was a devastating situation. We have talked with users about why they signed up and why they left the product. Most of them mentioned they liked the product but it's very costly for them to migrate. Also, our value proposition was not outstanding so they had some doubts about the value as well. We decided to pivot. Patron.ai was not a project management system anymore, we were going to make it a gamification platform integrated with current project management tools. We aimed to increase productivity in businesses by gamification. We set some features to develop. We made the integration with Jira. We re-activated the website. ‍ We couldn't get enough traction. I applied some marketing tactics to drive traffic to the website. I showed activity on Reddit, Twitter. We got the traffic but still very low retention. We listen to people, do some changes, fix bugs but no tangible outcome. We entered a process called the Product Death Cycle. This process makes you focus on what they want instead of what they need. So it leads to frustration. Pivot was a very early decision. Pivot means a new hypothesis for a fundamental change. And these hypotheses should be based on analytics & data. We should pay more attention to measurements of conversion funnels and user journey maps.  To sum up we could do better if we had: Strong User-Stories (Independent, testable, small)Strong Funnel DesignProper Conversion Measurement Tools ‍",,,,," It took 8 months to publish v1.0. We were 2 people. Onur Aslan and I. Onur was developing the frontend and I was developing the backend. I was managing the relations with 3rd parties as well.  We have used VueJS in the frontend and Flask-Python in the backend. We have used Firebase and Google Analytics as well.  Maybe the biggest challenge was defining feature sets. It was difficult because we didn’t have clear user stories. So we implemented some features based on our guesses.  When we launched we didn’t have a proper launch strategy. We just announced it on Linkedin and Twitter. We got really good engagement on these platforms. Then someone listed us on Product Hunt and the product was shared in some email lists. We got 600 signups in a few days. It was very exciting. We couldn’t sleep during the night.  In terms of pricing strategy, we wanted to make it free for up to 10 users. After that, we would charge 3 to 5 dollars per month per user. We just wanted people to use and give feedback so we removed the price tag."," We didn’t have a strong marketing strategy. Both co-founders were coming from technical backgrounds. So we didn’t realize that marketing is the most important part. We had a mindset like “We will make it and they will come”. They did come actually but nobody was retained :)   But we did some campaigns through Reddit, Linkedin, and Twitter to draw more traffic. I created some funny posts for developers and designers and shared them in subreddits. We kept posting updates about our project on Twitter and Linkedin. It somehow worked, we got some traffic but retention was low, unfortunately. ‍"," My background is Back-End & Embedded Software Engineering. While I was working in a company as an embedded software engineer, I met with Asana and I didn’t find it sufficient. My idea was that current tools at that time were not able to help with project management. They just allow you to keep some records, nothing more. So I decided to make a project management tool that could report useful information to project managers, especially in project planning.  For example, if there is a new task to assign, this project should suggest which team member is the best fit in terms of time and skill set.

176,pear-cards," Hello! First, I want to thank you for reaching out about this interview. As far as my background, it’s quite eclectic. I’ve worked in everything from the film industry, hospitality, bars & restaurants, tech sales, events, marketing, and now starting up my own company with some friends! At the end of the day, I like to do something that challenges me, allows me to let my creative juices flow and puts me in a position where I can learn by doing. I am currently working on PEAR (Positive Engagement And Response) a company that is focused on giving a safe space for people to confidently come and share their thoughts and experiences. Our first product, PEAR Cards, is a card-based tool/activity that initiates positive & open communication in a non-intimidating way. Some have gone as far as calling it Cards FOR Humanity, which is quite the compliment. It started with some hand-written cards for people to respond to around a dinner table and BBQ’s and has turned into thousands of units that are now manufactured on high quality linen cardstock (the exact same cardstock as Exploding Kittens) and in places like High School classrooms, therapists & psychologists offices and on coffee tables in homes around the world!  ",," It’s hard to say we haven’t had challenges, because obviously not everything goes as planned, but for the most part we’ve been extremely fortunate and lucky thus far (knock on wood!) It’s been interesting trying to bootstrap this while not really working a full-time job, but it allows us plenty of time to focus on our company, and that’s extremely valuable. One thing I can say is it has definitely changed our personal lives, but I don’t find it to be negatively impacting us. I spend more time working on this now instead of being with family & friends, but I also think that is apart of chasing something you’re passionate about. I just need to remind myself more often than before to create time to see my parents and friends that aren’t in my general vicinity. It’s easy to get obsessive over things and not be able to let it go. This also goes with a saying a mentor of mine, Lain Henlsey, mentioned - “It’s not about perfection, it’s about connection.” I also like to think about the idea that getting something done is sometimes better than making something perfect. A lot of times we get caught up on being perfect, and that stops us from just getting it done in the first place. ‍  Again, there isn’t really a massive mistake that comes to mind. We also live with the mantra that there isn’t a mistake of failure as long as you’re learning from it. So, on that note, I will say, international shipping is extremely expensive, haha! Due to this realization, we’ve decided that for the foreseeable future, we will only be available in the United States - post Kickstarter. During the Kickstarter, we were available internationally, and after looking at shipping costs, it doesn’t make much sense. I wish we would have figured this out earlier, or made that decision before the Kickstarter, but for the few international backers, they will have a one-of-a-kind product for a little while, so hopefully, they enjoy using a rare item in their country until we decide to ship international again! It’s also interesting dealing with logistics and fulfillment on our own. We wanted to give it a try, but I would be lying if I said packaging 300+ units from a small bedroom wasn’t a bit draining. We hope to one day be able to give our business to a fulfillment team, that way we can focus on growing PEAR into the future as the company we imagine it can become.",,," We don’t necessarily have a breakdown of “job descriptions” for each person. We all sort of attack things together, and eventually we will need to create an outline of who works on what. We also have semi-similar backgrounds, so we don’t have anyone that is an expert in a specific facet of business, and I’d like this to change going forward as well. But, with that said, I find it exciting that it gives us more opportunity to learn and grow as individuals and a team. We can find that niche we are passionate about and take it on to help ourselves and the business. Recently, we’ve also had people reach out to us and let us know that there are similar products out there. Although to me, this almost seems to validate PEAR Cards, because something in the same realm has been done and made an impact. What I like to do is look into why THEY aren’t at the level of success that I hope PEAR and PEAR Cards can get to. I find that more interesting and beneficial than looking back at what I wish we could change, how we would do things differently, etc. I want to see why these other products have found some success but haven’t completely captured the market. ‍"," After having an amazing experience using the hand-written prompts that my Co-Founder Nathan Anderson’s mom created for a buddie’s college graduation party, we decided this was something that needed to be shared with others around the world. The next day we were brainstorming over multiple glasses of wine at a local bar & restaurant. We wanted to write down as many prompts & questions as possible, without losing out on quality content. Once this was done, we ordered an original prototype. I created them on a website where you can design custom cards. I think the set was around $50 and was 108, circular cards, with our questions and prompts on them. We used these for a few weeks, and then decided to rework some of the content. After this, we reached out to our graphic designer who had created our logo, Kevin, who I found through Reddit. I had him whip up a much higher quality set that we then sent over to Print Play Games for a few REAL prototypes, with a box & all in order to send out to some of our beneficiaries (we will be donating 10% of our PEAR Card profits to Mental Health America, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and Brain & Behavior Research Foundation), some of our social media influencers & other who’d helped us up to this point. Print Play Games is the prototype division of AdMagic, an indie game printer who’ve done games like Cards Against Humanity and Exploding Kittens. I found them online and they have been nothing short of amazing. Once we finalized everything, we went to Kickstarter and raised a little over $19,000 and got our first shipment of PEAR Cards created!  ",,," I wouldn’t have changed the way we did things, because we learned through it all and had a fantastic time, but I do wish our Kickstarter would have gained more buzz. This could have been done by putting more effort, time, or money into marketing our campaign a little better. Making things cleaner, more understandable, or maybe creating a nicer video, etc. We wanted Kickstarter to be our biggest marketing campaign up to date, and although it still may be the case, I was really hoping it would have taken off. We imagined being selected as a “Project We Love” or “Trending” and neither of these happened. It is what it is, but who doesn’t want to wake up one day to see your Kickstarter on the internet and an email from The Ellen Show asking for an appearance, haha! ‍"," Nathan and I had just gotten back from traveling Europe for 10 weeks and at that time I hadn’t received a paycheck in almost 8 months when PEAR became a reality, so our marketing then (and still to this day) is primarily through social media & word of mouth. We use Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to reach out to people and share as much information as possible. We will be focusing a lot more on this in the coming months, seeing as we have a website and product to sell now. We’ve been lucky to have local press reach out to us and have even given some talks and workshops in front of people which is great for marketing your business and product as well. The Kickstarter was great as well, but nothing “viral” or close to it. I think about 5% of our purchases on the Kickstarter were organically through the website itself, so it definitely helped, but it wasn’t what I had hoped for, unfortunately."," Our website has our blog and links to social media on there. Our blogs are currently written by myself, Nathan, Benjamin White (who is also apart of PEAR) and a friend Steve Rector. We are always looking for more contributors who have a story or experience that they’d like to share - so please reach out if you’re interested in sharing! We are @passthepear on all social media accounts and can be reached at contact@pearcards.com!"," To be honest, I learned the best from the most amazing tools we have. Our connections & relationships with real people. There is an abundant amount of people in this world that are willing to help and are available. I reached out to family and friends who’ve been successful and picked their brain. I also reached out to acquaintances and strangers, who were all extremely helpful as well. They have the experience and genuine caring mentality to make sure you’re set up for success. I also gained a lot of information from a few subreddits that were extremely valuable. You have to wade through some gravel, but there is absolute gold in there, and people who have amazing advice and experiences to share. After those two, nothing is better than the reliable Google. There’s so much information on the internet, if Google can’t find it, it might not exist.  ",,Productivity,,United States,"February 21, 2019",Matthew Roberts,https://www.failory.com/interview/pear-cards,"['http://www.pearcards.com/', 'mailto:contact@pearcards.com']",success,1,No Data,"PEAR Cards is a card-based tool that initiates positive & open communication in a non-intimidating way.

177,phez," Hello. I’m a 38-year-old software developer and entrepreneur based in Portland, Oregon. Phez (formerly located at phez.co) was a Reddit alternative that I launched in the summer of 2015. The concept of Phez was to reward content submitters in Bitcoin and had an emphasis on free speech. I was the sole creator of Phez, and honestly, this isn’t an utterly remarkable story where we blew through $17 million in VC funding and ended up crashing and burning or anything exciting like that. It’s just an honest take on what happened when a side project fails. The business model was going to be very similar to Reddit, with the exception that we would also reward the top contributors in Bitcoin payments. So, the idea was that we would eventually build a big enough audience to run ads, sell in-house ads, offer premium subscriptions (e.g. phez gold, etc.). ‍"," The main cause of Phez’s failure was a poor business model. It was self-funded, with about $350 or so worth of Bitcoin (to be paid out to the top contributors each month), and some more funds used for Amazon AWS. The first month -- I know people were curious as to whether it was a scam or not. But then the payments actually went out. So, people knew they could make at least, say, $10 to $25 or so in Bitcoin, if they were one of the top contributors. The payout structure was like a pyramid where the top user might get $25 or so, and then the other $100 or whatever was split between the rest of the top, say, 15 contributors. I kept improving Phez over the course of several months, but traffic was not increasing. SPAM and attempts to game the system were a major issue, as one could imagine. I knew they would be, of course. But every few weeks, it seemed like someone would come up with a new way to post gibberish comments/posts, in an attempt to boost their karma rankings. There was hardly any traffic on the site, so I monitored everything pretty closely. It was very easy to shut these attempts down, but it was still annoying nonetheless. I made sure to announce ahead of time that Phez would be closing so that people would know on the 1st of the next month, users would no longer be getting rewarded for posting content, and the site would be shuttered shortly thereafter. It was actually a relief to shut it down. It wasn’t fun for me to work on it anymore. ‍"," The biggest mistake was probably just that it was a flawed concept, to begin with. Something like Steemit seems much more viable. But they have an actual cryptocurrency that backs their social media platform. I believe they have a whole team of developers. I’m just a web programming guy. It would take me years to get over the learning curve to build a cryptocurrency in C++, and I just have no desire, either. Phez was a very poor man’s Reddit. There was NO competitive advantage, other than the idea of getting rewarded for your content in Bitcoin. Sure, we had the concept of “free speech platform,” but there was already Voat, and that has just turned into a toxic echo-chamber itself. (That seems to be what happens when major social media platforms limit free speech. A certain kind of speech gets shuffled over to its own echo chamber, where it stews. I don’t think that’s the healthiest approach to speech on the Internet, but that’s just my opinion.) One big mistake was rewarding users in cryptocurrency (say, instead of just USD) in the year 2015 when it would happen to rise meteorically over the next few years. Hindsight is always 20/20, though. ‍",,,," I’ve been developing Ruby on Rails web applications since shortly after DHH released the framework, some 10+ years ago now. So, I knew that I would use RoR. To launch, I just wanted the MVP set of features for a Reddit clone: posts, communities of interest, voting, commenting, etc. I was the primary developer throughout the entirety of Phez’s brief lifespan (a few other contributors submitted patches). I use Sublime Text for an editor, and my typical deployment stack is: Amazon AWS, Ubuntu Linux, Ruby on Rails (latest at the time), PostgreSQL, nginx, and unicorn. The initial product looked terrible! Just like a boilerplate Bootstrap site, that was very obviously a Reddit clone, functionality-wise. One of the biggest obstacles I faced was responsive HTML/CSS development (getting the same HTML to look decent on desktops and mobile devices). As a backend developer, who also deploys/manages applications (e.g. some DevOps), you have to know pretty much already. Then throw in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, etc. on top of that -- and you are looking at pretty many technologies, and it’s hard to master them all. So, I pride myself on being a jack-of-all-trades, but yes, perhaps, master of only a few. Publicity is an area that I’ve never had a knack for, honestly. I basically just find a few subreddits that might appreciate it and launch my projects on there. Maybe a handful of other social networks, but I never do much promotion otherwise, typically. That was the case with Phez. ‍",," ‍ I’m a big believer in free speech. Reddit has had its issues with silencing certain communities over the years. It’s a private company that’s their right. But I believe there should be somewhere online where you can voice opinions that are outside of the Overton window. My background is in web programming -- primarily backend development, but I know enough front-end to cobble together an okay-ish Bootstrap-powered site. Phez was just a side project for me. I built the initial prototype over a few long weekends, then continued to iterate on it over several months. I’ve been doing freelance Ruby on Rails development for the last five or six years. Phez definitely wasn’t my first rodeo in the side project game. I have literally lost track of how many little side projects I have created over the years. That may be indicative of a problem area for me -- that I don’t give an idea enough time to flourish. It’s very hard to tell when one should “put down” one of their darlings and move on to potentially greener pastures. (In hindsight, something similar to Phez has actually done fairly well in the marketplace, by many accounts: Steemit. It is a social network backed by its own cryptocurrency. It’s a great idea, but much more ambitious than what I had in mind with Phez.) ‍"," If I could go back in time, I’d tell myself to wait and pick a better idea than doing a Reddit clone with Bitcoin rewards. (Also, it’s a silly name!) I tried reaching out to Ruby on Rails developers who were potentially interested in helping out with Phez development. The idea was that it could power other sites than just the one at phez.co. This ended up being a waste of time. A few guys were interested, but they just ended up kicking the tires and didn’t contribute all that much in the end. If I could do it all over again, of course, I’d just reward users with USD instead of Bitcoin. But the idea that it was Bitcoin (as opposed to just USD) was a pretty core part of the concept. I believe there were already other content networks where you could get micropayments (in USD) for your content. I suppose I should have spent more time trying to market the site. It’s just not my strong suit. I built an entire API for Phez because I had big dreams of a mobile app one day. I don’t think the API had even one single user, ever! Overall, I just invested too much time in this failed experiment. That’s what I regret most actually (the opportunity cost of my time), even more so than paying out some Bitcoins before they rose in price dramatically. ‍"," I guess that was the problem, I didn’t have one or any. I was hoping for some -- any -- kind of natural, viral growth. But it just didn’t happen. It was hard to get even one single user to contribute anything that wasn’t the most bottom-tier, effortless kind of post. It seemed like 99% of posts/comments were made with just the idea of doing the bare minimum to receive a Bitcoin micropayment. I believe there was a problem with the model altogether -- that when you suddenly introduce money into the equation (and it’s, say, nickels or dimes in Bitcoin equivalent, in this situation), people may feel even less likely to contribute. That is, then if they were just receiving imaginary Internet karma points. (Even though Phez had the notion of karma, too.) One thing I’ve noticed over the years is that dominant social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have pushed out many of the smaller sites, where one used to be able to find content. Back in the day, one could email a handful of bloggers and get the word out about a new project. It’s much more difficult to do that today."," I’m in the process of launching a new project, called Timewalk Ventures. We’re trying to do something similar to Y Combinator, but for smaller side projects. Moreover, make sure you check out my Twitter!"," Y Combinator’s Hacker News, of course. It’s actually been a while since I’ve done a lot of entrepreneurial reading. I was a major reader of all kinds of business books back in the day, and just got kind of burned out on them. One good one that comes to mind is “The E-Myth”, and there’s an updated version as well. The gist of it can be boiled down to this: let’s say you sell widgets. You think you are in the business of creating and selling widgets. But what you’re actually doing (if you want to be successful) is creating a system or business process that allows you to create and sell those widgets. That’s where the real value is--the system--not in creating the best or cheapest widget. It’s not an earth-shattering concept by any means, just something to keep in mind for business owners who are just starting out. For me, I love creating automated websites that can eventually just bring in cash each month with minimal effort. ‍"," On July 15th, 2015, one Bitcoin was worth approximately $260 USD. Of course, the price fluctuated throughout the several months that Phez was live. But let’s use this rough amount as an estimate for the value of one BTC back then. I would estimate that we paid out somewhere between 1 and 2 BTC (I don’t remember the exact figures). Let’s assume it was 1.5 bitcoins so we can do some calculations. At the time, that was only $390 USD. Not a huge investment, if you think about it. I was willing to throw that amount away if I had to, to get the site going. What I didn’t know--what was hard to predict back then--was that the price of Bitcoin would rise meteorically over the coming years. Let’s assume I was actually a master market predictor and could have timed the market perfectly, and cashed out this entire amount of BTC at its last peak (at the time of this writing) at $19,343 on December 16th, 2017. $19,343 * 1.5 BTC = $29,014.50 (!!!)  Wow, do I feel stupid now. ‍ Amazon AWS hosting costs were minimal -- probably $20 per month or so. The most important thing I lost was the opportunity cost of my time. I poured at least 100 hours into Phez development.

I got the motivation behind this one day I was thinking about death, and I thought: ""One of the saddest things about death is that when you leave, you leave your ideas as well, your vision and the things you always wanted to say and do"". Then I thought of a way to send whatever you want to the people you care about :) I know what you are thinking, how the hell is Phoenix going to know when am I going to die? Well, pretty simple, there was a section in the app that acted like a button (I called it the Check-In) in there you just had to click on it to let Phoenix know you are still alive! If you don't press it after a year, Phoenix will suppose you're dead, and will send the letters! ‍"," Woah! A lot! First of all is to start super simple (KISS - Keep it simple stupid).

179,photobooth-supply," I’m Brandon Wong, CEO and founder of Photobooth Supply Co. We provide a business opportunity in the form of a photobooth, which allows you to record memories while earning a substantial profit. The event sector is flourishing in this experience economy, and photo booths are the fastest-growing segment. Between 2005 and 2012, more individuals looked for photo booth rentals on the internet than wedding DJs.  And we don't only capture gorgeous images we also make videos, boomerangs, GIFs, and more. This is easily shareable on social media. The fact that we've changed the lives of over 1,000 individuals is the most significant aspect of what we do. For me, it's not about the money it's about the fact that the firm my wife and I founded has provided so many excellent possibilities for individuals to reach their full potential while having a great time doing so. ‍",,,," We are generating six figures in revenue per month. The post-support questionnaires we send out have a 97 percent customer satisfaction rating. All of this is the result of our focus on the customer experience. My biggest concern was that booths would be only a trend, but it isn't the case. Since its start, our startup has grown every year. This growth came not only from private parties but from retail establishments, restaurants, nightclubs, and any other place where people congregate. The future seems promising. We haven’t been sitting around doing anything in fact, we've already begun beta testing on a new product for an entirely new segment. ‍",," Our photography business was not scalable, and we struck a revenue ceiling that was difficult to overcome. The only way to get around this was to create more services. This is, of course, where the photobooth came into play. Dieter Rams, the great product designer, was a significant inspiration. We started with the booth's required electronics (computer, touch screen, camera, flash, printer, etc.). We designed a product that was the most beautiful embodiment of those components: nothing more and nothing else. We ran a fast Google search for a nearby fabricator to make our first alpha device. We completed a couple of quick prototypes in the three weeks coming up to our first trade exhibition. We began as simply as possible and progressed from there. These rapid iterations helped us go to market faster and allowed us to do numerous rounds of UX testing, resulting in a better product. We started using Squarespace to develop the website, which is by far the easiest, cheapest, and most attractive web design option I've ever tried. After two years of using it, we moved to Shopify due to its extensions and powerful backend.",," My wife and I used to shoot weddings. You've undoubtedly seen a photobooth if you've recently attended a wedding. Many years ago, we noticed booths all over the place and thought to ourselves, ""Why not get one of those?"" We purchased the ""old"" type photobooth. It became evident that it wasn't very portable, and the photographs weren't beautiful. I reached out to a couple of metal vendors in Orange County, asking if they could put anything together for me. I needed something slim and portable, but it had to be able to shoot beautiful photos as well. My wife and I worked for weeks on getting the images right, and we created a few interesting-looking prototypes in the meantime. Our friends immediately approached us, asking if we could put something together for them as well. So we secured a place at the world's largest wedding photography show which was set to take place in three weeks. We built a website, branding, promotional videos, a trade show exhibit, a prototype unit, a sales pitch, pricing, and everything else in that time frame. We sold over ten booths at the exhibition and quadrupled that amount the following week. We manually delivered one of the booths to a customer in Vegas a month later, and I used the money to purchase an engagement ring. Six months later, we were married. After that tradeshow, we just kept putting in the effort to offer additional resources and value to assist our clients in generating more money: marketing materials, sample contracts, training videos, instructional webinars, and other resources. We went from selling photo booths to selling a complete business opportunity in a short period, all without any franchise fees or the requirement for an initial financial commitment."," I'm a firm believer in saying yes and figuring it out later. Stop overthinking and start acting. The more you allow things to slow you down, the more things will be able to slow you down. It's alright to be irrational sometimes! You must establish a routine. You'll most likely be working from home. Building a habit for yourself might help you become more productive. Segmenting your web browsers is a smart idea. For business, use Chrome, while for personal stuff, use Firefox. It saves you a lot of time and prevents you from spending your time on Reddit rather than working! It's also tough to expand your business without first figuring out what it's missing. To do so, you must first recognize your strengths and weaknesses. ‍"," We had two primary sales channels. We participate in tradeshows to get clients, and we have a strong SEO presence. A tradeshow is like having instant access to hundreds or thousands of hot leads while every rival is standing right next to you. It's harsh, draining, and amazing all at the same time. As a product, you must stand out. We could spend $10,000 on a location and another $10,000 on staff and set up supplies. The margins become much tighter, but if you choose good shows, the kinds that your current consumers enjoy, you'll do well. The best tradeshow-selection tip I can give is to simply ask your clients where they'll be and go there. Partly to sell, and partially to meet your customers face to face. You can never devote enough time to learning about your clients. Learning how to serve others with what you do is the most valuable time you can spend on your business. SEO is a complicated world to understand. I recommend hiring the best person you can and allowing them to focus on their strengths. Sometimes this entails bringing the service in-house, and other times you need an outside agency. The ROI here is huge for us. It all comes back to what I stated before about choosing the tradeshow where your clients would be. Choose the communication channel that your clients prefer."," You can check our website, our Instagram, and our Twitter."," We use Shopify to host our online store, Zendesk for customer service, and HubSpot for CRM. Make use of the best tools available. It's never worth putting your entire company on hold to save $10 or $20 a month on a worse platform. We cut whatever we aren't using. As soon as Instagram added scheduling options, we broke up with Later. We recently discontinued our VOIP platform in favor of HubSpot's recorded calls, which were much smoother. We now have over 15 team members who work from home. Fortunately, we use platforms like Slack, Flow, Google Hangouts, and Google Drive to keep communication and tasks transparent across the company, even though we aren't physically next to each other. I recommend 3 books for entrepreneurs: How to Win Friends and Influence People - For sales, fundraising, attracting influencers, and being an all-around badass. Zero To One - To encourage you to think bigger. Simply by forcing you to think from a different perspective, this book has the potential to double the size of your business tenfold.

I am the creator of Photopea, which is an advanced photo editor. I am the only person working on Photopea, and I do “everything” :) ‍",," I often struggled a lot when making some new Photopea features. There are things on which I spent a lot of time without success, so I gave up, and that time did not contribute to Photopea in any way. I am not aware of any serious mistakes. Maybe Photopea could be much more advanced, popular, or profitable if I did something differently, but it is hard to tell. I am afraid of getting a business partner or an investor. I would feel quite uncomfortable having one. I am aware that this “fear” is not rational, and I could miss many opportunities. ‍",," Photopea.com is opened 10 million times a month. People spend 1.5 million hours a month using Photopea. The ads allow me to make around 6 cents for each hour someone spends on Photopea.com so that I can make about $100,000 a month from ads. My web hosting costs $50 a year (there is no server-side code, it is just a file hosting for a couple of JavaScript files). The Photopea.com domain costs $16 a year. I have been cooperating with several programmers in the last two years. I would like to build a team that would “do everything” without me, but I am still far from that. In the future, I still want to add new features to Photopea and improve the current features. I had an idea of making a video editor or an advanced editor of vector graphics. I know I could do all that myself, but it all takes years to make. My personal goal is to do ten muscle-ups in a row I can do one now :)",," I just took my laptop and started to code. I was not making or counting on any money I did it for fun. I did not analyze any market, or “validate” any business ideas. On the other hand, I was absolutely sure that if you make a replacement for a popular commercial product, people will come sticking millions into your pocket, whether you want it or not. And I was sure I could create pretty much any software I wanted. But I was not sure if I wanted to invest a part of my life into making such a product.  It all happened naturally, by finishing one feature after another, helping one user after another, without knowing what would come next or what was my goal.",," I started a bachelor’s degree in computer science in 2009. I have always been a fan of the web, and I was making some experiments, games, etc. I monetized my games with ads and that was my primary source of income while studying ($100 - $400 a month). In 2012, I had an idea to make a website for displaying PSD files. I wanted to show a list of layers and allow the user to hide/unhide some of them. The first version (PSD viewer) was released in 2013. Gradually (after thousands of hours of work), it turned into a full graphics editor. I was still studying, so Photopea was my free time activity. I finished my master’s degree in 2017 and I have been working only on Photopea since then. ‍"," Do not sell your work if someone offers you 10x, 100x, or even 1000x more money than you have made in your life so far. Unless you clearly know what you would like to do with that money. Do not be afraid to try new things. If you do what you enjoy, you can be 10x more productive than if you did what you don’t enjoy. Do not let others tell you what a good or a bad idea is, especially when you have thought about it for days/weeks/months while they have thought about it for half a minute. You never know until you try it. ‍"," I used to “spam” about Photopea all over the internet. I wrote a comment about Photopea under each article about Photoshop alternatives. I posted on Reddit, Hacker News, etc. 90% of my posts and comments were marked as self-promotion and deleted. Also, I begged random YouTubers to review Photopea, 90% of them ignored me, and 10% asked for money (which I did not have back then). But various people reviewed Photopea “spontaneously” (without being in touch with me), and such articles and videos drew more attention to Photopea over the last 8 years. I used to monetize my games with ads since 2006, so it was a “well-known” monetization strategy. That is how Google, Facebook, and others generate the majority of their income.

181,plausible," I’m Marko Saric and I’m the co-founder of Plausible Analytics. Plausible Analytics is a simple, open-source, lightweight (< 1 KB) and privacy-friendly web analytics alternative to Google Analytics. It’s the two of us in the Plausible team. We’re working remotely and flexibly. We’re based in the EU and we are a completely independent, self-funded, and bootstrapped startup. My responsibilities are in the marketing and communication side of things. I take care of the blog content, social media, community engagement, customer support, and things like that. Our business model is based on subscriptions. We’re a privacy-first startup and have nothing to do with surveillance capitalism and the monetization of personal data. Instead of giving our services away for free in exchange for the collection and monetization of data for advertising purposes, we charge a subscription fee. We do have a free trial and if you’d like to continue using our product the subscription plans start at $4/month. ‍",,,," Our revenue has grown a lot too since that blog post went “viral”. As I’m writing this on September 3rd, we’re on $4,105 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and we have 657 paying subscribers.  Plausible is installed on 3,638 websites and we've counted 59,351,293 pageviews in the last month. That's 60 million pageviews fewer going to surveillance capitalism! It’s still only the two of us and the short-term goal is to continue with what we’ve been doing over the last few months as it’s working. Then we will see where that takes us. We’re bootstrapped and self-funded so we do not just plan to go and hire a big team or change our structure or start spending a lot of money on paid advertising and such. Our focus is on sustainability and on growing responsibly. We’re an open-source project with a free as in beer self-hosted product too so we have a great community of people interested in what we’re doing. People are sending in their feedback and feature requests, people are building Plausible integrations with their favorite CMS and other website tools, and people are helping us improve the product too. It’s great to be a part of this project and hopefully, we can keep growing and keep removing surveillance tools from the adtech industry from even more websites and from an even larger part of the web. ‍",," Uku built and designed the product on his own in the period of a couple of months in early 2019. Everything was done in the open as he shared his thought process on the blog and he interacted and engaged with the different communities such as Indie Hackers. We open-sourced the product, opened the development process, asked for public feedback and feature requests, and made the product roadmap open to the public too. There was no big launch and the product grew organically from the community engagement.  The pricing structure was kept very simple and as straightforward as possible. There are no premium features, accounts are billed purely for the amount of traffic they get and we keep the prices as affordable as possible in order to make it possible for even the small sites to be able to get a privacy friendly analytics product. Google has taught people that the price of web analytics (and any other product) should be free and that you should be the product instead of paying with your privacy and your data and the data of your customers and we’re trying to change that.",," My professional background is in marketing. I have a bachelor in marketing management and have worked in digital marketing from the start of my career. I've worked for large public-listed companies and small venture-funded startups in areas such as affiliate marketing, social media marketing, and content marketing.  My co-founder Uku started Plausible last year and I joined earlier this year. Our story and experience with Google and its products is similar. A few years ago, I was a big fan, using several of their tools for many hours every day, loving them and recommending them to my family and friends. Over the last couple of years, I’ve become more aware of Google’s size, its business model, and how their dominance negatively impacts the web that I love. I started looking more into better and more ethical alternative tools, I started blogging about them on my site and that’s how Uku found me and got in touch. The idea with Plausible Analytics is to provide an independent web analytics tool that’s built around respect and privacy. We aim to strike the balance between giving some useful information to the website owner so they understand what their efforts result in but at the same time comply with all the privacy regulations and not be intrusive and invasive in terms of visitor’s privacy. We’ve built Plausible to be as privacy friendly as it can be. We don’t use any cookies, we don’t collect any personal data such as IP addresses, we don’t have any persistent identifiers, we don’t track people between their devices and between the different sites and/or apps they use, and so on. ‍"," It’s been an amazing 6 months or so since I joined. We’ve done a lot, grown a lot, and made a lot of progress. And we haven’t done any tricks or any hacks to do so. Many times marketing people feel like they’re forced to sell stuff to people that people don’t want and don’t need. And this is completely the opposite.  We’ve spread the word about Plausible and what makes us different from Google Analytics and a decent percentage of people that hear about us connect to that message as it resonates with them and they try out the product and hopefully end up liking it enough that they choose to permanently remove Google Analytics. So the lesson is basically to always start by creating a great product that people enjoy. Without a great product, the marketing, and the growth job becomes so much more difficult and that’s when you get into situations where you need to use hacks and tricks to get some people to sign up as they don’t volunteer to do so of their own free will.  We’re still very early in this process and things have been going so well that it’s too early to zoom out and think about what mistakes we’ve made, what we could have done better or differently, or what we should change.  In general, the big challenge is that Google and the adtech are an ingrained part of the web and how websites are made these days. Pretty much every website has at least one connection to Google and its tools, or to Facebook and other adtech companies. And their tools are all given away to website owners for free. So we are working against the current norm of the web, against free and against the tech giants and that whole cultural and structural thing takes a bit of time to change. ‍"," Our marketing is a bit different and a bit unconventional compared to the normal way of doing things in the startup world. We say no to most of the best marketing practices. We don’t do any paid advertising, we don’t use pixels and other tracking to do retargeting around the web, we don’t do any experiments on our website visitors, we don’t have an affiliate program and we don’t pay anyone to promote or recommend Plausible.   What we focus on is content marketing and community engagement. We write and publish regular posts on our blog and we engage on different social media platforms and niche community sites. I joined Uku in the middle of March this year and I published my first blog post on April 8th with the headline of Why you should stop using Google Analytics on your website. Since then we’ve pretty much published one blog post per week or so. Our posts are not salesy. They are longer pieces and well-researched pieces on the different topics that are relevant to our product and our audience. We always start with the audience in mind. What questions do they have? What issues are they trying to solve? And we create content trying to do just that. We got traction immediately as the first post I published did great on communities such as Hacker News and it got a lot of attention. That first post has been read by about 65,000 people until now. You can see here our website traffic since I started. We actually have all of our website stats open to the public so you can take a look at our live demo here and explore and dig deeper. ‍"," You can take a look at our product and get a free trial here. We have two official social media profiles that we are active on and you can follow there for the latest updates, latest stats, and other news. Here’s our Twitter and Mastodon."," About tools: We try to use open source software as much as possible and we keep things as simple as possible by not using too many tools when it’s not necessary. We also try to support independent companies and projects whenever possible. Plausible Analytics is a standard Elixir/Phoenix application backed by a PostgreSQL database for general data and a Clickhouse database for stats.  On the frontend, we use TailwindCSS for styling and React to make the dashboard interactive. We use Netlify CMS for our blog. We use Paddle as our payment processor as they take care of VAT and sales taxes for us. Our internal chat communication tool is Element. We use GitHub for our feature requests, development, and product roadmap. We use Fastmail for email. About books: My favorite startup book is Rework by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson from Basecamp. I love their philosophy and the way they view startups, growth, business, and life in general.  Most of the lessons they share in the book are very unconventional and completely opposite of what you see and read in your average business or startup or marketing book. It has helped me have the right mindset needed to do well at startups. It has helped me be more comfortable about looking at common advice critically, judging it, and being happy to say no to most of things.  You don’t really need to follow all the best practices and do all the things every book or blog post recommends. Do what you feel is right for your situation and focus on a few selected things that you believe can make a difference for your startup.  These few things then you can try to become very good at instead of spreading yourself too thin trying to tick all the boxes that the books and famous startup founders recommend. ‍",,Software & Hardware,,Remote,"October 26, 2020",Marko Saric,https://www.failory.com/interview/plausible,"['https://plausible.io/', 'https://twitter.com/plausiblehq', 'https://fosstodon.org/@plausible']",success,1,$0-$10k/mo,"Marko and Uku are the co-founders of Plausible, a privacy-friendly and open-source alternative to Google Analytics.

182,playdate," Hey there, my name’s Logan. I’m 28 and I’m an engineer in San Francisco. My majors were in applied math and behavioral economics, beginning my career in finance in 2014 and transitioning into software engineering in 2015. I’ve successfully failed 3 companies so far, and I’m most passionate about making life happier and better for others. I’m currently one of the founding engineers at a small startup called Retain.ai, helping companies understand how they spend their time. If you are a designer or full-stack or frontend engineer looking for a fun startup environment with no politics and tons of learning and mentorship, email me at logan@retain.ai! As far as side projects go, I’m currently working on a mobile trivia game app for the TV show Friends called Bamboozled, which is in development. I’m hoping to deploy to the App Store and Play Store by the end of 2019. My most recent entrepreneurial pursuit was being CEO and CTO of Playdate for 2 years. I alone grew our user base to 300+ users and social media accounts to over 300+ hundred followers over a month, before growing the team to 7 at its peak and about 5k MAU (monthly active users). Playdate was an on-demand social networking app. Our users could pick an activity and at a tap of a button be instantly matched with another person. The idea was that we could use science to minimize “time to meeting” for people looking for short term or long term friendship. The app was free with no premium features or ads, and we aimed to make money by offering coupons from nearby venues that were only revealed upon physically meeting for a playdate. ‍"," At the end of the day, Playdate failed because we ran out of money, like all failed companies. The causes were, however, distinctly ours. First, we chose cannabis consumption as our first vertical for reasons outlined above. But this was a mistake. Our stoner user base turned out to not be more likely to give us feedback it was actually quite the opposite. Many users didn’t feel comfortable attaching their online presence to marijuana, some were paranoid about law enforcement, and the rest were doing other high things that didn’t include giving feedback or writing emails. We offered free cannabis and free pipes to our power users in exchange for feedback, and we still didn’t hear back from a single user. Even though legalization was in full swing, the stigma was still very much there. Moreover, illegal states were tricky to navigate as they were murky legal areas. Another major problem was the “chicken and egg problem,” which we had thought we could mitigate with our matching mechanism. Although users didn’t have the chance to run out of users to swipe or see how few other users were nearby, they still ran out of compatible nearby potential playdates far too quickly. Speaking of, we couldn’t provide unlimited playdates so we only allowed three a day. This was because users would exhaust their pool of potentials too fast and we wanted to make each playdate valuable in order to encourage people to actually go on their playdates. All of this tied our hands during a time we should have been freer to explore different methods and ideas. Another thing that burned us was our organic growth. We simply didn’t grow fast enough to make a social networking app take off. If we were able to geofence app downloads more stringently (we could only do it by country), we might have been able to maintain user density. Initially, we thought we could drive growth in one location by going hard on our grassroots campaigns to give out free cannabis for app downloads. But this didn’t work because these users would not stick around, causing terrible metrics and bad matches with inactive users. Furthermore, we didn’t think to geofence the app through our API or other means, which led to random users from all over the country finding our app through our SEO and ASO methods. This would normally be a great thing except user density was more important than growth, an insight we realized too late. The final straw was when I realized we were “the walking dead” or “a zombie,” a company that wasn’t dying exactly but wasn’t growing fast enough to gain momentum or be interesting to investors. We officially ended things on February 22, 2019, after sending farewell emails to all our users."," One challenge we had was Android QA. The team was covered on iPhones and we had three Android phones. The problem was that there is such a variety of Android phones that we were constantly battling bugs that we couldn’t reproduce in simulators or on the phones we had. We were mostly unsuccessful in managing this problem but we occasionally got lucky. In one case, a user emailed us complaining that our app didn’t work for her and she was going to leave a bad review (by the way, almost all of our inbound user emails were either appreciative and helpful or mean-spirited and hurtful). The initial email was vague and emotional, honestly like 99% of the emails. I responded immediately and made sure she knew she was being heard. I connected with her a bit and as our conversation continued over days, I was able to uncover all the technical details necessary to fix all the bugs she was experiencing. While performing a root cause analysis, I also got to know her as a person. She was very appreciative, and she ended up not leaving a negative rating. This was just one of many times that I’ve been able to successfully interact with disgruntled users. Applying empathy and mindful listening to diffuse difficult situations while applying principles like the 5 Whys and the MomTest has been successful in turning detractors into advocates. Another interesting challenge with making a friendship-only app was that people genuinely did not seem to only want platonic relationships. About half of our users wanted to use the app to date new people. We could’ve banned or prevented signups from these romance-seeking users, but this would’ve meant (1) ignoring what our user base was telling us they wanted, (2) taking the time to prune our existing user base and throttling signups, (3) missing a good opportunity to learn how to achieve better product-market fit, and (4) potentially lowering the quality of our playdates by decreasing user density. On the other hand, we could’ve let them stay, but that would mean (1) compromising our values and turning Playdate into what amounted to another dating app with a twist, (2) converting from a friendship-only app to a friendship-and-relationship app likely too early (it’s easier to go from friendship to both over relationship to both, but once you make that leap it’s irreversible), and (3) making about half the playdates incompatible because one person would want just a friend while the other would want more. We ended up finding a compromise by adding a new feature called “looking for.” It was basically a user-selected flag for “strictly friends” or “maybe more.” This essentially split our user base in two but allowed us to continue to serve both types of users and gather data and feedback about both. Also, don’t hire any interns for a while. It is decidedly negative expected value. ‍",,,," I started working on Playdate as a side project in early 2016. I had assessed the options for mobile development and decided on doing it natively at first, a decision I would later regret. Swift was relatively easier to learn than Java, and I decided to supplement development with contractors. I hired a few different ones through Upwork and had modest success. As a developer myself, it was straight-forward to vet the offshore teams before starting contracts with them. As I worked on this, I realized that I could not juggle my full-time job as a developer with this side project in the timeframe I wanted. So I quit my job in August 2017 to pursue Playdate fulltime and found a cofounder in early 2018. Around April 2017, we soft-launched Playdate to the App and Play Stores. After we got initial traction, we garnered as much feedback as we could from hundreds of users to help design the next version. I ultimately decided to rewrite the codebase using React Native for the following reasons: React Native was in a much more stable place than when I had last looked into it on project inception it had garnered much more of a community and available online resources. Facebook had also changed the license from their own restrictive one to the MIT License, making its use feasible. Moreover, React Native was certainly appealing because JavaScript is my most familiar language and our designer-turned-engineer was similarly comfortable with JS. Finally, there were some “nice-to-have” features like hot reloading sims, but perhaps the most important impacts were that the overhaul provided a way to rebuild our client-side foundation to erase significant technical debt and helped build team morale with a tangible win.  Playdate was free and ad-less, and would always be that way. We planned to make money by providing coupons from venues when users had an in-person playdate, but this was to be post-MVP and after building up a user base. During the lifetime of Playdate, we focused exclusively on growing as quickly as possible. Here are some pics that show the evolution of the app: ‍  It was around this time I used a friend-of-a-friend designer to create the logo (best $20 spent ever). Lesson learned, a good designer can create logos and designs faster and better than I can. Awesome specialists are worth their weight in gold. ",," I’m strongly introverted so I know all too well the pain of being crippled by shyness and social anxiety that can make making friends incredibly daunting. I tried all the social networking apps I heard of but they simply didn’t work for making friends. Over the years, I started noticing others, even extroverts, having similar problems. As I learned about the loneliness epidemic, I realized the world needs an app that actually works, helping people easily meet others and create friendships. So I began working on this as a side project in 2016.  Using my background in psychology, I was determined to remove as many psychological barriers and cognitive biases as possible. For example, I addressed the Paradox of Choice by replacing the standard swiping functionality with a button that would instantly match you with someone compatible nearby. I believed at the time that this particular decision would also help mitigate the “chicken and the egg problem” because users would not see how many (or few) others were in their area as I grew the user base.  I knew I wanted to make Playdate centered around activities from the start. I had made most of my friends through common interests and mutual activities, such as playing poker or drinking together. There was also a McGill study that demonstrated that strangers would exhibit friendship-levels of empathy after playing a video game for 15 minutes together. I figured if two strangers did something that they were both passionate about, this would increase the chance of them getting along. And even if the friendship didn’t stick, neither person would feel like they wasted their time because they were doing something they would want to do anyway. Playdate was always activity-focused, but the big question remaining was which activity to start with. I considered “Magic: The Gathering” because it’s a popular game that requires 2 or more players to play, and Magic players are sometimes known to have trouble making friends. Embarrassingly, I have played against myself in the past because I had nobody else to play with. Ultimately, I decided against Magic and went with cannabis consumption. This was because cannabis is a social lubricant that can help people feel less anxious hanging out with new people and the legalization revolution had begun across the world. I also hypothesized that stoners would be more willing to try an app like this and would be more amenable to giving feedback. In hindsight, this choice of first vertical would be one of the reasons for Playdate’s downfall. ‍"," I would’ve begun development in React Native instead of Swift and Java for faster dev cycles. We could’ve iterated a lot more if we had used React Native from the start. Without any animations or UI performance concerns, Playdate would’ve been much better had we started with React Native. I would’ve also grown the team more slowly, and being more discriminating with friends who wanted to help part-time. Counterintuitively, one lesson I learned in people management is that it is far more stressful to manage someone who unreliably does their work than someone who never does their work or always does it poorly.  The quality of our users was more important than I’d thought from the start. Doing things like growing organically but not virally and playing with campaigns like giving out free stuff for downloads meant that too large a proportion of our users were fake or inactive. It was particularly difficult to separate users we should’ve disabled from those who were waiting for new users to sign up in their area. I also put too much weight on special Silicon Valley events like “pitch competitions” wherein you pitch your companies to a crowd of entrepreneurs and investors. This turned out to largely be a waste of time. The time would’ve been better spent on getting user feedback, development, and chasing smart money through my network. We also applied to some accelerators, none of which accepted us. Got some good photos out of it though (notice the original logo!), and I could still see something like this being the positive expected value.  One thing that we were torn internally about and spent far too much time on was our name. Playdate usually evoked a significantly positive or negative response in people, and despite my best efforts, the team kept bringing up the name without good suggestions of replacements. “Playdate” is already a fairly common word so it had unwanted associations and usernames/domains all had to be “MakePlayDate.” In the end, it didn’t matter and it was a curiously emotional matter for people. ‍"," We knew marketing would have to be done well because we had the classic “chicken and egg problem.” We overcame that by doing things that didn’t scale (initially legally giving away branded bags of cannabis for downloads, co founders automatically matching with users on their first playdate, etc) and by creating content for inbound marketing. We also had a theory that because the app sent curated matches, our users wouldn't see or feel a significant loss in UX based on low user density. This would allow our user base to steadily grow and provide better matches over time, as long as we could retain a good number of users. We explored several marketing avenues, beginning with a grassroots campaign. We created hundreds of branded bags of pot and gave them out to legal adults throughout campuses and popular smoke spots in exchange for app downloads. This was technically legal because we weren’t selling it and it was impossible to construe this as sales because our app was completely free. This also helped us seed a small user base in a small space. This ended up burning us in the end (pun intended) because these users didn't stick around, causing terrible retention and poor matches.  SEO was difficult because we couldn't get many good inbound links (I spent a few hours writing a Medium article but it went nowhere), but we had our SEO bases covered on our website. ASO was much easier by identifying lower-competition, higher-traffic keywords like ""meet people fast"", we were able to become #1 in the App Store for a search for ""playdate"", ""meet people fast"", and ""meet stoners.""  The thing that worked best for us was our inbound marketing. Facebook and Twitter were pretty worthless, and we wrote one blog post which had a really low ROI. Instagram ended up being how we got most of our users. We created an Instagram profile with daily memes that had mild success. We grew to thousands of users by providing people with content they wanted and infrequently converting them into app users. We also paid influencers to advertise us, which was a total crapshoot. Some influencers that we didn't think would do well charged $100 and we got many hundreds of followers. Others that we thought would do much better, like Cheech and Chong's official profile, barely moved the needle.  ‍   "," The old site for Playdate is still live here. If you want to check out our first and only unsuccessful blog post, it’s here. Our Instagram and all the old memes that helped us get thousands of users live here. You can find me here. I currently work at a small startup called Retain.ai (we’re hiring engineers and a designer!)."," I love reading books, and can’t support it enough. I highly recommend reading the classic startup books from The Lean Startup to The Hard Thing About Hard Things to Zero to One. A lesser known book that really helped me rethink how I thought about users and getting actionable feedback was The Mom Test. When I listen to podcasts, I listen to How I Built This by NPR. Startup School’s videos are free and pretty awesome too. ‍"," Our business model couldn’t monetize until we signed venues to pay for coupons, but this was a bit of a catch-22 because we couldn’t get venues to sign up without more users. I burned through about $30-40k when all was said and done over the course of 2 years. I had saved enough money for about 2 years of personal runway, but at the end of the day, I wish I had been about 20-50% more conservative with my living expense estimates and didn’t rely on raising a seed or going through an accelerator.

I’ve been building in the remote collaboration space for the past six years, starting with MyWebRoom, then moving onto Newshunch, and I’m currently the Founder and CEO of Plutoview. Plutoview is revolutionizing remote collaboration by virtualizing applications and moving them to the cloud. By virtualizing them, there’s potential for an unlimited number of people to collaborate in those applications.  With Plutoview, we’re envisioning a world where everyone has equal access to the tools they need to achieve success in their lives and careers. Making that vision a reality will entail users moving applications from their devices to the cloud. We believe that this is the first step to bridging the digital divide.   I worked as a product developer on MyWebRoom, an Internet personalization startup that included VR Rooms. I also worked on Newshunch, a news gamification platform. We were working on gamifying some of the interactions and user experiences in the news media space. I was a Philosophy of Science Major at Boston University. I’ve always been intrigued by big questions, especially those that have to do with the progress of humanity.  During my senior year, I decided to leave Boston University to work full-time on Plutoview. My older brother was a massive inspiration for me. He founded MyWebRoom and then went on to found the renowned startup Grabr.io. I gained loads of experience watching my brother navigate his startup journey. I learned what goes into building a successful startup and was enamored by developing something from scratch that was all my own.",," Underfinancing has been the biggest bottleneck in the early days of Plutoview.  One sales experiment that failed was bringing in an ex-CMO as our interim head of sales. We thought that the experience of this ex-CMO would help us upgrade our sales structure, but in reality, it brought close to no results. This was when we learned that you have to be careful in placing extensive expectations on new hires and that it’s always better to grow your talent in-house.  ",," Plutoview has not only remained relevant in 2021, but it’s soaring into next year with the hopes of growing even larger.  In early 2021, Plutoview joined the Startup Wise Guys, Europe’s hottest and first ever sustainability-focused startup accelerator, as one of its first 11 sustainability startups. The program lasted close to 6 months, during which Plutoview was able to raise $60k.  Later, Plutoview built on its success with Startup Wise Guys and raised another $320k from 2 investors on the back of its transition from a workspace solution catering to remote teams to an API integration provider catering to other workspaces. This was a fundamental transition for the company that opened new avenues of growth. Plutoview also had significant wins in terms of its hires in 2021, onboarding seven new engineers to champion its transition into API. To begin actively scaling our API model, the company has teamed up with Teamflow, an all-in-one virtual office with a similar mission to Plutoview.  Overall, 2021 has been a pivotal year for the present and future of Plutoview. In November, we effectively raised funds by pivoting into API and even earned Product Hunt’s Product of the Day. Finally, Plutoview totaled over 200,000 collaborative hours hosted in 2021.  But we are not going to stop there. The company has some ambitious yet attainable goals for 2022. First, I plan to raise the seed round, a significant benchmark for startups in this stage. The company will also onboard the top 10 leading remote workspaces and virtual offices to solidify its collaboration integration category. Third, Plutoview will expand its suite of virtual applications and expand its already extensive use case library. But of utmost importance, I want Plutoview to become recognized globally in its story, mission, and name.  ‍",," We managed to build the first MVP in 2 months, in 2019. In developing the breakthrough virtualization technology, we prioritized scalability. Our goal from Day 1 was to bring an unprecedented number of simultaneous live applications with large user bases. We launched on PH with our co-browsing service in the summer of 2020. We saw enormous success, validating our approach to revolutionizing remote collaboration. We worked on piloting our technology with those who need it most in the Edtech and remote collaboration communities. ",,," The biggest lesson I’ve learned throughout this process is that you have to lead by example. In building such innovative technology as Plutoview, we need to showcase its capabilities and revolutionary power at every opportunity. "," We've always focused on validation above all. This is why we prioritize public launches like Product Hunt (which we have done twice already). We are looking for every opportunity to showcase the incredible technology behind Plutoview. This includes competitions, public launches, live presentations, etc. It’s how we manage to generate a solid amount of inbound leads every month.

184,posture-keeper," Hi, my name is Shirley Tan and I’m based in San Francisco, CA. I believe that I invented a product that is going to improve people lives in the workplace. The device I created is called Posture Keeper (PK). ‍ Explain Posture Keeper at a high level. What is it? PK is a lumbar support system that doubles as a posture corrector/trainer.  The big problem I am trying to solve is to help prevent people from leaning forward into their computer screen, as well as make them aware when they slouch so they can self-correct right away.  ‍ What's your title? What's your job duties right now in at Posture Keeper? I am the inventor, but also the founder of my new company. It's a small startup. It's just me and my cousin, and help from 3rd party contractors and consultants, mostly friends in the business.  Between me and my cousin, we do everything. Everything has my fingerprint on it. ‍ What's your business model? We’re launching the product on Kickstarter to start out with. Once we fulfill our campaign promise, we intend to sell the product in our Shopify Store, as well as on Amazon. Currently, our model is direct to consumer, by which we can get direct feedback from the Posture Keeper community to help understand what is important to them and what we can do to continuously improve, not just the product, but also the customer experience.  ‍",," Wow! Lots of obstacles. In the beginning, everything was going swimmingly. I felt the Universe was helping me, that was my destiny – I filed the patent and hired a marketing agency. This didn’t work out too well. They were super nice people but I think we were just not on the same page on what I expected the deliverables to be, so it was an uphill battle ever since. I’m basically the general contractor now and I have to find a lot of subs to help me cross the finish line. It was really bumpy for 3 weeks, but some of the consultants I’m working with really came thru for me like Declan Dunn, who is a veteran online marketer. I’m super lucky that I have a supportive husband. Since I also manage our family money, I haven’t told him quite yet how much I am spending. I hope that I just get to show him a higher bank account balance than before I started this project. All kidding aside, I am super grateful to have a supportive family and friends. I will say that I knew that if I didn’t do this, it would be because I chickened out, and it wouldn’t have been for lack of resources but a lack of courage. Life is short and I don’t want to wish that I pursued this project when I didn’t. Don’t want to live in regrets. 	 ‍  We’re still at the early stage. I hired a marketing agency that helps with Kickstarter launches. I super like the people who work there. But early on, I started getting the feeling that we’re not on the same page. There were several things that I was questioning, and long story short, I kept waiting and hoping that things would improve. I did attempt to clarify things, but after several times, I should have listened to my gut that it wasn’t going to work out. ‍",,," I’m not technical. I wish I could code, use Photoshop and be a better copywriter. Another disadvantage is that we’re a small team, so we all wear many hats. I’m hoping to grow the team over time. Regarding the disadvantages in the market of Posture Keeper, I’m not sure yet. Our product is very demonstrable, so when people see it or try it, they get it right away. We definitely need to stay on top of communicating the benefits that PK provides. Lastly, as for our disadvantages in comparison with our competitors, probably the one thing is our product is bigger, so it’s going to cost me more to ship it and get it the hands of the customer. But we’ll figure that out. Right now, it’s more important to get it on the consumers hands, so, as long as we’re not upside down on each transaction, I’m good with that.  ‍"," Wow, there is so much we had to do to get it to where we are today. First, I really prioritized on the design. I’m a worry wart. Because of that, I like to plan. I knew that nothing else mattered if I didn’t get the product design right. I am sure I drove my agent and the factory crazy. I wasn’t willing to even think about launching the product until I knew that the product design was right and that a prototype could be made in the quality I expected it to be and at the price that I thought consumers were willing to pay for. ‍ How long did the process take? This process took me nearly 10 months, I went to China 2x to threw out 2 earlier version. I knew we were on to something with the final version when I got friends and family to try it on. At first, they were like “what is this thing?”. But after I explained what was the problem I was trying to solve, they just nod in agreement. ‍ Who was involved? My cousin Macy, my husband, my kids and our close friends. I think they are all tired of me now. ‍ What resources/tools did you use? I have a great factory agent that I work with and a big network of friends in the business. WarRoom group run by Ryan Deiss, Roland Frasier and Perry Belcher has been a tremendous strategy and networking resource. ‍ How did the initial product look? The initial prototype was horrible. Of course, I didn’t think that at that time, but after some feedback from friends, it was clear that I had to throw 5 months of work and start all over again.  ‍ What sorts of doubts did you have when starting? Will people buy it? Will they use it?  Will they tell their friends about it? The biggest doubt that I had was that some people would say that they didn’t want to be strapped into their chair. I get that, but I think once they see how easy it is to get in and out of the PK, and that lumbar support is so comfortable and really works in keeping them upright, they won’t really think of themselves as being strapped in. Also, some posture correctors were actually pretty crazy. So, I have a pretty good chance there will be a segment of people in the marketplace that will understand the science behind how Posture Keeper works and give it a try.  ‍ Did you enjoy the process of getting started / building it? I did enjoy the process. It’s like being pregnant. I have 3 kids so moms out there can appreciate the analogy. I’m on my eight month and I just want the baby to be born already. ‍ How did you approach pricing your product? I approach everything from the consumer perspective. I’ve compared PK to products out there that were trying to solve the same problem. While there was actually no product out there that was identical to mine, there were, what we call in retail, “law of substitution”. So, I look at all similar products and found out what would people switch to if they thought my product was priced too high. ‍ Did you launch/publicize your product in any way? Did it go as expected? We’re launching on Kickstarter. I hope it goes really well.",," I grew up on a small island called Guam, the one that NK keeps threatening to blow up (before). I came to the US for college, I have a degree in International Business, but I started my first business while I was still in College selling artificial silk flowers. So, my silk flower business evolved into a personalization business when my silk flower supplier moved 2 doors down from my storefront. We had to change our product offerings in a jiffy. I have always been lucky - I had a friend who helped me switch product offerings. Within months, I was able to find a new line to sell without struggling too much (well, it was still a lot of work, but it was also really exciting).  As that business changed, I started a mail order wedding catalog. I was even one of the first supplier to TheKnot, until they built their own fulfillment facility. Then I discovered the Yahoo eCommerce platform in 1997 and decided to open our first online storefront. It was definitely a learning curve. I am not technical so I can’t code to save my life (even to this day). That prodded along. Eventually, I sold my share of the retail storefront to my partner and purchased his share of the online store. The day the ink dried on the contract, April 1st, the site got penalized by Google. So now I had the challenge of trying to get it back to page 1 on different keywords. It took us 6 months, but we did it. And this time we were ranking in a better spot – we crawled our way up to page 3 from page 11. I taught myself SEO, made lots of friends in the SEO community and eventually our site made it to page 1 for multiple search keywords. Then I built several websites, designed and imported a line of bags all to support our main business which was personalization.  After a few years, I sold the business to the world renown wedding platform called TheKnot. Since then, they have closed the site down. My baby has gone, but I am really proud of what I was able to learn and accomplish through that experience. I worked for TheKnot for a year and then I left and took some time off. During the year 2010 was when all the back pain really went into full cray mode. I had been working a lot of long hours. That was part of the reason I left my job – I thought I just needed the rest.  So, I renovated the house, stayed home with my kids, started thinking about what I would do next. I love business, my business, other people’s business, and I thought that one way that I could continue to learn is to work with other business owners. I love trying to understand how people make decisions, why people do what they do – it has always fascinated me. So, I just started consulting. I soon realized that, since I was relatively new to the consulting world, I needed something to get me in front of eCommerce business owners, who wanted to improve their business process, grow their revenue and build up their team. So, I decided that one way to let people know that I could help with that was to write a book. It also helped me in getting speaking gigs and interviews. Overall, I just wanted people to know what they were getting themselves into when they decided to go into eCommerce. It's not a build it and they will come, it's not a set it and forget it. It’s a lot of work and people needs to be prepared for that. Throughout this period, I was on my computer a lot and my back pain was getting worse. I consulted for a while and then I went to work for Yahoo for a few months. When all was said and done, our team got laid off and so I had to decide what to do next. I decided that I really missed the retail business – It was my true passion. By then, the retail and eCommerce landscape had really changed – it was now Amazon’s world. So, I turned my energy into learning the ins and outs of Amazon. We’re selling a few products on Amazon, nothing tremendous that I can brag about – More struggles than winners, but it really taught us a lot.  Back in early 2017, a good friend encouraged me to speak about a product idea I had a few years back. That person was Kevin Harrington, one of the original Sharks on The Shark Tank programme. I drew the product for him and I sent him a video of my first prototype. He was pretty intrigued and he told me about another product that I actually never heard of. He also basically said to me that he thought my posture corrector/trainer was a great product and that I should pursue it. So, with his encouragement, I just started hunting down a factory that I could work with. I then kept working on the product design until I finalized on the new version that we have today."," I wish I had spent more time on in the beginning building an email list.

Next thing: In the early stages of the business I was lucky to hire some talented young guys, for whom Price2Spy was the very first job. The challenge comes 4-5 years down the road, when a young engineer wants to make a move (either because he wants to learn new technologies or to change business focus, or simply leave Serbia). It will be very difficult to keep such a guy, no matter how happy you try to make him. 2015, 2016 and 2017 were tough for me because I lost some very valuable developers this way. I have tried to solve this by hiring seniors, which did not work well so now I’m back to the proven tactics: I keep getting fresh young developers, who (if they stay long enough) will become very productive until the moment when they leave when they will get replaced by the younger ones. An important part of our selection process is a psychological evaluation. This helps us understand which candidates are a good fit for long-term employment. The 3rd challenge can be described as ‘victims of our own success’. Basically, when starting this business, development resources in Serbia were abundant and thus pretty affordable. As you can imagine, we were not the only that enjoyed such a success. Over time, hundreds of western companies opened their development offices in Serbia, and thousands of small Serbian businesses popped up, offering outsourced software service globally. This resulted in 2 problems: A steep rise in development salaries.Lare deficit of experienced development resources. As for personal life, I was lucky enough that my wife was patient enough and full of understanding with myself being constantly connected, no matter if we’re traveling for a skating contest (both of our daughters are in figure skating) or on a long-deserved holiday.   Being from Serbia can be considered both as an advantage (lower project costs) and as a disadvantage (no experience with enterprise clients). I wish I had a business partner from the western world who would be in charge of sales and marketing, while I could run operations and R&D.  Over time we have learned that some of our competitors have solved some problems in a technologically much more advanced way than we did. Each time we identify such a situation, we try to improve our technology stack. This can be cumbersome, as it means even higher development costs. But I consider it important in order not to lose pace on the market. Lack of ambition (‘moderate ambition’ as I prefer to call it) may be another disadvantage. Very few IT businesses are happy with 25-30% annual growth. On the other hand, I consider it good enough in the long run. There is a Serbian saying that could be translated as: ‘’Those who fly high, will fall down low’. I pay too much attention to ‘legacy projects’. We have software development clients from 12-13 years ago, which are becoming more of a burden, rather than being profitable. I find it difficult to say goodbye to such clients. I feel that I have to keep my commitment, although they are not my main focus anymore. Speaking of staff, for quite a long time I was thinking that certain important people couldn’t be replaced. This led to really awkward situations, which were by no means good for the business. And once those people left, I learned that they could, in fact, be replaced and that some replacements worked even better than the one who had left. On the side, I sometimes take businesses too personally. Winning an important client gets me really high, losing a client can take me really low. I can get really passionate in arguments, as well. I’m far from perfect CEO, but I’m trying to improve, and I’m willing to learn.  ‍",," To put it simply, my goal is sustainable growth. For the last 3 years, we’ve been growing 25-30% year on year. I would like to grow at a somewhat faster pace, but I would not like that to happen at the expense of my personal life, and I believe most of the people I have in key positions feel the same. In other words, the goal isn’t to grow fast but to grow for a very long period of time. As for profitability, we’ve been profitable since day 1. However, I must say that during the last few years, I have noticed that profitability has been going down (due to increased costs of labor in Serbia). That’s something I have to tackle in the coming months. Speaking of client structure, I would like to gain more enterprise-level clients, simply because such clients are easier for making long-term plans. Hiring more FTEs is an essential part of that plan. I’m very proud of the fact that we have developed a very strong team in the rural part of Serbia, which is economically in very poor conditions. Once in a while, I visit our office there (the only IT office in 30 Km radius) and that fills me with great pride. I’m also thinking of international expansion. One day I hope to have a sales presence in the US and Western Europe, maybe even far East. Last but not the least, we try to stay innovative. In 2018 we launched JustLikeAPI, a startup service for capturing data from various social networks. Unlike Price2Spy, which is focused on product price, JLA focuses on reviews/comments. It is fighting for development resources with Price2Spy all the time but I find this good for both projects. As for personal goals, I try to find more time for my wife and 2 teen daughters (the elder one recently said: “my father acts as CEO of this family, and as a father to the company which he founded”). I also try to combine business with pleasure, for example, a trip to a football game combined with a visit to a nearby client. In essence, the plan is to stay around for as long as possible. And in order to do that, I know I need to have good and loyal associates, which can take some pressure off my shoulders. That’s why I have recently started a profit-sharing schema which involves some of the key people in the company.",," As every other software project, we started by analyzing what did our potential customers need. In our case, that was easy because we were building Price2Spy according to the needs of Takolako. The process did not take too long (around 3 months) as we were already very experienced building web apps in Java for our outsourcing clients. Apart from myself, acting as PM / business owner, the project was carried out by 4 engineers, none of them working full time on the project. At this point, I came with different thoughts about Price2Spy that would later define the different paths I took: “I’m building a tool for online retailers. Online retailers are very busy people, they will appreciate if a tool can help them save some time. However, they are very careful with their expenditures, so my pricing shouldn’t go too high”“The fact that we’re based in Serbia doesn’t help at all. Serbia (at that time) is more known for troubles, than for quality software engineering.”“As I don’t have a big marketing budget, I have to build a strong website with a lot of content in order to win organic visits.”“I don’t have to rush, as I have other projects running, which are profitable enough.”“Things don’t  need to be all about happy faces like ‘use our tool and all your problems will be gone’. My clients are experienced online retailers who know that there are no simple solutions to important problems.” However, no matter how clear it seems I had all things, there were 2 issues which gave me a great deal of trouble in the early days of the project: ‍ 1) How should I name the tool? Thanks to our online stores, I already had quite some experience with SEO so I knew that the name should be self-explanatory. Therefore, it should definitely contain the word ‘price’ as it was all about pricing. However, as you may guess, all good and simple names were already taken. In our internal conversations, we kept saying that this tool was good because it would help retailers spy on competitors. Hence the name Price2Spy, which I find pretty strong. However, the word ‘spy’ is rather controversial, and has many negative connotations, that you’re simply unaware of if you’re not a native English speaker. Put it together, I think the name has helped us win the market in a very quick way, but harmed our efforts to win top enterprise clients  2) How should I price our services? How do you price a tool which helps others price their products? In the very early days we came up with a very easy way to capture prices from many different websites, so I decided not to limit the number of competitor websites but just focus on the number of products to be monitored. Since we had an eCommerce business of our own, we could measure the impact of using such a tool. The conclusion was that the pricing should start rather low ($19.95 USD per month, for up to 100 URLs to be monitored) since we wanted our clients to have a cheap entry-level fee, which could be upgraded once they felt the benefits of the service were great. Nowadays, (after 9 years in business) we believe we should have started with higher prices. On the side, it was clear that we had to stimulate our clients to grow, so the more URLs they monitored, the lower the ‘price per URL’ was. ‍ Did I enjoy the process? Very much, but to be honest, I think I was not aware I was enjoying it. I love creating new things and solving problems no one has properly solved before. On the other hand, Price2Spy was a baby project, among several other projects I was running on a daily basis, all of which required quite some attention. Nowadays, looking back, I see that I was very lucky to possess a number of skills that were needed to make it a success. Among these were that: We were already very experienced in software development.We knew we didn’t have to spend much money/effort upfront. Instead, we had to launch something simple and if it worked, it would start bringing profits which would justify investing more time and money into development.We were aware of the importance of SEO.We were under no financial pressure, meaning that we weren’t looking for instant success.We were building a tool for eCommerce professionals and I consider myself to be one that kind. Price2Spy was launched in April 2011. We got our first trial clients in May and the first payment (which made me so happy) on Aug-13 2011. ",," In 1996, as a young Software Engineering graduate, I got my first job in Serbia’s first ISP (Internet Service Provider). At a time, Serbia was recuperating from bloody war in Balkans (1991/1995), so the economy and the IT infrastructure were really poor. As a young engineer I was tasked with building some of the first websites in Serbia. I liked it so much that I started creating websites in my own time - first for my hometown (Bijeljina in Bosnia), then for my favorite bands (Oasis, etc) and finally my favorite football club - FC Red Star Belgrade. People in our part of the world are passionate about football, so when first FC Red Star’s website went online - it attracted huge number of visitors (at that time - ‘huge’ in Serbia meant a couple of 000s visitors per day) - mostly Serbs living abroad, nostalgic about their favorite football club. I was acting as both webmaster and content (forum) moderator. Soon enough, I started receiving emails like ‘where can I buy Red Star jersey?’. I started replying like ‘Sorry, no official merchandise is available yet’, but after 5 or so such emails, I figured out that there was an opportunity. So, I built my first online store, arranged the way to receive payments from abroad (which was a nightmare at a time in Serbia).  Few months later, Serbia (actually, at that time it was still called Yugoslavia) qualified for the World Cup Football (France 1998) so I saw an opportunity to sell national football gear. However, there was a political problem - Red Star supporters were hard-core Serbian nationalists, and they would not tolerate Yugoslav football jersey in their fan store. So I had to build my 2nd store (YU Sport Shop). When the time came to open the 3rd such store, I realized I needed a generic software that could run N stores in parallel. Like many other young Serbs, I had left my country (I lived in Holland for 6 years), but I hadn’t shut down the business. I had found partners who would take care of orders and the merchandise itself, while I was still busy with online part of the work. By 2005, when I moved back to Serbia (which is not so common, very few Serbs that go abroad actually do go back), we were running  5 stores, all of them targeting Serbis living abroad. Another thing that really helped was the fact that I started getting outsourced web development  projects for Dutch, German and US clients. I hired one developer (who is now Price2Spy’s CTO), then a 2nd one, etc - I remember that somewhere in 2008 I wrote my last piece of code, as I figured out I couldn’t keep running the business and doing the actual coding.  In 2008, an idea was born: to build a general-purpose online store for Serbian market, selling consumer electronics, sports equipment, fashion, etc, and that idea became takolako.com - one of the first Serbian Allround eCommerce stores. As TakoLako was growing (in 2010 we already had 10 FTEs), we become aware of the competition undercutting our prices. My first reaction was: “Ok, lets monitor competitor prices, so we can make our own pricing decisions.” The way we started doing it was that each category manager would open an Excel file of his/her own, and on each Monday he/she would check prices of most important products on competitor stores. After only 3 weeks, all category managers wanted to speak to me - they considered the task of competitor price checking utterly dull, and taking so much time. They asked me whether they really had to keep doing it. And that’s when the bell rang - this is something that should be automated. After all, we considered ourselves a software company - we had to be able to do better than this! We started working on a simple tool that would monitor competitor prices for us, and generate alerts when someone dropped their prices below ours. It worked like a charm. Our prices were more competitive, my product managers had more time for creative tasks, and things got so much better. In only 6 months since we started using the tool, we had a 32% increase in sales. This is when I said to myself: “we need to offer this to the world”. It was spring of 2011 - and Price2Spy was born. "," Life doesn’t give you any second chances, does it? However, if I did get a 2nd chance, I would: Make some decisions more quickly (for example, replacing the ones who are ‘irreplaceable’).Take some more risky moves which are simply not like me. I’m not that kind of personality.Try a strategic alliance at an early stage with someone more experienced in the sales & marketing side of the business.Make a more careful selection of development projects to spend resources on.Travel to meet clients at a much earlier stage. "," Due to my eCommerce background, I knew that online marketing was essential to the project’s success. My strategy went into 3 directions: Adwords: We started with a moderate budget and kept a close eye on the ads’ performance. Pretty soon I discovered we were having a huge number of clicks from countries which we didn’t mean to target and where we had a low conversion (India, Indonesia, Malaysia), so we decided to split our campaigns into 2: West (high budget) vs East (low budget).Strong content: I was blogging about lessons learned from experiences of my clients, such as “Is it worth offering ‘free shipping’ deals” which brought many online retailers founders into knowing the tool.Going public with the list of websites monitored: I know that this sounds controversial, but my logic was ‘If we can monitor thousands of websites, why not say it out loud, with concrete names listed?’. Further, the fact that we monitor that particular website didn’t mean that we were disclosing on whose behalf we were monitoring it. And finally, publicly announcing that we could monitor a particular website also meant that we felt confident that this website would be able to block our traffic. All of the above strategies were purely online and were quite a success. However, I noticed that while very good in attracting small and medium businesses, these strategies did not do well with enterprise-level clients. This is why in 2015 we started attending trade shows and professional conferences, in some cases as sponsors, in some cases just a s regular attendees. The result was mixed if we attended a trade show industry where we were particularly strong, the success was great. However, in the case of industries that we were trying to get a foothold into, the results were very poor. Put it together, the results were inconclusive so we decided to invest more into what was already performing well (online marketing) while keeping conferences, but selecting them really carefully. Speaking of revenue, I remember the first time I seriously analyzed Price2Spy revenue was in 2013. Until then, Price2Spy was a side income and whatever it brought in was considered a success. The development resources it required were already there (most of the time working on other projects, for our outsourcing clients) so we were practically working on Price2Spy in spare time. In 2013 I hired the first account manager to handle support questions and that was a clear sign that Price2Spy was becoming a viable source of income. However, 2015 was the turning point, as 2 important things happened Out of the blue, we got an offer to sell Takolako. By that time, I was seeing that our eCommerce business was stagnating and taking too many resources from a much more profitable project (Price2Spy). On the other hand, the fact that we had a very diverse and profitable business meant that we were able to negotiate a fairly good price. After a couple of months, Takolako had a new owner and we had offloaded other eCommerce stores into a new legal entity with me as a majority owner and with an experienced and loyal colleague acting as a CEO.‍Our largest client for outsourced web development got into some financial troubles so he cut our contract. While it was a significant financial blow it also meant that our 6 most experienced developers could now spend their full time on Price2Spy. And fortunately enough, Price2Spy was at that stage earning enough to keep paying them. From that moment on, Price2Spy got our absolute focus. We still do some development gigs (as we have some very loyal clients from our early days), but put it all together financially speaking, Price2Spy means now 93% of our income. ‍"," You can check Price2Spy here, and the mother company, WEBCentric, here.

186,processkit," My name is Brian and I'm the founder of ProcessKit, a SaaS solution for teams, especially those doing client services, who want to build out processes and use them to drive their repeatable projects, like new customer onboarding and providing clients with monthly deliverables. I come from a background of building several bootstrapped businesses and I become more known for building productized services or taking client service businesses and turning them into productized businesses where teams just have to execute a package of services very efficiently, following defined processes that continue to work as the company scales. That's sort of what led to ProcessKit. The other thing I run today is a productized service company called AudienceOps. We're a team of 25 people, as of today, where we do a done-for-you blog content service. We basically power the blogs of many other software and service companies. The business largely runs without me, nowadays, as I've got people running sales, the client service, etc, so that I can spend my whole time (and part of profits) building and rolling out ProcessKit. I come originally from a background as a designer and front-end web developer, doing a lot of work with WordPress. However, in recent years, I learned more about building the back-end side of things, becoming sort of a full-stack product designer. But I do come from a background more on the design side of things. ",," The biggest challenge faced, over my entire career, has probably been working as a solo founder. I have worked with partners in the past and I have some smaller side projects that I run with partners, such as co-hosting a podcast and co-running a small conference. I like those kinds of small partnerships, but when it comes to my main business, I have just never really found out a great business partner to build an entire company with. I'm friends with a lot of really great talented founders, but they're all working on their other things.  The way I've overcome working as a solo founder is by befriending and being part of communities. I travel out to conferences and I've met a lot of friends through that. Now my friends and I get together three or four times a year at small retreats where we go and do something fun, like skiing and snowboarding, and then we talk business. We even, personally and through Slack, try to advise each other on our businesses. I would definitely recommend getting involved in some communities to anyone, whether you have partners or not. It can really do wonders for your career just meeting people and learning and sharing notes along the way.   I always feel like I'm at a bit of disadvantage of being a solo person. I have seen how partnerships can work out really well and you can get work done very efficiently, so being soles founders puts me behind the competition with a team of founders. However, over the years, I've become much more comfortable in that role of driving everything forward myself again. I overcame that by relying pretty heavily on my advisors and friends, other founder friends and mentors. Some of the worst mistakes are also sort of related to partnerships. In the years ago, I partnered up with a few people with whom I didn't have a history. I think that within 30 days of meeting them, we decided to partner up on a product idea and we just didn't really see eye to eye on things. Needless to say that that partnership didn't work out. If you are going to partner with someone, I think you need to have a prior working relationship with him/her. Of course, it also has to make sense in terms of skills and finances. The other thing I commit a mistake with was not learning back-end technologies until 2018. I feel like I should have done it sooner in my career. I’ve always stayed away from Javascript, Ruby, databases, etc because I felt like I wasn't that type of developer for too many years. When I decided to devote my time to it, I actually learned a lot and I felt really comfortable with it. Nowadays, it’s something I really love. ",," I really enjoy what I'm doing right now, working on software every day and designing products, so I would love to continue doing that for a while. In terms of hiring, I’ve recently hired a developer and I might, at some point, hire a customer support/success person. But one of my goals with this new business, compared to my other businesses, is to try and keep the team pretty small. In AudienceOps, we currently are a team of 25, and growing, working remotely. That’s a really great team, but now that I'm working on software products, I would like to have more of a small but collaborative team that can get together in person a few times a year (but mostly work remotely). I intend to continue to work on a self-funded bootstrapped basis. I would never rule out the idea of taking funding, but I just haven't seen the need for it. Now that I have a couple of businesses running profitably, I can use those profits to fund the next thing - that's been sort of the pattern that I've followed my whole career so far and I would expect that to continue in terms of projects and features. As for ProcessKit, we want to continue evolving and driving towards that goal of getting your client services to scale and work more predictably and efficiently. Most of the core product is built so we now need to focus on the power features like automation workflows built into processes so that processes can automatically adapt to whatever project the business is working on. That's the whole idea behind process-driven projects.",," It's kind of an interesting story as I took a really different path than most startups do. By 2018, I got a little bit tired of not being able to build my own software ideas on the back end. As a designer, I felt like I should be able to design a product from 0 to a functioning version. I also began to think the work of a designer was all about the user experience and the user interfaces and how those pieces come together to solve a real problem. That kind of thing in the past I'd always outsourced and hired developers to do would end in 2018, as I spent the whole year doing a deep dive into learning how to build applications using Ruby on Rails. I had my other business, AudienceOps, running alone and being profitable, so I was able to dedicate all of my time (30-40 hours/week) to learn how to build complete applications. I took some courses, worked with some mentors, and did a lot of both simple and complex practice projects simple. By the end of the year, I was actually able to build a very simple, but real live, software product called Sunrise KPI. It's a simple tool for gathering key metrics from different tools like Google Analytics or Stripe and pulling those into daily email reports. It was a problem that I wanted to solve for myself - I wanted to get a hold of my numbers every day while I was drinking my coffee. Then, as I got into the beginnings of 2019, I started to really break ground on ProcessKit. I spent from January to June 2019 building the product( Ruby on Rails, Vanilla JS with Stimulus JS, HTML, SCSS and Heroku) and since then until today, enhancing it. In June we started bringing on the very first paying customers. I'm still the lead designer and developer on ProcessKit today but I do have another developer who works with me. We’re able to push the roadmap forward pretty fast these days.",," I went to school to study audio production and engineering, and have been a long time musician, composer, and songwriter. At that time, I started working at some odd jobs, such as waiting tables and pizza delivery, but nothing related to web design or web development. I thought I was going to spend my whole life working in recording studios. Turns out there isn’t much money in that industry, so I saw myself being forced to make a pivot into another passion I later found out, which was designing things for the web. This is how I got into a NY web design agency, where I really brought my hack amateur web skills up to kind of a professional level. I worked there for 3 years before moving to web design freelancing work. I started doing a lot of Wordpress work for clients and built a business called Restaurant Engine, which was a web design service for restaurants and hotels (I later sold that in 2015). Before ProcessKit and for the previous 5 years, I’ve been working on AudienceOps. My work here is what inspired the latest business. I found that existing tools to manage the business weren’t thought for client services and weren’t made for process-driven work. I was constantly duct-taping different tools to make something usable and I got to know other client-service businesses that were doing the same. That’s when I made the click. ",," Before ProcessKit, I’ve built up an audience of other client services, software, agency, and consultancy business founders. I had talked a lot with them and taught many the concept of productized services. Part of this community came from a course and community I run that’s called Productize, two podcasts about bootstrapped and productized businesses and a weekly newsletter where I give updates on what I’ve been working in. This audience is a perfect fit for ProcessKit, so that’s where the firsts order interest came from. That’s also where my customer research interviews, early beta testers group, and first paying customer came from. Now that about a year in, ProcessKit is starting to grow beyond my personal audience. We have some organic traffic coming in from different sources and some word of mouth. I'm also starting to do a lot more work on the positioning of ProcessKit. I’ve recently finished doing a deep dive into a lot of customer interviews and surveys so as to really dial in the messaging and find out who this product is for.  In the upcoming year, I plan to do more around partnerships related to working with other people who speak to client services agencies as well as process consultants (people who consult businesses on their processes), and a number of other marketing strategies like SEO and content.

After six months of growing Profitabilly, I asked myself, “...do I want to run Profitabilly for the next five years? Do I enjoy running it?”. My answer was no. Even though Profitabilly successfully had ten paying users, I wanted to find something I enjoyed more. I then decided to shut it down. Because of my lack of passion, I didn’t carried out the marketing seriously. I didn’t submit Profitabilly to Product Hunt, BetaList or write a blog post. Also, Profitabilly’s Instagram page only had 200 followers.  When I made the final decision to shut it down, the first thing I did was tell my existing customers about it.

The main reason why I only had one pricing model was that I wanted to keep it simple and I didn’t want to spend more time building a complicated billing system.",," I have a small software development agency working on various projects. For daily operations, I was using standard accounting and project management software. The problem with standard accounting software is that it can’t easily track all of my expenses and profit for every project I needed to filter for it. As I was managing a lot of projects, it became a pain. This was especially true when I gave projects to a contractor and I wanted to make sure they stayed on budget. The idea for Profitabilly was born when I opened my project management software one day. I started to add a task for my upcoming project, and I had a thought to mix project management software with accounting software.  The main idea was simple: You only add a project with a due date, and then you start to log every transaction which would be in the project. For example, billing, contractor payment(s), among others. In the end, the software would calculate all of your costs from each transaction and show your true profit (if any) from the project with all of your specific costs tracked with the corresponding reasoning/task ‍"," If I could start over, I would build it only for myself and not sell it to others. I hope I would ask myself in the beginning, “...will I enjoy running this for the next five years? Am I really passionate about it?”. I also regret not having an audience. No matter how good your product is, if no one knows about it, it’s useless. Now I have started a blog to build an audience, and so far it is working good. ‍"," At the time, I didn’t have an audience from an email list or a social media account. I did, however, have the motivation and sales skills to do a lot of cold emails and I was good at speaking one-on-one with people thanks to my agency business. My primary strategy was using cold emails and social media for attracting users. I didn’t have a good result with my social media marketing. I tried some social media ads, but the conversion was terrible I definitely need to learn more about social media marketing. For cold emailing, I got much better results--even though it required more effort. I mainly tried to reach companies in the services industries like construction and marketing agencies. Only getting ten paying users required a ton of cold emailing and follow-ups.  I used tools like Mailtrack to track opened emails, Snov.io to find email addresses, and Gmail as an email provider (so that my email address would look more personal). 70% of my emails were opened, but only a small number of them actually replied to me.

188,pull-reminders," I’m a 27-year-old developer based out of Chicago. My first experience as an entrepreneur was in middle school when I was hustling modded nerf guns on internet forums. A disgruntled buyer even taught me about customer support by telling on me to my parents when his shipment was delayed. I fell in love with web design when I was in high school and have spent the past 10 years working full-time jobs while building projects on the side. I’ve always dreamed of working for myself so when I left my last job in December I decided to take some time off to try and launch a couple product ideas I had. I launched the first version of Pull Reminders in January and have been bootstrapping it for the past several months. Pull Reminders helps development teams stay on top of pull requests and improve their code review process. You can set up reminders in Slack channels and have everyone receive direct messages about their assigned code reviews. Pull Reminders also provides metrics like pull request size, code review turnaround time, and the number of reviews completed — these help you recognize contributors and improve your team’s processes. Pull Reminders is used by over 400 companies like Pivotal, Instacart, WeWork, and Trivago. ‍",," The biggest obstacles for me have been doubting myself and being a perfectionist. As a solo founder, it can be difficult to stay positive and motivated. I think all creative people deal with fears of being rejected or failing. When you invest so much of yourself into creating something it can be very scary to put it out there. Sometimes I get down about stupid things. For example, if I have one week where my signups decrease or a customer I admire doesn’t purchase a subscription, I start to get negative thoughts. It’s a very stupid thing because my business is growing well and I know I am lucky to be in the position I am.  Another problem I have is being a perfectionist. It’s easy for me to go down rabbit holes and labor over details that aren’t practically benefiting my business. For example, I’ve had to stop myself from wasting time overly refactoring code or redesigning something that looks good enough. I think being a perfectionist can really backfire because when you start over scrutinizing your work, you often end up making it worse. For example, when I was working on my responses for a written interview I started word-smithing things to the point where I was making it longer and more boring. I had my brother and a couple of my friends rescue me by proofreading and telling me to stop.  One big mistake that I continue to make is building large features without testing and validating them along the way. For example, Pull Reminders currently has some reporting features that I don’t think anyone is getting a lot of value out of. I spoke to customers about it before I started and had a good idea of the problems I was trying to solve, but designing reports and data visualizations is very hard without a deep understanding of how, who, and when they’ll be used. As a result, I created something that wasn’t quite the right solution. It would have been better for me to take the process slower and show users mockups of what I could build before I actually built it. I’m now redesigning a lot of my reports based on what I’ve learned, but I could have gotten to the same point faster with a better process. Another mistake I made was spending way too much time and energy trying to get a new logo designed. The logo I have now was designed by me, but a couple of months ago I became infatuated with the idea of creating a cute illustrated logo that was “bot” themed. I spent lots of time reaching out to various designers, writing up briefs, and iterating on different design concepts. Ultimately, I didn’t like any of the concepts and realized my current logo was perfectly good enough. I wasted a lot of time on that whole process which wouldn’t have really made a difference even if it had been successful. ‍",,," To be honest I’m not sure. I mentioned some of my personal weaknesses in the previous section but from a business standpoint I think a lot of my disadvantages are also advantages. For example, my business is a bit fragile because it is completely dependent on GitHub and Slack. But that’s also been a huge advantage because a lot of people can easily adopt my product on top of their existing tools. Being a solo founder can be seen as a disadvantage, but I actually see it as a huge opportunity. Having complete autonomy and low overhead means I can pursue opportunities that most other companies wouldn’t even bother with. ‍"," I built the first version of Pull Reminders in a couple of weeks using Ruby on Rails. I don’t think there’s anything better than Rails for shipping and iterating on a new product. The goal of Rails is to be the “framework for small teams to do big things”, so it’s a great fit when you’re a one-person team. When I took Pull Reminders live at the end of January I had no expectations of making money. I actually planned on letting people use Pull Reminders for free as a marketing strategy for something else I wanted to build. I didn’t have a pricing page or payment form. After launching I started getting a small trickle of signups through the Slack App Directory. I emailed every user that signed up to find out who they were and what they were hoping to get out of Pull Reminders. A couple of those early users were from larger companies and I could tell they were taking my product seriously because they asked for lots of changes. I kept making changes based on their feedback until they seemed satisfied. Finally, I asked if they would be willing to pay. I thought I had about a 30% chance but it worked. Landing those first couple paying customers really blew my mind. It dawned on me that Pull Reminders could be an actual business. To give you a better sense of the timeline, my first payment didn’t come through until March 1. After that, I started converting more and more signups into paying customers and eventually added a pricing page and payment form so I didn’t have to personally ask everyone to pay. I charge companies about $2 per month per developer through preset pricing plans of $10/mo, $49/mo, and $99/mo. Pricing is still a work in progress for me, but I like to justify the $2 per month per developer because it's less than a cup of coffee for each developer and I think Pull Reminders gives you more productivity than coffee. ‍",," I got the idea for Pull Reminders at my last job where I was an engineering manager. We had a pretty standard process for code reviews where we’d open pull requests on GitHub and share them in Slack. I remember one time I asked an engineer on my team what was up with a pull request that had been stale for a couple of days. He told me that he had asked someone for a code review multiple times and had gotten tired of nagging. As time went on I started spending a lot of time monitoring open pull requests and pinging people on Slack that needed to take action. I hated spending my time this way but it really helped the team because otherwise pull requests would drag on and take longer to release. When I left that job last December I couldn’t shake away the idea of building a tool to automate what I had been doing. I was also hesitant because I wasn’t sure if anyone else would want to use it. I’ve probably launched over a dozen projects that have failed so my side project graveyard felt big enough. I overcame this fear by doing more research. I asked some of my peers in a “Chicago CTO” Slack group whether they had problems with pull requests dragging on, and many responded yes. I also looked for existing solutions and found a bunch of ""pull request reminder” projects on GitHub that were similar to my idea. This was proof to me that this was not an uncommon problem."," I think that a big part of turning your idea into a business is having the mental and emotional stamina to keep going, even when things aren’t going well. When I was getting started I wasn’t good at this and would get really affected by the roller coaster ups and downs. These days I actively focus on my mental health and staying positive emotionally. If I’m feeling off I try to take a day or two off to recharge a bit. I’ve found that if you focus on getting into the right mindset, the creative success follows much more easily. ‍"," In April I was able to get Pull Reminders published in the GitHub Marketplace. This felt like a big moment but it took a lot of work and I wasn’t sure what the results would be. Thankfully it’s given me a nice boost in signups and accelerated my growth. Since then I’ve mostly been focused on improving my product. I have experimented with a referral program but it hasn’t gotten any traction. I’m still trying to figure out why. First, I tried to offer a package of free gourmet coffee per referral. Then I switched to Amazon gift cards. Right now, it’s a dual-incentive system where both the referrer and the invitee get Amazon credit. Although I get a steady stream of signups from Slack and GitHub, I’m at the point now where I want to do my own marketing to grow the business faster. My plan is to start writing a lot about my own experiences and create guides for other developers that want to start businesses. My customers are developers so it seems like a nice alignment of what I can write about and an audience that’s relevant to my business. ‍", You can learn more about me on my personal website.

189,puppet-pelts," My name is Laurie Nickerson and I and the co-owner of Puppet Pelts. At Puppet Pelts, we manufacture and sell hand dyed fabric used for puppet skins to professional puppet builders around the world.  Our Pelts are made from a textile that is really only used for puppets. It is a wonderfully stretchy nylon fleece fabric that is milled in the United States. We buy the fabric in white and dye it a bunch of colors to sell to our customers. I was building puppets for fun. I discovered that the fabric you could buy online was only available in white, forcing any puppet builder to have to dye it on their own to change the color. Dyeing the fabric is really difficult in small spaces like apartments where I was living at the time. So, once I got a studio space, I offered dyeing services catered to puppet builders.  ",," The first obstacle was actually before we opened our studio. It is kind of beaten into your head that if you want to start a business, you need to get funding. So, I tossed the idea of getting a business loan. I hated the idea of debt because I have done the student loan rodeo and it is such a downer. So instead, my business partner (and mom) decided to make a go of it without a huge bank loan. Instead, we saved up enough for 6 months of rent and approached the landlord of building with our idea. We wanted to pay 6 months of rent up front if he would knock $200 of rent off per month. Miraculously, he agreed. So we had 6 months of wiggle room to figure things out before we had to turn a profit and actually HAD to pay rent. This was such a great buffer for us. We also decided that we would share our space for the first year while we figured things out.  We split the rent with a woman who was a costume maker. Her business was similar to ours, but different enough where we wouldn’t compete. She ended up staying with us for 4 years and the partnership worked out really well. It cut down on overhead, and we both were able to bounce ideas off each other. Another obstacle was actually figuring out our process. Now, this sounds crazy, but we started a business that we had zero experience in. I had built puppets and dyed fabric just for myself, but never professionally. And when I say I built puppets, I made 4 in total. That’s 4 yards of fleece I dyed before I launched into a business. I was dyeing the fleece in a plastic tub in my kitchen. But, I knew there was a need for dyed fleece and began to research how to do it on a larger scale. When I first launched, I was dyeing every piece in my washing machine using Rit dye which is what I call, “the gateway dye.” It is available at every craft store and grocery store. So, I bought a bunch of colors and off I went. The challenge came when I tried to recreate the same color twice. Rit has dye particles in it for all sorts of fabric types. So, you dump the dye it, and the dye particles for nylon stick to the fabric and the ones for cotton go down the drain. When you dump out 2oz of the dye into the dyebath, there’s really no way of knowing how many nylon particles are in there. One run might come out darker or lighter even if you put the same 2oz of dye in. I found this SUPER frustrating and it created a lot of waste. I also wanted a way to dye more yardage at a time. So, I began researching other methods of dyeing. Because there’s not a “how-to-dye-puppet-fleece” tutorial online, I started looking at what costume shops were doing. The gal we were sharing our space with was the perfect resource. She had a connection with the Utah Shakespeare Festival, and they had a DYE ROOM! So, we took a day trip out there to meet with their head of costuming for a tour of their space. What an amazing experience. This trip really took our business to the next level. We were able to talk to a guy who not only had dyeing experience but could help us figure out the equipment we need. Ironically, the item we really needed was a GIGANTIC soup pot.  We also were introduced to acid dyes. They are a much more stable dye where you measure the pigment out exactly, based on the weight of the fabric. So, every run of that color comes out the same. SO BRILLIANT. With the knowledge we needed to switch to acid dyes and purchase a giant soup pot, we took a leap of faith and financed the equipment. Our 60-gallon soup pot, whom we lovingly call Gertrude, was over $10,000. She was our first real investment into the business. When she arrived, we had to learn the new process of dyeing with acid dyes. We had to just try colors out to see what happened. We had to rebuild our swatch library from scratch because the Rit dye wasn’t compatible with Gertrude. Again, there was a ton of trial and error and figuring out our process. But, I feel we are finally in a place now where we have everything down and can call ourselves “professionals.” ‍  The biggest mistake was in our pricing. When we first started, we priced the fabric based on materials, but not really our time. So, about a year into it, we raised our prices. I was so nervous to do so. I thought people wouldn’t buy our fleece anymore and that everyone would be mad. Basically, I was reacting with my heart, not my brain. What I learned though was, if the product is good quality, people will buy it even at a higher price. We opted to have a range in price so we wouldn’t price anyone out of using the fleece. Our value for Core Colors starts at $27 per yard. These are either mill-dyed in bulk, or dyed by us in large batches. They are typically in stock at all times and have your basic color selection. If you want something a bit different, or an usual shade, you will pay more for the premium colors. We have found that new builders who want access to the fleece will splurge to buy a yard at $27, but maybe not $38 for a premium color. Once they get better at building, they then will move up to the more expensive pieces.  ",,," A big disadvantage is not having solid accounting skills. The biggest time-suck we have now is doing our books. We use Quickbooks, and I don’t care what anyone says, that program is not quick or easy. If we were to do it all again, we would definitely take a course in “Quickbook for dummies.” We have always been the type to just, “figure things out as we go” but with accounting, it isn’t something that comes easily to us. So it was, and is, a huge cause of panic and angst."," I started by getting one roll (50 yards) of white nylon fleece from our fabric distributor, Larry. And, when I say Larry, he is the only guy on the planet who has access to the fleece mill. Up until this point, to obtain the fabric, you had to know about Larry (he only has a phone number, no website), or shop at another online store that only carried it in white, or a few select colors. (That shop also got their fleece from Larry.) Larry used to run a mill and he fell into this world of puppets as well. Jim Henson approached him about a textile he was making for the interior of shoes. So the two of them created this unique “skin” for puppets. Larry has since sold the mill and now is just a fabric distributor. He is like this mythical elusive fleece unicorn. The dyes we started off using were essentially, craft dyes. They were really unstable and hard to reproduce colors time and time again. So, there was a lot of frustration there. After about two years of fighting these dyes, we switched over to acid dyes which allow us a lot more control. ‍",,," I would have started sooner. It’s a bit daunting to take a leap of faith and put yourself out there. And especially with my business, I still get a lot of weird looks when I tell people “I dye Muppet skins” for a living. There’s always the folks who never really understand that you can make a living in the arts. So my advice to anyone reading this is, it is okay to march to the beat of your own drummer and go against the grain. It took me a while to find my beat, and that’s okay. The point is, I found it eventually and I could not be happier.  "," I was lucky enough to have a super niche market. Puppet makers also really love to talk about process and share information on materials. There’s a Facebook page called Puppet Maker’s Workshop and it just is a group for puppet makers to post photos of what they are working on, and questions they have if they get stumped. When I first launched, I posted a message there explaining I was now offering dyed fabric. About 99% of people find out about our company through this Facebook page. I started off by replying to questions, and comments about our product, but now people do that for me atomically. “Oh, you are looking for fleece? Send a message to Laurie at Puppet Pelts.” I also really love this venue because it allows me to be a “human.” If someone is working on a budget and can’t afford to use our fleece, it is important for me to let them know that puppets can be made out of anything. They don’t HAVE to be made with our fleece.  But, by being accessible, when they do have the budgets to use higher quality materials, they know where to find me. I also started running Facebook ads. What I was surprised to discover that there’s a huge number of puppet makers in Mexico that didn’t know our company existed before I started these ads. Initially, I used data collected over the past couple of years to determine which countries purchase from us the most. Our ads were then targeted to those countries. On a whim, I added Mexico to the list. While only two or three orders were shipped there, the orders we did have were large. So, I figured, “why not.” What I discovered was that once I started running Facebook ads in Mexico, it became one of the top countries for impressions and click-throughs. It also resulted in an in-studio visit from someone visiting Vegas on vacation, and a big increase in orders from Mexico made through our online shop. What I love about Facebook ads is that we can set our budget. Right now, we are spending $30 a month. It makes it really easy to reach potential customers. Another avenue I explored was partnering with puppet builders. One of our customers has a youtube channel where he teaches people how to build puppets. He approached me and asked about potentially swapping material for a shout out on his channel. We sent him a box of a range of skin tones and in exchange, he added our store to his list of supplies. It’s actually working out really well. We get a lot of hits from first-time builders who are new to the puppet world that way."," You should check out our website.

190,qor360," I’m currently an emeritus professor here at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont. After a long career as an academic trauma surgeon, I spent a decade as a research epidemiologist. But for the last 5 years, I’ve been engaged in trying to understand the cause of low back pain to solve this nearly universal complaint. Oddly, this required that I create a startup to build and sell an entirely new kind of chair. So, unexpectedly at the age of 71, I find myself running a company, QOR360.com. It’s clear that people are going to continue to sit, and sit a lot, no matter how often they are told that “sitting is the new smoking”. So, to deal with the public health crisis caused by sitting in badly designed “ergonomic” office chairs we had to be able to offer folks an entirely different way to sit, one that would allow them to move while sitting. Although there were a few such “active” chairs on the market, they were poorly designed, or too expensive to be a real solution. So, to change the way people sit, I became a reluctant entrepreneur and the CEO of a startup. Our business model is simply to help people sit better by introducing the idea of sitting actively to as wide an audience as possible. This required that we create a solid chair that could be sold at a price everyone could afford and yet was not so ugly that no one would want one.   ",," It seems obvious that once we’d invented a better way to sit we would partner with a large office chair company and let them do the heavy lifting of manufacturing and distribution. But despite my best efforts, I couldn’t get “Big Chair” (Steelcase, Heman Miller, etc.) interested. They seem to be fixed in their approach to sitting, and new ideas simply weren’t welcome. But it’s been ever thus: as the famed Nobel Laureate Max Plank observed over 100 years ago: “A new truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.” So, we’re busy upending what a chair is. Eventually, the Steelcase’s of the world will wake up, but by then it may be too late for them. So, I’d say our biggest obstacle has been “Big Chair”. These guys have defined what a chair is for the last century: a chair must have a backrest, a footrest, armrests, a headrest, and the coup de grace, “lumbar support”. It’s hard for our chairs which sport none of these distractions to good posture to be taken seriously. But slowly, slowly, our take on sitting is gaining ground. It’s hard to say where the tipping point is but we’re getting there. We haven’t made any catastrophic mistakes yet, but I’m pretty sure we will. It’s impossible to get everything right. I’m quite happy to place “little bets” that may or may not work out. What I’m very cautious about is making big bets, because if a big bet doesn’t pan out, well, you may lose your company and all the hard work that your team has put into the project. ",," We’re pleased with how our business is doing, but we are always looking for our next move. We’re partnering with a group in Taiwan to bring active sitting to the Taiwanese, and we’re in early conversations with a company in Great Britain and an entrepreneur in Australia.   Our team philosophy is a little unusual, I think. Most businesses start with an organizational chart and then try to find people who fit in the boxes. We work the other way round: when someone shows up with skills and a passion for our project we draw a box around them and fit them into our organizational chart somehow. It can sometimes be a challenge, but it plays to every player’s strengths and makes for a much stronger company. We’re always working to bring down the cost of our chairs, and we’re working on new designs that will be fully functional but less expensive than our flagship Ariel chair. My personal goal is to make active chairs so inexpensive that anyone who wants one can afford it. As an epidemiologist, I know that a solution that people can’t afford is no solution at all. So our focus is on solid active chairs that look good and are affordable.   And our chairs do look great. We recently won a design contest for chairs in Europe, the A’Design Competition. This was a little unexpected because all the other chairs in the contest were designed for their visual appeal. Our Ariel chair was the only one in the competition that was designed to solve a health crisis.  My personal goal is to hand this company off to the team that’s made it a success. I’m 71 years old, and I had a long career as a surgeon. I should be comfortably retired, so I’m not in this to pay off a mortgage. Rather, I view myself as trying to help these kids create a company that they can be proud of and will send their kids to college. ‍",," I understood the basic idea of making a chair that would be just unstable enough to encourage, indeed require, continuous muscular effort while sitting. But the actual invention of a reliable, and inexpensive, rocking mechanism required dozens of design failures, some of them hilarious in retrospect. When I finally hit on the idea of using a new geometric solid (an “eccentric bicylinder) as the rocking “mechanism” I instantly knew that this was the solution to the problem because it was a physically beautiful object. This rocker’s shape was the key to our project, but it wasn’t clear how to make them. At first, we were cutting them out of solid wood using a bandsaw with 8” of blade exposed, but this seemed too dangerous we didn’t want anyone to lose a finger as a part of our project. Pretty quickly we found that we would have to injection-mold this component, and although the mold was expensive ($20K), the individual rockers were inexpensive to make once we had the mold. And, the molded rockers were perfect to 1/10,000 of an inch and didn’t require sanding or finishing. We didn’t have a launch for our chairs. We started giving them to friends to evaluate and then selling them to people at local trade shows, and finally, we set up a website to sell them online. The whole process was unplanned. Rather, it emerged organically as we took opportunities that presented themselves. ‍ Our pricing strategy has been simply to sell our chairs as inexpensively as possible. We’re not trying to make money at this point we’re trying to introduce active sitting to as many people as possible. As we continue to scale up I anticipate that our production costs will come down and at that point, we may start to show a profit. With luck, as time goes on we’ll be able to reduce the cost of our chairs and still show a profit.",," Before diving into QOR360 I spent 25 years as an academic trauma surgeon and another decade doing epidemiology. I didn’t get out much. To be a good surgeon, you need to show up every day, because patients have the reasonable expectation that their surgeon is there to solve any problem that arises, and a problem can come up at any time. So, I spent most of my career on a short leash, never more than 15 minutes away from the hospital. The idea that back pain was a problem worth solving was a personal thing for me. I’d seen many patients complaining about back pain when I was an intern working in the emergency room, of course, and I vaguely understood that Western medicine didn’t have a solution for such patients beyond offering pain medicine and reassurance. So I didn’t take a deep dive into the back pain problem until I developed back pain myself. It took a while to riddle it out, but I eventually became convinced that sitting slumped passively all day long in “ergonomic” office chairs was causing immense problems. And not just with our posture and core strength leading to back pain. Epidemiologists estimate that passive sitting takes two years off our lives by playing havoc with our biochemistry, elevating our bad cholesterol, lowering our good cholesterol, raising our insulin lives. Quite simply, sitting passively is a public health catastrophe.  I should add that I’m not the obvious choice to design a product, create a company, or market furniture. But because someone had to address this problem I dove in. Luckily I found a cohort of like-minded souls with skill sets to make all this possible. It proved easy to find such people because they all understood the urgency of the problem. We created our line of active chairs so people would have an alternative to the terrible “ergonomic” chairs that have come to define the 21st-century workplace. Our goal was to make rock-solid active chairs at an affordable price that were attractive enough that people would want them.    I’m new to the world of entrepreneurship and business, so I don’t have prior failures to fall back on for guidance.  But I do have a long history of team building and teamwork because trauma surgery is a team sport.  So, the business of finding talented people and creating a functional team was something that I had long experience with.  And, as it turns out, this is probably the single most important skill a CEO can have. ‍"," Entrepreneurship is a lot more work than I’d imagined. It’s not enough to have a good idea, you also must have your idea at the right time: too early and no one can be convinced, too late and, well, it’s too late. And your idea must seem at least a little impossible: “If it’s obvious, well, it’s too late”. Finally, you must also have the energy and commitment to relentlessly pursue the project until it succeeds or fails. It’s a truism that many viable ideas fail because the entrepreneur simply becomes exhausted. Luckily there are several kids on our team who are far younger than I am and bring great energy and dogged determination to our project. I was lucky to start our startup in Burlington, Vermont, which has a vibrant entrepreneurial community and a terrific maker space, The Generator. So many people were willing to share their time, their ideas, and especially their enthusiasm. I can’t thank them all enough. It was this community that convinced me that my idea for active sitting was worth pursuing."," Growing a company turns out to be a lot harder than inventing or manufacturing a product. The key seems to be simple persistence. We pitched our chairs at trade shows, we pitched our chairs on street corners, we pitched our chairs to podcasters, we pitched our chairs to newspapers, we… Well, you get the idea. Eventually, someone hears you. Our first big success was when a piece about our chairs dropped in the Wall Street Journal. A single short article generated thousands of sales. A single brief mention of our chair as the best chair to upgrade a home office in an internal email at Google generated thousands of more sales. Now it seems to be mostly word of mouth that is selling our chairs. And we’re always looking for new partners to tell our story. For example, we’re working with a father/son team, Tim and Rick Brennan who invented Vivobarefoot shoes to find synergy between our two companies’ projects. The Vivobarefoot shoe solved the problems that restrictive shoes caused for the human foot, and our chairs address the problems caused by office chairs that restrict the human body. So, we have a lot in common with Tim and Rick, but they’ve been in the game for almost two decades, so they have a lot of experience to share with us. We’ve grown from a $100K company to a $1M company in the last two years, and we have aspirations to keep up this pace. So far it’s all been earned media and word of mouth, but we’re currently looking into paid media as a way to further awareness of active chairs as an alternative to passive sitting. ‍", I’ve written dozens of blog posts about aspects of active sitting that are up on our website. We also give away a design for a very inexpensive active chair that anyone can download and make for their kid(s). I’ve written pieces for Elemental that explore some of the science behind active sitting. I also gave a TEDx Talk on the core ideas of active sitting. And I wrote a review article on active sitting for Chiropractic Economics.," Start with a project that matters and find a solution that works. Then find some twenty-somethings who share your vision and get out of the way. The rest will pretty much look after itself. I’ve never taken a business course, so I’ve had to rely on word of mouth from the entrepreneurial community here in Vermont. And books, lots of books. Oddly, however, only a few books have been helpful to me. The Art of the Start 2.0 by Guy Kawasaki was a real eye-opener for me, and a great general reference is The Portable MBA in Entrepreneurship. Also helpful was The Chair, by Galin Cranz. I guess I’m old school, but I find books much more helpful than podcasts or blogs or whatever, because reading is far faster than listening, and you can highlight and write in the margins, habits that make reaccessing information very quick. For fun, I sometimes listen to “How I Built This”. It’s astonishing how much success is predicated on simply being in the right place at the right time.

191,quickhaggle," Hey there! First of all, thanks to Failory for having me on their website. My name is Bilal Ahmad and I am from Pakistan. I have done an MBA, but my interests have always been in computers. I wanted to do a master in Computer Sciences but my Dad wanted me to make a career in Business Administration. While I was studying, I started my career as a blogger in 2008. My first blog was TechMaish, which I am still working on. Apart from the blog, I also do affiliate marketing and freelancing. I have worked with several companies on SEO projects, such as link building campaigns and on page optimization.  One of my previous businesses was QuickHaggle. It was one of my dream projects and I wanted it to be a successful company, but it didn’t work as I expected. I worked on it for a year and tried very hard to make the idea work. But it ended up failing. ‍"," The idea was unique, but it needed a lot of promotion. And not only a lot, but also continuous promotion. This was the reason why I decided to stop. I had already spent more than $4,000 on the site and not a single trade was made on it. This made me feel discouraged and (luckily) help me realize that I should stop making investments in the business. I believe one of the main reason for failure was trust deficit between the parties. Although the rating system was working correctly, if one of the party failed to deliver, then another would waste his skill and time without getting anything in return. I think this was one of the main reasons for the failure of the site. ‍"," The biggest disadvantage was my lack of knowledge about coding. I had to hire freelancers to correct any errors on the site. If I was a coder, this would have made it easier for me to keep operating the site. And I think that if the whole site would have been built in WordPress, it would have been easier for me to operate. My knowledge about WordPress is sufficient and I can operate a WordPress site easily.",,,," The site was built on Titan Classifieds script. For the design, I hired a freelancer on UpWork. The old design of Freelancer was relevant to what I was thinking for QuickHaggle, so I told the designer to use it as an idea and make it unique. The TitanClassified script was modified by the coder to add several features and functionalities to make the idea work. He included, for example, a rating system, so that both parties could give ratings when they were done with the exchange. With this, I also forced both parties to play by the rules and not cheat in the process.",," QuickHaggle was a community in which online users could exchange their skills. For example, if someone was in need of web designing and in return he could offer proofreading services, a person with similar needs and skills could exchange them with him. Thus, both users could get the service they needed, without paying anything. This was the whole idea of the QuickHaggle.  The Idea is similar to Freelancer, but in Freelancer, you have to offer money to get a service. In QuickHaggle, instead, you didn’t need any capital. Thus, both parties engaging in the trade could save money and still get what they needed. The whole idea was based on the barter system. Just like in old ages when people were trading in commodities instead of money. It was difficult for old ages to find the exact commodity in exchange for the exact one that is needed by the other party. However, today, in the age of the Internet, it is quite easy to find what you need as the whole world is globalized with the web.  "," If I had to start QuickHaggle again, I would work on a mechanism where both of the party feel safer when exchanging their skills. For that, I would introduce a system based on a guarantee, where both parties have to agree to deposit an equal amount of money in their respective accounts. If one of the party tries to cheat or does not provide the skill as agreed, then QuickHaggle as a mediator would consider the situation and send that amount of money to the party who has successfully delivered the work. This system would establish trust in both parties and the trade could be completed successfully.    I learned that unique ideas are great, but they usually require much more efforts and money to make them work. The project was very unique and I had limited knowledge and resources to make it work. ‍"," Since the idea was unique and needed a lot of advertising, I first started with Facebook Advertisement and ran several ads to create a word of mouth for it. I spent more than $500 initially on Facebook Advertising. The result was good and people really appreciated the idea. I also used Google Adwords and targeted some specific keywords, but the number of searches was low. That is why I skipped using Google Adwords.  I also wrote on some blogs, like FamousBloggers, in order to create buzz for the idea. The support and appreciation were good and people were liking the idea. But not a single trade was made via the platform. That is why I stopped and let this site die alone. ‍"," You can find more details about QuickHaggle here. I regularly write about technology, blogging and other business-related topics on TechMaish. You can check my Facebook here and my Twitter is @techmaish. Thanks for reading!"," I usually read Neil Patel Blog, Quicksprout and SearchEngineRoundTable in order to keep improving my various skills. I am a full-time blogger and I am always reading content to make my blog better every day. The digital marketing and blogging market is a vast field and you have to be updated all the time. ‍"," I spent around $4,000 on it and made $0 from it. I lost all the investment. Frankly speaking, I was not concerned about the money I invested, but I am really sad that the idea did not work. I liked the idea very much and really wanted this to work well, but things did not go as I expected. ‍",Software & Hardware,Lack of Funds,Pakistan,"March 17, 2018",Bilal Ahmad,https://www.failory.com/interview/quickhaggle,"['https://www.techmaish.com/introducing-quickhaggle-com-help-yourself-by-helping-others/', 'https://www.facebook.com/techmaish', 'https://www.twitter.com/techmaish']",failure,0,,"QuickHaggle was a community in which online users could exchange their skills.

193,rankd-seo," Hey! I’m a 30-year old entrepreneur from Latvia (Europe).As my day job, I work as the CEO of a large retail chain that sells alcoholic beverages. But my passion is online marketing.  Exactly one month ago, I launched my newest service called the Rankd SEO backlink database.  Rankd SEO is a unique approach to link-building. I don’t sell links and I don’t offer link-building services. What I do is that I offer step-by-step guides with images on how to create backlinks on hundreds of high-authority websites.  I’ve always liked the idea of a recurring revenue model and that’s why I made Rankd SEO in such a way. You must subscribe to our website to be able to access the database.  Even with our backlink guides, it would take days of non-stop work to build all backlinks in our database. And that’s only if you got one website. That’s why I think the model fits this website. I’m working on regularly expanding the database in order to have it so large that it wouldn’t be possible to build the links in a month. ‍",," The first month went by testing the link-building process. I tested to see how would the guides look and how long it takes to create each guide. I built more than a hundred backlinks before I felt sure that I could create a website and sell it as a service.  Also, I had to make sure that I have proof that the backlinks from my database give results. So, when I started building the database, I built the links for two of my newest sites.  It usually takes several months for backlinks to take an effect. At the moment of the launch, I had no real results to show. But lately, both of my sites saw a huge spike in traffic and reach. Here you can see the impact of the links to my sites. Stats are from Google Search Console. The first site was made in October 2018. The second one was made in August 2018. 1st site:  ‍ 2nd site:  ‍ Based on these results, I hope they’ll have a positive impact on sales.  Another challenge was building the website since there aren’t that many WordPress themes that support subscription-based model.  I didn’t want to spend too much on a website which I wasn’t sure was going to pay off. So, I bought a theme and had to work with it. Since I’m not a coder or a designer, I had a hard time adjusting the theme for my needs. I really don’t like building websites. It took me two weeks to make it decent. I’m sure for others it would take a day.  I’m not 100% satisfied with how the website looks now but it’s the best I can do with my skill set at the moment.   To be honest, I haven’t made any real mistakes yet as the service is only a bit more than a month old.  I’m trying to find a way on how to build the database larger as fast as I can. I’m thinking of finding a freelancer who could help me since I have lists of hundreds of sites to be made into guides. But they all take a lot of time to create.  Finding a reliable and smart assistant is my biggest concern now.  ‍",," With Rankd SEO I’d love to hit $5,000 revenue a month in the next 3 months. After that, my goal is to hit $10,000 mark a month. After that, the sky’s the limit.  Another goal is to be the largest backlink database on the internet. I want the database to consist of thousands of links with guides. In the next 6 months, I want my database to consist of 500+ guides (there are 240+ at the moment). I want Rankd SEO to be a long-term business that will bring money for years to come.  Maybe someday in the future, I will be able to sell the business for millions. Who knows? I want Rankd SEO to be one of many online income streams I have. In the following years, I want to leave my 9-5 in order to be able to travel the world and be a real digital nomad.  While my income right now is alright for some, I have high standards of living and I don’t feel ready yet to depend only on income from the internet. ‍",," Over the years, I had already compiled a list of websites where to build backlinks from but it was hard to remember how to build the links on each site since each site is different.  Since I launch new websites every now and then, I have to build new backlinks on a regular basis. Each time I struggle to remember how to build the link on a specific website.  So when the idea of the backlink database was born, I started documenting the process. First of all, I did it for myself in order to build backlinks faster for my future sites.  Even on the day of the public launch of the database, I had no idea whether people would seem to like the idea and would they pay for it.  I priced the service $34.99 a month, $59.99 for three months or $99.99 a year, all of which is subscription-based recurring revenue model. On the first day of launch, I already received a lot of questions about the database and I even had my first orders.  Here are the results after exactly one month after launching the service:  ‍ I’ve earned $2,364 in the first month.  And here are the results after 37 days since launch (at the moment of this interview): ‍ Now, the largest question I have is how many % of the subscribers will use the service for more than a month (recurring revenue). If I’ll be able to keep the customers to use my service for more than a month, then this service has a great future ahead.  That’s why I’m adding new guides on a regular basis to keep the interest high from new and current customers.",," The idea was born because I own several websites myself but I hate buying backlinks because you can never know what you’ll get and the links may penalize your site. Also, they cost a lot, and who wants to spend money, right? Building links on your own is a pain in the ass because it takes a lot of time and effort to build them. The publicly available backlink lists are outdated, broken, and most of the links don't work. What's most important - you don't get the instructions on what to do to build the link. I’ve never seen anyone doing it, that’s why I thought if I’m building the links myself, I might as well document the process and maybe make some money in the process.  Before I launched Rankd SEO, I already was earning from affiliate marketing and my own info-product sales. In 2018, I launched several info products which have been very successful. I’ve made more than $40,000 with two of my ebooks. I launched the first book in March 2018. It’s been selling now for a year, and while the sales are not as strong as in the beginning, they are still 4-figures a month.  Since the sales are starting to decline, I was looking for a new income source. That’s when an idea about Rankd SEO was born.  ‍", The business is too fresh to tell. I could’ve made the database larger for the launch but it seems that people are ready to pay for the number of guides I have already.  I launched the service with 200 guides. Would it pay off more if there would be 300 or 500 guides? I don’t know. What if the service wouldn’t sell at all? Then I would have wasted my valuable time. With 200 guides I felt confident to start selling the service at the price point it is now. ‍," I already had a good experience with some SEO forums so I made sales threads on a few forums.  One, in particular, is responsible for 70% of all sales.  From the first day, I already received plenty of traffic and sales. Another source is Reddit. I LOVE Reddit. I’ve been using it since 2016 to promote products & services. I’ve even written an eBook about getting traffic from Reddit. ‍", I own a personal online marketing blog called Mr. Web Capitalist. Some of the case studies are very unique as I talk about my success and failures in online marketing. ," My two favorite blogs are Backlinko by Brian Dean and Matthew Woodward’s blog. I believe both sites have the most comprehensive articles about SEO and online marketing in general.  Also, I highly recommend watching anything from the motivational speaker Jim Rohn. Once I stumbled upon one of his videos on YouTube, and the way he talks and his advice changed my view on life.  Also, forums are a great place to learn new techniques and maybe some less known tips or cool case studies. My favorite forum is Black Hat World.

194,raw-gains," My name is Jack Ellis. I’m the co-founder of Fathom Analytics, the privacy-first alternative to Google Analytics. We’ve been running this company for a few years now and I quit my job in 2020 to work on it full time. I’m originally from the United Kingdom, but I now live in Canada with my wife & daughter. Back in 2013, I left my full-time job to pursue my startup called Raw Gains, which ultimately failed. It was going to be similar to MyFitnessPal but completely focused on bodybuilding & coaching. It was self-funded and I worked alone on the project. I was 20 years old at the time and thought I knew everything. I had such a vision for it. The software would allow you to cycle your calories, plan macronutrients, workouts, and also give access to your coach. At the time, the market was full of tools that were doing this, but they were all quite awful, and I was going after a specific niche.  We would make money by charging for the service and off of affiliate revenue. Fun story, I actually exchanged emails with the founder of Gymshark about partnering up to sell some of their stuff. This was before Gymshark was a billion-dollar company. "," It went bad from the start, I just didn’t know it. The launch was meaningless because I thought people would “just turn up”. I knew nothing about building an audience/business, and this was a humbling, depressing lesson for me. I had no real clue how to market, and all I’d done was spend money on Facebook adverts to grow a mailing list.",,,,," Going live took over a year. I would obsess about details and get hung up for weeks. The biggest obstacle when building software is getting hung up on irrelevant details. You need to move fast and come up with a system to break out of circular thinking. Also, set aside time for planning, but don’t try to plan everything at once. Plan one thing, then execute, then repeat. If you try to plan everything, you’ll run into problems. You won’t know everything at the start of your project, so stop trying to plan the whole thing out. The only time people should be trying to plan everything is when you’re hiring an external team, and they need a spec. The lack of external accountability led to poor time management. And quite honestly, I didn’t want to work with anyone. I always thought it would be bad to partner up because a) you gave up 50% of control and b) you’d need to make so much more money for both of you to earn a good income. This viewpoint was one of my stupidest, most dangerous business opinions, and that held me back for a long time. ‍",," My background is in software development. I have worked with web development languages, such as PHP since I was 13. I invested a lot of my free time in honing my skill-set, building non-commercial software, and that gave me a solid development foundation. This allowed me to get a part-time job in college and be offered an agency job immediately after. However, I always knew I wanted to start my own company. I’d started multiple “business” ventures since I was a kid, including selling sweets, washing cars, and offering web hosting. But Raw Gains came out of an interest I had in weightlifting. I found that I wasn’t happy with the available tools on the market, and I knew there were others like me who weren’t happy either. So the story of the Raw Gains idea is that I merged my passions (tech & fitness), and concluded that I was going to leave my job and start a business. Ironically, because I was working so hard on Raw Gains, I actually let my fitness fall to the side, but that’s another story."," Firstly, when you’re attempting to do something realistic, I believe failure occurs only when you give up or it becomes impossible to do so. If I was to start Raw Gains up again now, I’d succeed, and I’d try to loop my Fathom co-founder into it because we work really well together.

As a complete newcomer in the industry, we ran into several unexpected obstacles and challenges.  There were financial constraints and the worst part was that we didn’t have a mentor or a good team or great experience or a fail-safe business plan to survive in this industry. We have had plenty of bad days, but what always kept us going was a strong belief in ourselves and our idea. There was a lot of struggles to find the right resources, a team with enough pool of employees and mostly, align our offerings to our customers’ interests. Despite anything, we have focused on a detail-oriented approach with top quality offerings and economic pricing right from the beginning. That’s what absolutely resonates with our end users and throughout made us a highly recommended choice among our customers.  In fact, it’s thanks to our genuine efforts and unwavering determination that we have now come a long way. However, I think tackling challenges is something ongoing and unstoppable as the industry is ever evolving, bringing in many uncertainties every now and then. You should be therefore always prepared to confront improbable situations and devise innovative solutions which effectively respond to the most difficult of problems.  ‍  We have made lots of mistakes in the process of building Rayna Tours, but especially these were what encouraged us to move forward with confidence. In fact, every failure has given us only a valuable lesson. So I believe that there is nothing as mistakes. I would rather refer to them as experiments which turn you away from repeating the same folly again. So don’t be afraid to commit mistakes or more precisely experiment with your thoughts and ideas.

This proved to be highly innovative (at that time) and we began to get an amazing response which enticed us to open seven more outlets in two years. And by 2009, we had established ourselves as a full-service Destination Management Company with our main office in Old Labour Building, Abu Hail Dubai. Ten years later, it’s gratifying to see everything in place. We’re now active in both B2C and B2B verticals, besides our successful presence in close to 10 countries.",," Before starting Rayna Tours, I worked with Safeer Group of Companies. And later, at Time Machine Group of Companies, where I was promoted to the more responsible position as Marketing Head. After almost seven years into my professional career, I decided to explore an unchartered territory. That is when I began to deeply think about the possibilities of launching Rayna Tours in 2006. My love for travel, curiosity to discover exotic cultures, and my passion to reach out to more and more people, were the main reasons that inspired me to take up this huge risk. And no sooner, I and Kamlesh were onboard to taste the challenges, difficulties and obviously the success of entrepreneurship.  ‍"," Well, this is strange but I genuinely don’t want to change anything about my business journey. As I told earlier, we had to face so many struggles in different phases of setting up Rayna Tours and Travels. And what’s amazing is that all of them had only made us wiser and better people. In fact, I am deeply grateful to this incredible entrepreneurial journey which has helped us to bring the best out of us.  ‍"," We thought about tons of them. Some turned out to be lucrative and some others were unsuccessful. One of our major marketing strategies has been to invest in our own desert camp plus an extensive fleet of luxury vehicles, yachts, dhows etc. This has allowed us to guarantee the best rates in the industry for the majority of our services such as desert safaris to limo tours, transfers and dhow cruises. Another great strategy was to get into the online world Our website is now one of the largest all-inclusive platforms on the web to compare, select and book a vast spectrum of tours and holiday packages in a few easy steps.  We are really active on almost all social media platforms where we share our latest news, promotions, product launches, etc. We’ve also launched a user-friendly app for the convenience of our guests. More importantly, we have introduced several innovative programs in order to better serve and give back to our community of agents and travel operators, such as R Points. There is a dedicated technical team in order to ensure the unprecedented efficiency and top performance of all our online services. Besides our high-end technological solutions, we focus on traditional marketing techniques as well, such as printed ads, phone calls, face to face meetings, and direct emails. ‍"," You can visit our website and RaynaB2B website to know more about our products and services. Along with detailed product and services information, you’ll also come across exciting discount codes which you can apply for instant savings on your favorite tours and holiday packages.

196,readership," Hey, Rich! So I’m based in Utah where I live with my wife and two young kids. My background is marketing, but I’ve worked on small teams most of my career so I’ve learned to wear a lot of hats. Some of those hats were the usual suspects, but I spent more time than I expected designing websites and collateral and writing code.  Along the way I realized that my design and development skills were becoming something better than terrible, so I started building more and more tools and apps. Readership was one of those products. It sat alongside a couple other products me and my business partner Patrick were working on. Right now, my main focus is a platform called SendView. The gist is that instead of marketers joining newsletters with their personal address, SendView creates custom tracking addresses they can use instead that analyze all the emails sent to them and breaks them down into dashboards and analytics. "," In a sentence: Readership was a really cool tool with very little real-world value. I should have heeded the warning signs I saw early on, but I was a bit blinded by how much fun it was to build and the time I’d already spent on it.  I mentioned earlier how many PR folks I reached out to. I had this theory early on that if I could build a product they could resell to their clients, I could have a really clear market to work with and not have to spend as much time on marketing. The problem was that every time I talked to these people, they didn’t get it. I’d send them a sample report, and they’d say, “okaaayy, soooo…” I literally was teaching them what I would do with it if I were in their shoes. Except they were the experts. I wasn’t. Their responses should have stopped me dead in my tracks. But I loved this product, so I kept pushing forward because it was almost done. Eventually I launched, got a ton of users requesting a free sample report and…well, I think you can guess the result. Hundreds of sample reports, not a single paid upgrade to a full report or second report. Everyone was saying, “wow, this is cool...but...um...what do I do with it exactly?” Readership never solved a problem. It never provided tangible value. It was just, well, cool to look at. "," My biggest mistake, by far, was throwing good time after bad even though the market was telling me there was no demand for my product. I was doing a lot of things right - researching the market, talking to lots of people, getting the POC in front of the audience I hoped would buy, asking hard questions - but I simply didn’t internalize what they were telling me. I could have saved myself months of work if I would have just opened my eyes to the reality of Readership’s potential during those early conversations with potential users.",,,," Readership was built purely on the free, public Twitter API endpoints available to virtually any developer. It was one of the more fun products I’ve ever built. It carried some unique challenges as I scaled. For example, it only took me a few minutes to store 20,000 or 25,000 links some company’s audience had interacted with. But those were shortened links so I couldn’t see the domain. Building a really fast link expander and then cranking all those links through took me a surprisingly long time to dial. The reporting interface itself was built with a UI kit I made for myself a few years back, so it actually came together pretty quickly. I’m not sure why, but it’s still one of my favorite visual reports. The pricing model was fairly straightforward. Each report cost $99, but the results contained no branding so they could be resold or white labeled. Again, that speaks to our theory that PR pros would be reselling this to their clients. Based on conversations and experience with PR teams, we expected they could be resold for anywhere from $250 - $500 on the low end.",," The idea for Readership came somewhat slowly. I’ve always loved the Twitter API. It’s completely amazing. It’s like being a fly on the wall of any conversation happening at any time all over the world. And I’ve always loved experimenting with what I could do with the data. For example, I once built an app that could monitor weather in real-time just by watching for people tweeting stuff like “hey, it’s snowing,” What a time to be alive. Readership started as one of those experiments. I was playing with two things - expanding short URLs and extracting domain names from those URLs. I was using my own profile to do this and as I went along I started to notice funny patterns in my behavior. I’m a snowboarder, and I was favoriting a lot of tweets with links to snow-related stuff. Same with parenting. With two little ones, I chuckled at how many things I was favoriting or retweeting or sharing relating to raising kids. Slowly, I realized that I could do the same thing for any account and the potential insights that could glean eventually became the genesis for Readership. ‍"," Honestly, not much in the early phases. I really did do a lot of stuff right. I still would have built a prototype, I still would have reached out to a ton of people, I still would have gotten it to the “almost working” stage. What I would have done differently is simply listen to the audience more and be more honest with myself about what they were saying. Interestingly, this lesson has already served us well. Around the same time as Readership, we were also launching a platform called Hemlock that lets marketers visualize other companies content calendars. In Hemlock’s case, people were actually paying for it. But within months of launch our churn was through the roof. Nothing we did seemed to help. But Patrick was really diligent at following up with each cancellation and talking with them about why they left. In every case, people said, “Well, I loved the tool, but I got everything I needed from it within the first month or so. I just don’t need it anymore.”  No matter what features we added, we kept hearing this story. Granted, it’s after people pay us something, but we need 6-12 months from a user for it to work, not 1-2. So we’re having those hard conversations about “do we keep going and try to fix this or cut our losses and focus elsewhere?” It’s tough to let go of something you’ve worked so hard on, but knowing we made the right call with Readership helps us have a bit more confidence in that regard. That’s part of the reason we’re really focusing on SendView right now. The market loves it, they’ll pay for it, we love what it does for our own marketing efforts and, most importantly, users stick around for 10 times longer than with Hemlock. There’s a lot of debate around whether you should just focus on one product or put a few eggs in the basket. In our case, we started with a few but are slowly honing in on one because the lessons that prevent the others from scaling. ‍"," I did a lot of research and one-on-one outreach for Readership, but it was still very much a side project. I think I ended up talking to probably 10-15 PR professionals before I launched, and then continued that outreach after. I rolled out to our database of ~2,000 subscribers plus the usual suspects including a PR push, Betalist, Product Hunt, etc. I’ll get to this more later, but the launch itself showed me I was on the wrong path so marketing didn’t extend much further beyond that. "," You can actually still see the old sales page for Readership here, but you can learn more about this and our platforms at Peakfeed."," Right now, I’m really big on the deep, raw dives into other entrepreneurs’ stories. I think my favorite at the moment is Build Your SaaS, the podcast by Justin Jackson and Jon Buda about their efforts to build Transistor.fm. It’s deep, it’s real, it’s not just a superficial view of the highs and lows but all the nitty gritty in between. It helps give context to the stuff we usually tend to hear about in podcasts and conference talks. Aside from that I’m also reading a lot of books about building products and running businesses in general. One I’ve really liked is called Traction, by Gino Wickman. It’s a simple, reliable framework for organizing a small business and getting work done. We’re too small to need all of it, but it’s got a lot of really good stuff. Same with Shape Up by Basecamp. Some doesn’t make sense for us, but stuff like how they make bets is something we’ve started to apply to our monthly planning meetings to compliment our own ideas. I also try to jump on the phone with other founders or product people on a regular basis and just talk. There are few better ways to spend 20 minutes than jamming on challenges and successes with people who are on a similar path. "," Luckily, the only thing I lost was time. At one point I explored using the GNIP API to get access to the full, expanded URLs right up front. And I also got approved to use the Pipl API so I could analyze an email list instead of just a Twitter audience. But as I slowly faced the facts, I shelved both of those plans and cut my losses. Losses that, again, were just time (but quite a bit of it, I’m afraid to admit). If I had to add it up, I probably spend 100+ hours on this tool, which was a ton for something that was very much classified as a side hustle. A hundred hours is a lot of evenings and weekends. ‍",Analytics,No Market Need,United States,"October 3, 2019",Gregg Blanchard,https://www.failory.com/interview/readership,"['https://peakfeed.com/readership', 'http://peakfeed.com']",failure,0,,"Gregg Blanchard developed Readership from a fascination with Twitter API.

197,reality-hunt," I've been doing video games, websites, and apps for the better part of about 10-15 years now. I'm currently the Chief Product Officer at a mobility company called Skipr in Belgium. But I spent a lot of my time building side projects to grow, learn different tools, and build out different ideas. I do that under the umbrella of a company called Startup Mill and the idea behind it is to build out little ventures, see if they scale up, and grow into a business. If they do, then they get spun off. Very similar to a venture builder or startup builder, but built them by myself. ‍"," The driving KPI that showed progress at ""I Voted Remain"" was sales. But that is backed up by the number of visitors to the site and other TOFU (top of the funnel) metrics. As Brexit became more and more prominent, the will of someone buying a T-shirt saying ""I had voted Remain"" was slowing down quite fast. “Now that I'm more experienced, I would track a lot harder each project KPI's to understand its current status.” An overall lack of growth was one indicator that RealityHunt was not doing well. The number of visits wasn't that high. I think one of the key things was timing. That's why I still think the problem is present today. The number of people that had headsets or the number of people that were in the space of AR/VR was a lot lower than what is needed to create a community like Product Hunt. ‍  After a while, there was a low number of sales and lots of roadblocks in terms of advertising for politics. You had to pay a lot in terms of cost per click (CPC) and cost per thousand views (CPM). In the end, the project was very much a test. I was okay to shut it down and today it's in a zombie state. I don't put any effort into it because I started looking at other projects. My learnings from that project helped me build new projects.",,,,,," Getting the site up and running for ""I Voted Remain"" was quite easy. The rest of it was marketing. The challenge was that once you do political t-shirts, marketing becomes a lot more difficult because advertising is seen as political. This was probably one of my first forays into AdWords and Facebook Ads. The advertising rules and regulations, tools, and political lines are quite challenging. You're in a niche because you're talking about Brexit. It was a nightmare to do online advertising. The key levers for growing RealityHunt were very much acquiring users because it's a dual-sided market. I needed those users to be adding different types of projects and resources to the website and build-out that community space. That was a challenge because the website didn't work that well. I didn't have the whole user management and upvoting system in place properly. It never really took off. But at some point, I'll probably restart it again. ‍"," I started a project called ""I Voted Remain"". As you can probably tell from the name, it was linked to Brexit. I'm Belgian and English and I was against Brexit for reasons that are obvious to the fact that I'm very European. I wanted a way of showing that, so I thought the T-shirt business would be an interesting way of doing it. I started a little adventure to understand how dropshipping worked and how I could get an e-commerce platform up and running. I started selling a T-shirt that said ""I had voted Remain"" so that you could wear it loud and proud. But I didn't want to have any stock. I didn't want to have any assets to worry about. That's why I went the whole dropshipping route. I built it with Shopify for the first 30 days and I found it too expensive. After that, I went down the PrestaShop route and that was way too complicated. PrestaShop is a solution that allows you to do an e-commerce platform, but it's open-source, you can install it. It's good, but it takes a lot of time to customize. If you want to get into anything decent you have to spend time customizing the themes. That was such a time suck. ‍  I was looking for a way to reproduce Product Hunt for the AR and VR space. The idea was to create a platform to discover different tools and apps in this space. I still think the problem exists. I used a full code solution that built a Product Hunt clone. You had to host it on your server and code up all the pages and everything to work. I thought it was a lot closer to what I wanted RealityHunt to be. There was a very steep learning curve in terms of coding and getting the result at the time I wanted."," If I was just to do a dropshipping business, I would not do it in anything political. That's for sure. I still think that niche is good. Because going niche means you have a more defined audience. Once you have that audience defined, it's a lot easier. “I'd go a lot heavier on the marketing, especially in terms of just building out that community by email and automating a lot of processes.” In terms of RealityHunt, my approach would be using no-code tools. Building it with Webflow and Integromat and put it all together. I would try and build a list of people that are interested in the project to validate my hypothesis first. Build a landing page stating I'm going to build this and if you're interested sign-up. When you hit a certain KPI, which could be 100 users or 50 signups, that becomes the trigger to fully build it. I'm applying that process to a different set of projects I'm working on right now. Just to see if people are interested. If I get people behind it and they're already interested, it makes sense to go ahead and try those projects out. ‍  Build processes that simplify your way of working. For example, I have a Notion template. Whenever I have a new project, I just click on one button, and my Notion page for that project is set up. I have all my finance structure, my key development links, my API key page, and everything already prepared. It saves me a bunch of time. “Build a simple landing page and just test out your idea on paper before you commit to building it. That will save a lot of time.” Don't be afraid to get feedback. Just talk to users and figure out what they want instead of what you have in your head. The product development side of getting feedback is not about the best solution you have in your mind. It's about what the customer wants. If they want to have a bit more of this and a bit more of that then go ahead and build it. ‍",, Here’s my personal website.You can also find me on Twitter and LinkedIn.," I'm a big fan of Twitter. Not for the platform itself, but the community built around entrepreneurs, people with companies, people with ideas, and the no-code scene. Those communities are huge on Twitter, with lots of great people chatting. They're great resources and I highly advise people to make a list of makers so that you can curate your feed, I get the best out of it. Once you curate your feed, you'll get a lot of value. I use Slack groups to be able to talk to different communities. These are defined audiences. These are people that are actively involved in the topics that they joined. If you are going to push or test an idea, these people will reply because they're passionate already. Some people like Reddit as a way of doing that. I just happen to like Slack. Get as many books as you can through Audible. I do a lot of working and listening. I just go through the books on Audible because it works for me, but some people need to have physical books, other people will just watch videos. Find whatever you need to learn, and then double down on that. Podcasts are amazing. The Indie Hackers podcast and Courtland Allen are top-notch. Find the podcasts that are good for you. Syntax.fm is really good for web development. A good way of finding information that you need at that moment is to use Spotify and type in into the podcast section ""Webflow"", ""dropshipping"", ""getting acquired"", ""hiring people"", or ""finding co-founder"". You'll end up with a ton of episodes of different podcasts that will be centered on that topic. The moment you tap, you'll be able to jump from one podcast to another and the learning will accelerate fast. That's how I find podcasts that work for me. ‍"," I sold about 10 ""I Voted Remain"" T-shirts, which we're selling for 20£ so in total about 200£ or a bit less once all the fees were taken out. In terms of profit, I made about 70£. Not worth the amount of effort it was needed in terms of marketing or in terms of being able to continue with the project. The advertising costs would massively outweigh any benefit that you would make out of that project. The costs to build RealityHunt were a lot higher because I took on a coder to help build out aspects of what didn't work as expected. I invested around 1,000/2,000€ into that project. That's why I'm still holding on to it because I think the idea is fine but the execution was poor. By doing lots of no-code projects I've developed different skills. Now that I've skilled up, I'll have another shot at it and see if I can get it off the ground. ‍",Software & Hardware,No Market Need,Belgium,"March 16, 2021",Toby Allen,https://www.failory.com/interview/reality-hunt,"['http://www.tobyallen.com/', 'https://twitter.com/tobyallen007', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobyallen']",failure,0,,"Toby founded two projects that gave him lots of valuable lessons for his current Startup Mill projects.

198,refolo,"  Hello! I’m Lola and I’m in my 20s based in Atlanta. I currently run a digital product studio called Lunch Pail Labs and Refolo was my very first product and foray into entrepreneurship. It was a meal-planning application that focused on plant-based eating. I built it myself and was responsible for all of it, product, marketing, customer support.  The business model was simple, pay a monthly subscription ($15 a month) for customizable plant-based recipes that reminded you of home. The recipes were shoppable as well so you could get the ingredients delivered through delivery services like Instacart, Amazon Prime, etc. "," Ha! I don’t think it ever really went in the right direction. There was a lot of fake traction (getting into an entrepreneurship program here, collaboration with X group there) but at the core, I didn’t have a repeatable process for finding people who wanted to pay for the product. I also was trying to sell a product where people could find a lot of the information they needed for free and in a lot of cases were fine with what they could find for free.It’s a lesson, I’ve taken to new things that I’ve built. Finding where people are already paying and improving on that solution can be much easier to monetize.  There wasn’t one specific event that made me decide to shut it down. Some causes were poor maker/problem fit, trying to make it a thing too early and not experimenting, and selling a solution for a problem that people weren't already investing money to solve. 6 months before I shut it down, I left my job to put more energy into Refolo, and given that it wasn’t making any money and didn’t have any promising signs of traction, it didn’t make sense to continue. ‍",,,,," I started working on the product while I was taking a UX design class part-time and I used it as my final project for the class and conducted my initial user interviews. From there it was a slow iterative process of trying different things and finding people to talk to. For a while, I was working on an iPhone app with Swift but the first functional MVP was a coda doc, then I upgraded to a WordPress site with some plugins and then made a Bubble app. ‍", I held a meetup for plant-based eaters in Atlanta. It grew to a little over 100 members and was a source of initial testers. I also cross-promoted and held virtual events with plant-based influencers on Instagram. It was fine to get people to sign up but didn’t attract any paying users.‍ ‍, My background is unrelated to food. I studied math and engineering in college and while working on Refolo I was managing teams at an eCommerce company. The idea for the company came after my dad was diagnosed with cancer and had to drastically change his diet. He began to develop sensitivities to some of his favorite recipes and figuring out what to eat became a struggle. I thought there had to be a better way to figure it out so I started working on Refolo.," Invest in growing a community around the problem first and then figure out what products are needed. I went in with a ton of assumptions based on my experience of one person (my dad!) and didn’t do a great job getting into the community to see how people were solving the problem. I’d also try many small experiments in the space instead of focusing on one approach, to begin with. It took a year from when I first had the idea to when I had something people could use. Because of the long-time investment in one vision of the product, I was so attached to the path. ",, Sure! You can learn more about me at lola.fyi and I’m on Twitter @ojabowalola.

199,reform," My name is Peter. I’m 31 years old, married, and dad to a 1-year old. I’m based out of Copenhagen, Denmark, but I’m about to move to a small 8,000 people town an hour away from Copenhagen. Reform is my and my cofounder’s take on designing and building a simple, clean-looking form builder that we felt the market was missing. I’m the CEO, and while I write code from time to time, and mainly on the backend, I spend most of my time on marketing, customer success, and admin stuff. My cofounder, Bjørn, runs the product and writes most of the code. It’s a traditional SaaS-based model where we charge a monthly subscription fee (currently $19) from our customers. ‍",," The hardest part was the pivot away from Branch. First of all, the way you try to make a startup work is by giving it all you can. After doing that for two years and realizing it won’t work, it is really hard to find the energy to do it all again. Second of all, because the business was revenue-generating (especially WP Pusher) and had hundreds of customers, you suddenly have 2 companies you run. Running the WP Pusher/Branch sales process on nights and weekends was also very hard. ",," We recently crossed the 100 customer milestone, which I’m really proud of. We went from idea to 100 customers in something like 8 months. It’s still just my co-founder and me, and we hope that Reform will be able to support both of us before the end of 2022. The most important thing for both of us is that Reform provides the flexibility to have the lifestyle we desire. Like, go live in another country for an extended period. ",," The form builder space was already validated, but I knew it was highly competitive. So what I needed to figure out was if: People wanted the kind of form builder we wanted to makeWe were able to find the distribution we needed in such a crowded space (still to be determined) The first thing we did was talk to many people who were already using a competing product. I read the Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick a few times and tried to follow his advice as much as possible. After my conversations, I still felt like there was something for us to explore in this space. The next thing we did was build a landing page for our yet-to-be-built form builder, now called Reform. We put in an entire month’s work because we knew the page had to be good to stand out truly. We also designed some mockups in Figma of how we wanted the forms to look. We used the mockups on the landing page and also made a hard-coded version of one of them and used that as our early access signup. This worked great because it also served as a simple demo of what we planned to build. The landing page was designed in Figma, so it was really easy to invite people to give us feedback and comment directly on the page. We probably asked 20-30 people for feedback, and in the end, the copy and design were really solid. When I felt confident enough to share the landing page with everyone, I tweeted it out and asked everyone I knew to help amplify it. It worked, and the tweet got more than 100,000 impressions, and we got 500 signups on the first day. When we finally launched, we had 1,300. Because the tweet did so well, we decided to invest a couple of months to build the product. In a few weeks, we were able to replace our early access signup with an actual Reform form, and after about a month, we brought on the first early access customer. We kept onboarding people for a couple of months until we had about 40 paying customers. We then officially launched on Twitter and opened up access to everyone. ",," I did the whole nomadic thing in my twenties and didn’t have a permanent home base from 2013 until 2017 when I moved to Scotland to live with my then girlfriend. During that time, I roamed around in Southern Europe and Southeast Asia. I also spent a semester at a university in Morocco. While traveling, I worked as a freelance developer and later started my own WordPress plugin business with a product called WP Pusher. After running WP Pusher on the side for a few years, I started a SaaS in the WordPress space called Branch. I joined the first batch of the TinySeed accelerator and raised a bit of money from some angel investors. The very short version is that Branch ultimately didn’t work out while still having a substantial runway + revenue from WP Pusher. With the runway, I decided to find a new idea and the first idea required me to find a form builder I liked. While researching different form builders, I realized that I didn’t like any of them, and when I talked to my startup friends about it, they felt the same way. I asked the developer I had brought on to work on Branch if he wanted to explore this idea with me as a co-founder, and he said yes. I recently sold both WP Pusher and Branch to extend our runway further.", Marketing works when you put in the work - and a lot of developer founders don’t. ," The number one marketing strategy we used was Reform’s early prototype as our early access signup form (described above). The second one was launching on Product Hunt and putting in the work. I knew Reform was the kind of product that could do well on Product Hunt, but you never know who ends up launching the same day as you. We decided to invest 2-3 weeks into the launch and go after the first place. We ended up becoming the number one product of both the day and the week, which was pretty awesome. We followed the playbook that Corey Haines and Derrick Reimer have laid out online (Derrick did a talk at MicroConf Remote, which is available for free). The key is to wait until you have enough happy customers that can share a review and help you spread the word. I think many people launch on Product Hunt too early."," You can check my Twitter profile and my podcast, Out of Beta, where we regularly share resources like these.", Books: The Mom Test by Rob FitzpatrickObviously Awesome by April DunfordDeploy Empathy by Michele Hansen Talks: Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business by Jason Cohen Podcast episodes: How to Plan an MVP by Michael SeibelBreaking through SaaS PlateausJTBD at Intercom: Des Traynor on Jobs-to-be-Done Radio Articles: Product-User Fit Comes Before Product-Market Fit ,,Software & Hardware,,Denmark,"December 14, 2021",Peter Suhm,https://www.failory.com/interview/reform,"['https://twitter.com/petersuhm', 'https://www.outofbeta.fm']",success,1,$0-$10k/mo,"Peter co-founded Reform, a simple, clean-looking form builder that they felt the market was missing.

200,refrens,"  Hi! I am Naman, co-founder of Refrens.com, an operating system for Freelancers and agencies. I'm a 32 years old entrepreneur, based out of Bangalore, India. Refrens is a B2B marketplace to generate more leads. At the same time, Refrens helps to manage backend work with various free tools like invoicing, expense management, and many more.  Mainly, I look after the fundraising by pitching to various investors for this 2 years old startup that is now scaling up quickly. Also, I am the product and marketing manager at Refrens. This means that I lead the teams to build and grow the platform by focusing on various aspects including marketing, PR, and designing.   I am responsible for ensuring that Refrens keeps up with customer expectations. Therefore, I look after adding/amending various features on the platform, to make it more user-friendly and to keep up with the latest technology trends.   Our business model is simply matching the demand supply in the freelance market and charging a fee-for-service. At Refrens, we are building India’s most powerful platform for finances and growth. ‍",,"  The initial challenge in any startup is to get the first set of users. We faced this challenge at Refrens also. We entered a crowded market with some of the players being at a very mature stage. Getting the first few users was the key. We called a lot of prospects and handheld them to lift their data from their existing platform to Refrens.  We were relying on growth through the marketing of the product. Although the product is free, as mentioned, our target audience is used to getting an in-person demo and extensive hand-holding for initial adoption. We solved this through better design. Instead of designing like a traditional invoicing system, we started with the assumption that our audience has never used an invoicing system before. This helped us win a lot of new customers.   I believe we are still evolving, every single day. I have a great team that is very agile and due to this, we can iterate fast to match our user’s expectations. ‍",," We have more than 100K freelancers, agencies, and small businesses signed up on our platform to date. We are seeing a monthly average growth of 15%. This number will rise as we roll out more features.  We are targeting a million users over the next 2 years from India. Post that we will like to expand to the US, Europe, and South Asia. In parallel, we are also working on other complementary products that make the life of a freelancer or agency owner easy and empower them for further growth.",," After scrutinizing industry reports on the market size and the tools used by freelancers and other professionals for payments. We launched a raw product in a closed group. With the feedback received, we started improvising on the product.  While there were a host of invoicing platforms, most of them had a limited free period. That was not all, payment collection was a major challenge since it required a lot of follow-ups and reminders. This was the major trigger to create a system around it and hence Refrens.com was born. Our initial product wasn’t well-received by the audience. It called for an excessive change in user habits. After incorporating the responses received by some freelancers in the product's second iteration, our offering was quick in getting accepted by the freelancing community. People found the tool simple and slick. Freelancers or small agencies can sign up on our platform by providing the necessary details. They can create unlimited free invoices, quotations, and proforma invoices with a very easy-to-use design. Most of the details are auto-filled and the user just has to modify them at their convenience. There are no watermarks and users can use their branding. They can embed our payment gateway in the invoice itself which makes making payments (by the client) super easy. As we progressed, we came across other challenges freelancers and small agencies were facing like no easy access to loans or credits which made us create unique features like Early Pay Discounts to shorten cash cycles. The company's core segment revolves around B2B freelancers. The vision is to create an ecosystem for freelancers which helps them to solve their day-to-day issues, generate more work and build a network around it. ‍ The Refrens team strongly believes in freelancing as the future of work. As a result, this domain needs significant enhancements and advancements to be successful. ‍",,"  In 2009, I did my engineering in Computer science. While everyone was joining the campus offers from service companies in India, I decided to take a different path.   I joined Freecharge, as their first Product Manager. At an early age, I lead both the Technology and Marketing teams at Freecharge. I worked from scratch to build its first 100k users.   Post-Freecharge, I joined ZipDial, again I was the first PM here. We built the product from scratch. This was an idea which I had independently conceptualized at college. I started as a Product Manager at ZipDial moving to Enterprise sales and into Marketing in my final months. ZipDial was acquired by Twitter.  I had the entrepreneurial quest in me from the beginning. That is one of the main reasons why I did not join a service company right out of college, which most students do. Even though I worked as an employee at Freecharge and ZipDial, being among the early hires gave me the entrepreneurial freedom to build great products.   These experiences were a good learning experience and motivated me to take a plunge into entrepreneurship. After ZipDial, I ventured into my own and founded FindYogi.com. We focused on consumer electronics and built a profitable business with over 2M monthly users.  I met a lot of good freelancers during my course of growing multiple startups but finding them and interacting with them was tough. It looked like a good market to solve problems for. After consulting a lot of established startups, in 2018, I started working on my second and current venture Refrens.com.  Refrens was launched to solve the delay and inefficiency freelancers face when collecting payments from different customers. It is possible to create an invoice within 30 seconds on Refrens. We are trying to build a system around invoicing, not limiting the platform to just invoice creation which by the way is free forever. One can generate quotations/proforma invoices, track expenses, generate TDS/GST Reports.   Along with an invoicing and payments service provider, Refrens is also a marketplace, designed for B2B service providers including designers, software developers, accountants, marketers, consultants, etc. Our focus is on the growth of individual freelancers and agencies."," Pick up a large market that you understand. Solve a problem where you know who the user is. Solve hard problems for the long run. Assume your user to be a layman. If you can acquire the most layman-ish user, you have made an easy-to-adopt, useful product. And if it is useful and easy to adopt, it will gain traction. Listening to your user. While building a product it is very important to remove our personal bias and focus on what the user wants. Being agile to make quick changes. Being consistent in your efforts. Keep ‘execution’ as your business Mantra. I believe execution is the Holy Grail and the most underrated part of a business. A lot of companies do better than their counterparts just because they execute well. The most important lesson learned as a person is to surround yourself with the kind of people you want to be. If you surround yourself with hardworking and successful people, you become one. ‍"," We created a USP by focusing on the ability to capture the client-vendor relationship which allows businesses to network among themselves to generate qualified leads.  We use multiple techniques to market our products and create awareness. We use SEO, SEM, Social Media, Content Marketing, Email based retargeting to reach our customers.  We heavily rely on SEO and advertisements to get traffic to the website. For us, social media platforms were not effective to increase the customer base. We have tried a couple of hacks around Facebook groups and pages but weren't successful in driving mass attention. We are now focusing on other platforms like LinkedIn, Quora, Instagram, and Pinterest for brand building and awareness. Apart from that, we are interviewing various prominent freelancers in the Indian market to increase our reach. Along with that, we are focusing on link-building strategies like guest blogging to get higher search engine rankings.

201,rent-nest," Hey! My name is Steven Glod, I’m 34 years old and I’m based in Berlin. I’m currently the Head of International of Machinio, the company I co-owned for a long time and recently sold for $25M. I wasn’t the founder, but the 1st employee I then became one of the owners 6 months after joining. Just prior to Machinio, I co-founded Rent Nest, the “Evernote for rental business”. It was an app that allowed users to save, share, and collect information of houses from websites like Craigslist, PadMapper, and Zillow, and then share this information with other people, write comments on it, etc. The business model consisted on collecting a (low) commission if we effectively connected the renter with the property owner. We ran the business for 2 years. Throughout this journey, we participated in an accelerator, built a small team, grew to $12k/mo, and eventually ran out of money and shut down. ‍"," We ran Rent Nest for 2 years. The lack of money for a long time and some issues with my partner were the reasons that made us realize things weren’t going well. We had a third partner who participated in the accelerator process for one month but he wasn’t full time into the Rent Nest. He was an accountant and was sort of helping. Long story short, we didn't get along well and we couldn’t resolve some issues, which made us decide to go on separate ways. At the same time, I think we didn't trust each other enough we weren’t comfortable with letting the other person take full control of tasks. That made us spread too thin and not focus on one thing. I think it was a good product and we did get good feedback. I honestly believe there’s space for a company to be successful in the space. At that time, no one was trying to solve the issue in the way we did, though not sure if there isn’t any app doing it currently. The accelerator was not pleased when we decided to shut down. They thought we kind of gave off which I would say we actually did. We didn't have any money and we started to focus on other things. I, for example, joined Machinio one month before we took the final decision to cease operations. It was a great opportunity in which I’d work with someone who was smarter than me and I could learn a lot from, so I made a personal and economical decision to move on. "," I think we were too conservative with money. We would spend a little bit of money on a lot of things rather than more money on one thing and make sure that it would work. That's definitely something I learned in my current startup you want to be frugal but you also want to make sure that you can accept or deny the hypothesis you have 100%. As for disadvantages, the cultural difference was one. Note there were 8 hours of differences between us and the dev team.",,,," I do not have any technical knowledge and nor did my partner at the time, so we decided to join an accelerator.  We got into one called Digital Catalyst Tech Accelerator based in Bucharest, Romania, so we moved for 4 months to that city. The accelerator had an in-house technical team that essentially built our product this was one of the reasons why we chose them. The whole process of building the product took 5.5 months and I’d describe as quite frustrating. It was the first time I had ever been to Europe and first time really going outside of the country, which made it even harder. Working with people from Eastern Europe was very much of a different experience from a cultural standpoint. One of the things I learned the most from that experience is how important is project management we didn't have any knowledge at all on it, so I had to learn some basic stuff. The cultural communication and the lack of technical knowledge made it challenging but I learned quite a lot. It was also my first time managing so many people and such a long project. At the moment of launching, we had about 250 people who were interested in trying the app, which we mainly got through guerilla marketing and certain networks. We didn't really have a good strategy at that time, which is one of the reasons why the startup would shut down later on.",," I have always had an entrepreneurial spirit. I started my first business when I was 12 it was a landscaping and snow removal business that I expanded throughout college and sold it when I was 20. I then studied chemistry so not really related to businesses. Right before starting Rent Nest, I was in finance, trading interest rates on the screen. The idea for this app came from a personal problem. Trying to find an apartment was really difficult because apartments are scattered across many different websites. So I wanted to find an easier way to be able to organize all the information from different sources in one place. I co-founded Rent Nest with a partner who was more focused on the product. ",," We mainly shared Rent Nest on all the social media platforms and tried to acquire customers by rewarding them with some incentive, either money or a prize. That tactic, however, didn’t really work. Another strategy that led to many new customers was the comment and share feature our app had. People who were renting a house with another person would share their list of apartments to his/her partner and this person would need to register in order to see the list and do comments. That worked well within the segment of students. In terms of marketing, I think we missed focus and consistency. We tried content marketing, ads, etc, but we didn’t keep executing those strategies. I would have hoped we had more support from the accelerator in this field. ", Here’s my LinkedIn. You can also reach me through email at steveglod@gmail.com.," This Week in Startups by Jason Calacanis is great. I’m also reading two books a month. One of the best books that I would recommend is called “The Culture Map” by Erin Meyer, which is about businesses across different cultures and how people behave on each of them. Another great one is “Blue Ocean Strategy” by Chan Kim & Renee Mauborgne. “Blue ocean”, according to the book, is like an ocean of customers that haven’t been costumers before and the strategy explained by the authors is how to reinvent something within the business so that you can access this blue ocean. For example, the circus. It took the Ringling Brothers 100 years to create a circus business. Then Cirque du Soleil came with an innovative model and built it like in 30 years, charged four times the amount, and reached many new customers that wouldn’t have gone to a circus before. "," We initially put some money that we raised from our family. Then, we got the investment from the accelerator. Revenue was around $12k/month at our highest. As for expenses, we had between $40k-$50k/month. A lot of it went for developers.

202,rent-round," My name's Raj Dosanjh, I’m 34 years old and the founder of Rent Round.  Post studying Computer Science & Business at university, I focused on creating a consultancy in the investment banking industry & running my own property portfolio. Both of which continue to do well. More recently, Rent Round has been my focus. We provide landlords the ability to compare letting agent fees & ratings. In turn, we provide letting agents with leads, as part of a subscription-based package. I’m glad that the business has gone from strength to strength since its launch last year.  In my spare time, I train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. After 8 years of training, I started my own martial arts club which is going strong with over 30 students. ‍",," The ultimate goal is that my businesses run themselves & my role becomes relatively passive. Currently Rent Round is far from that! The business needs my constant attention. While I find the challenge extremely exciting, it does require many hours of dedication a day. The biggest challenge is balancing my personal life & other businesses.  I had my 2nd child in December and the experience of raising a family is truly amazing. The challenge is ensuring I have the right balance in life. It’s an ongoing pivot between feeling you should be spending more time with your family vs. the guilt of neglecting the business. As Rent Round moves out of it’s ‘startup’ phase, the right balance is easier to achieve. I’m able to handover some activities to my team & switch off to enjoy my family time. Of course, there are exceptions in busy periods, but that's part and parcel of creating a businesses   I’d say my biggest disadvantage is I need to spread my time across multiple businesses, my property portfolio, martial arts club, Rent Round & my financial consultancy. When there are high priorities being raised across the businesses, certain things don’t get my attention as much as they should. In terms of mistakes, we were a victim of our own rapid growth towards the end of 2019. We were growing rapidly and the excitement got the best of me. I planned a large advertising campaign and I also had a number of technical upgrades in the pipeline. The upgrade was to take place over the weekend and the marketing was to start on the following Monday. Needless to say, there were issues with the upgrade, which meant the site wasn't working as it should have been. This resulted in a quite expensive advertising campaign not being as successful as planned. I’ve learned to be more composed and take a step back from my excitement from time to time, as hard as that is. Growth is infectious and momentum is important, but slowing down when required is a key skill to learn. ",," There’s still huge room for growth for Rent Round. There are 16,000 letting agents in the UK and right now we are only at the tip of the iceberg. We had plans to release new functionality & features on the platform to increase our market share significantly in 2020. However, Covid-19 has impacted the property market. We continue to strive for improvements but marketing investment has been paused as agents look to veer around the impact of lockdown. As we continue to grow, we will increase the contracts we have with our freelancer teams. I’m not against hiring staff permanently, I personally think that more people are increasingly comfortable with the gig-based economy choosing their hours, location, and who they work with - This suits me as well. The rental market is only one of the areas I see Rent Round conquering. The buy/sell market is a much larger, albeit more saturated, market. This is also in my sights. In addition currently Rent Round is UK centric. The model will work in other regions which is something we have in our minds to do.",," I started with the model of creating a quick & basic prototype to test the market. As with most entrepreneurs, there’s always the element of doubt if the business will take off. I first decided the business would be a subscription model, based on trends I was seeing across different industries. I then analyzed a few sites that I liked for design inspiration. Finally, I hired an offshore development team that I’ve worked with previously. The prototype took 2 months to build after many long days & iterations, my many changes to how I thought it should work didn’t help the timeline. In parallel, I also drew up a marketing plan to sell the idea to letting agents. This was heavily based on cold calls and emails, asking (begging) agents to take a look at the platform. As I was funding the business myself, I was conscious of getting the business demand tested before investing significantly. So everything up until this point was done at a low cost. I was slowly seeing an increasing demand on the platform which was building my confidence in the idea. That was up until I got featured on a major property platform, which blew up my site traffic. I was inundated with agents signing up to the platform and a high volume of requests. It was difficult to keep up with the growth and interest, but at the same time exciting. The only way I could approach this was head-on. A lot of sacrifices were made and many all-nighters were spent in this period. On the tech side, the development is done by a team in India. I chose them as they’ve done excellent jobs for me and some of my acquaintances in the past. I try to restrict my involvement on the coding site. I have a background in Computer Science, but as the old saying goes ‘too many cooks spoil the broth’ I restrict myself to logging onto the system to make wording, reviewing user activity, and uploading blog content. I’m far more hands-on with wider internet tools. I have a dedicated screen to manage my AdWord campaigns which I’m constantly tinkering with. In addition, I’m constantly logging onto portals such as What’s my SERP & Ubersuggest, to stay on top of SEO improvements.  ‍",," I created Rent Round based on my own experiences when dealing with letting agents. Whenever the properties I own lost a tenant or a new tenancy agreement was needed, a huge amount of phone calls & web searches were needed to understand what fees & services were on offer.  I thought to myself, I should be able to find a letting agent just like I do with my insurances type in my details and up pops a comparison I can choose from. From that Rent Round was born. My motivation was firstly to fill a need that I was sure other property owners were seeking. Secondly, it was to create something I could creatively be proud of. Over the years I created a few failed ventures, most notably a cosmetic business linked to the fitness industry and a student mentoring platform. I was young and made a lot of mistakes, mainly focusing too much on immediate profit. The soap business was trying to follow the trend of the growing fitness industry. The product itself was based on containing natural ingredients that fight common skin ailments in martial arts and gymnasiums. I was tentative in investing sufficiently in the business. In addition most of the profit I took out of the business, as opposed to reinvesting. I was a lot younger then and didn’t have a financial security blanket to lose a chunk of my savings. The student mentoring platform was based on students paying for a mentor who works in the industry that the student wants a career in. The mentor could then become the students way into the industry if the relationship goes well. The largest issue was the price. The mentors were placing a high value on their time, which the students couldn’t really afford. In addition, students weren’t sold on the idea of paying for a mentor, which actually may not increase their chances of getting their foot in the door. We tried to sell the idea to universities, aiming to get them to foot the bill for their students. We found a lot of barriers to get discussions with the right people and gradually the business lost momentum. Now when I create a business, especially with Rent Round, my primary focus is to create something that adds value & is of high quality. I believe once these deliverables are met, profit follows naturally.  ‍"," In my previous answer, I called out the importance of patience and managing growth properly. Looking back this also would have been an important knowledge set when I started the business. I should have been 100% sure of the model, design, and functionality before development of the platform started. It’s a fine balance between getting a product out to market as quickly as possible vs taking a breath and analyzing key decisions more. On the flip side when you start seeing a product being created, new ideas pop up which warrant a change.  I would additionally tell myself to discipline my despair. When there is negative feedback for your business or certain client conversations don’t go as well as you planned, it’s easy to get bogged down and get the feeling that momentum is slowing down.  Downers are part and parcel of business. The ability to overcome them and improve quickly I found a massive advantage.   ‍"," My marketing strategy was based on short & longer-term plans. In the short term, I was heavily reliant on Google Adwords, paying to be shown when people search for keywords relating to my business. In parallel, I invested in reputable property-related advertisements that would help build my brand. Both of these are costly but if done properly can yield very positive results. In the longer term, my strategy is to ensure my site ranks well organically for my keywords. This includes writing huge amounts of property-related content, being featured on related websites & ensuring my platform is search engine friendly. In the present time, I’m moving away from my short term strategy, as Rent Round is gaining more traction on ranking well on search engines. I recall being elated when Rent Round was ranking 1st for the term ‘compare property managers’. It’s not the most searched for the term but it felt like I’d won the lottery! In terms of what has worked well and helped grow my revenue, producing well written, insightful content has been the most fruitful. Other websites are more receptive to posting your content when it adds value. This goes the distance in improving your search engine standing. As a result, the site gets more traffic and therefore conversions. It’s far from easy. Content takes hours to create and reaching out to other websites to host your content can be tricky to manage. As the brand got more familiar with agents and I invested in a redesign to improve the look of the system, the business has seen generous revenue spikes. We are seeing quarterly increases in revenue of about 20%-30%. While we’re not hitting the millions of pounds quite yet, I recouped my initial investment within the first 6 months. While the majority of agents have been pleased with our value, as you could expect with any new business, there have also been pockets of adverse feedback. This has been substantial in improving our service.  For example, in the early days, we realized a number of leads we were obtaining were actually tenants looking for a property to move into, which Rent Round doesn’t cater for.  We were then able to add clarity on our landing pages so it’s clear who the service is for. In addition, it triggered us to adjust our keyword targets so we’re more able to zone in on our key audience.  ‍"," I write a lot of content on the Rent Round Property Blog.

203,repairdesk," Hi, my name is Usman Butt, and I am the founder and CEO of RepairDesk. I am 34-years-old and I hail from Pakistan. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and by profession, I am a salesman, a marketer, a businessman, and most importantly, a friend. I worked with my team to create RepairDesk in 2014. At that time, I wanted to make a repair shop POS software that gave store owners peace of mind. Fast forward to today, RepairDesk has grown exponentially. We’re currently one of the world’s leading repair management software, and our core ethos has remained the same all the way. My role in developing RepairDesk is basically giving my team direction on what to make and insight on what our customers would like to see in our software. To that end, I keep my communication with customers on-point I believe if you’re going to create something for a person, it should always be solving a problem. Talking to my customers gives me the best idea of what they want, and how we can give it to them in a neat little package. Of course, the best way to deliver consistently is through a subscription model. Customers who pay us every month essentially fuel our company and keep us running with ideas. The way I see it, we’re essentially lending our services to repair shop owners in helping them run their business better. ‍",," I think one of the greatest challenges we faced was launching on to the global market from a place like Pakistan. Anyone will tell you that coming from a nascent country and making a mark on international business is really tough, and we did face a lot of troubles along the way. Our country wasn't really in the best position at the time, and we didn't have many of the conveniences that people in the West enjoy. Targeting cell phone and computer repair merchants in the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and other international borders has been difficult. People are often very skeptical of you if they learn you're from somewhere in South-East Asia. Building that first pool of customers was certainly a rough patch, but with enough perseverance, we've managed to break barriers and obtain the trust of merchants worldwide. One recent challenge that we faced was when one of our initial investors wanted to make an exit from the company. With the sudden news of our shareholder making their exit, we had to scramble to deal with acquiring their share and tailor our financial roadmap. It was certainly a tough time, but we managed to make the most of the situation, and I feel we did pretty good for ourselves. ‍",," I feel where we are is absolutely fantastic. The past so-many years have certainly been exciting, and I feel like we’ve got a lot more potential with what we have. RepairDesk is an excellent software that continues to grow and improve, and I am so proud of the work that we’ve done. For the future, we’re working on many fronts using the OKR goal-setting framework. Each quarter, our departments have a list of objectives and key results that we set out to achieve, and we’re religiously working to meet them each week. All our teams – sales, business development, engineering, QA, business analysis, design, human resources, customer support & success, marketing – we’re all stretching ourselves to do the most that we can and help grow the software. We plan on introducing more integrations into RepairDesk, improve on our platform security, and achieve revenue across both our subscription software and our payment platform, RepairDesk Payments.",," When we started out, I had no idea where the journey would lead, but I was as excited as I am today to go down that path. I remember the routine that we had back in the early days - always on call, staying up late at night to fix issues, scraping together whatever we could to improve in the next update. What started off with a team of 5 people (myself included) quickly began to scale and grow, and that motivated me to keep pressing on. I’m really happy that some of our first hires are still with us today. The initial prototyping phase was about 4-5 months, as I remember. Every day, we'd be reviewing over what we'd done, perform audits, and have discussions on what worked and what needed fixing. Once we were confident enough in what we had, we went into a beta launch with some of the prospects that we were talking to. It was an immense joy to learn that in the first month, we had 6 people sign on for our software. That had to have been the happiest moment of my career! It was an incredible feeling. We built RepairDesk on the LAMP stack because of its ability to rapidly develop and deploy applications. Our developers use PHP as our server language, and the frameworks used are Laravel and Yii. For front-end, we're working on a SPA with Vue.js and Bootstrap. Initially, we used SVN for our versioning, but once we were made aware of Git and AWS cloud deployment, our team made the transition to it. As an addition, we've been using Atlassian for their management services in both Jira and BitBucket.",," RepairDesk was conceived out of a need that I felt was prevalent in the repair industry. The idea came to me when I was working with my brother at his cellphone repair shop. We had many repair jobs coming in, a lot of inventory to go through, and needed a system to manage it all. Being an IT-qualified professional, I wanted to solve this issue with technology. So, I got cracking with my idea and started looking for people who could help me out. That's basically how it all started. Thanks to working at my brother's store, I was able to get a fix on what a repair store needed and used that knowledge to build on my idea. Repair jobs assigned needed to be logged, customer records needed to be maintained, inventory had to be kept in check, etc. All I needed was the opportunity to work with a team and develop it. Fortunately, I had already started up a web design company, so I had people who could get things done. I pitched them my idea and we devised a plan on what we needed to do and how to go about it. Before we knew it, we had started work on what would eventually be the first build of RepairDesk. "," Make friends with your customers, period. The more you talk to your customers, the better you'll run your business. Talk to them frequently to see how they are doing and find out their pain points. If you provide them a solution to all their problems with your product or service, you've gained a follower that will tell others about you. Use the organic approach and let your customers be your voice it's the best way to capture the hearts and minds of everyone you want to do business with. ‍  If I had the chance to go back, I’d probably do it all over again! The journey we’re taken so far as a team has been an incredible one, and I’ve learned a lot from the experiences I’ve had. Everyone faces challenges, sure, but I believe that those challenges are what help you refine yourself and become truly special. After all, even coal turns to diamond after tons of pressure. There are a couple of things that I would have altered in my journey, had I had the chance to go back. I think greater foresight would have really been helpful, and being able to assemble my team faster would obviously have been great. But the way the journey has turned out so far, I feel the best is yet to come. To my younger self, I would say this: keep going, tiger! Keep pushing forward, keep following your passion obsessively, and never look back. The world is so much bigger than what it seems right now, and you’re on the right track to make it big. Always remember where you come from, and never forget to be thankful for everything. ‍"," Since starting RepairDesk, my main focus has always been to give our customers the best. That meant the best customer service, the best features, the best whatever. Our efforts turned out to generate very positive feedback and organic growth. To that end, I believe our close connection with customers has helped immensely since we always kept an interest in the challenges and issues they faced, and how we can provide a solution for them to reach new levels of success. While our initial focus was targeting small home-based repair shops, we wanted to grow and expand and start playing with the big guns. For that, we consulted many SaaS experts, figuring out how we could provide the best service in a single platform and make it profitable. We then worked with the best I.T. professionals in our area to make improvements to RepairDesk and build on it even further. In two months, we had more than 100 repair stores that used our cloud-based POS software. That was a major win for us, being able to target all these cell phone repair shops. Still, we wanted to be better and make more improvements, so we used our knowledge and experience, along with valuable feedback, to develop our software to fit any type of repair need worldwide. I made it a point to focus squarely on maintaining great customer relationships. Talking to people was always my strong suit, and I relished in getting to know more about the people that bought RepairDesk and understanding their needs. I feel that the more you talk to a customer, the more you learn the inner workings of their circumstances. I wanted to be able to know everything that bothered them and help them find a solution for it. My desire to learn more led me to attend the Consumer Electronics Show, the world's largest tech expo, in 2019. I went to Las Vegas to attend the 'All Wireless & Prepaid Expo' and touch base with my core audience, putting a face to the name. The physical appearance at these two big shows gave us a lot of positive outreach, and we met potential customers, discussed their problems, and provided them with a quick demo of our repair shop POS software. Working with customers however wasn't the only thing that helped us. I used my people skills to also reach out for partnerships with cellphone suppliers in the market. The repair industry goes hand-in-hand with the repair parts industry, and we decided to start promotions in partnership with leading suppliers in the market. Our collaborations with MobileSentrix and Injured Gadgets boosted our customer base and resulted in many quality conversions for our business. Our team is constantly learning and experimenting with marketing strategies, figuring out how we can break new ground to reach out even more. That's the essence of SaaS-based businesses. We're now looking to add some PPC campaigns in our marketing plan and are hoping it will help RepairDesk grow even further. "," Want to learn more? You are always welcome to RepairDesk.

204,repitchbook," Hi Failory! My name is Charlie Reese and I’m a software developer working out of Toronto, Canada. I grew up about an hour north of Toronto on a farm. After high school, I enrolled in Commerce (business) at Queen’s University, and later started my career in M&A investment banking. Investment banking sucked (a lot), so after ~3 years I quit to travel, surf, and learn to code. After a year of pain (learning to code from scratch was not easy for me) I started to get the hang of programming, and was hired as a full-stack / back-end developer at Tulip Retail (we’re hiring). In late 2017, I founded a startup called REPitchbook. It was revolutionary - it generated customizable management consulting style presentations from real estate market data IN SECONDS. It also made 0 dollars. I’m happy to tell my story! These days, I’m the founder and lead software engineer for what I think is the best stock screener and alerting application available online - MarketSnitch. I definitely took the lessons from REPitchbook and learned what not to do! ‍"," I think REPitchbook failed for two reasons: A horrible user interface pilot customers were not able to figure out how to use the application.No email integration pilot customers did most of their marketing through email, not long-form print / presentations. After spending 6 weeks trying to alter the product to appease my pilot customers, it became clear that the design was so bad that there was almost no hope. Further, since it was a SPA (single page application), the poor UI was tightly coupled with the back-end logic the application required a complete rebuild. After 6 weeks of piloting the project, I decided to kill it. At the time I didn’t feel I had the skills required to pivot / rebuild the company (I was new to programming and design), and I wasn’t ready to invest more time into it since I hadn’t made any real sales. In hindsight, I probably should have brought in another developer or designer... I wanted to learn to program and build products myself though I wasn’t willing to delegate. All in all, I felt pretty defeated. ‍"," My biggest challenge regarding REPitchbook was building a user-friendly, secure prototype with my limited programming experience. I definitely made a lot of mistakes while building REPitchbook, and I’ll outline the 3 most important ones below. My first mistake was that I tried to add too many features to the initial product. The result of this was lots of features that felt half complete and clumsy, and no features that felt finished. I think this contributed to the poor, confusing user experience of the application. My second mistake was that I didn’t adjust for initial customer feedback pertaining to the product’s poor design. No one specifically said it, but 100% of agents were unable to use the application without instruction when I met them in person. I think it’s pretty safe to say that if users can’t use your application without guidance, you probably need to improve your UI / UX. My third mistake was that I didn’t validate the idea before I started building. I assumed real estate agents wanted to pitch potential clients using professional presentations. Almost none of them wanted to do that (they wanted to market to potential clients using email).",,,," Using my newly acquired JavaScript, React, and SQL skills, I hacked together a (laughably insecure) prototype over 6 weeks. After the prototype was complete, I set up a meeting through a family member with the owner of several real estate brokerages. I showed him the prototype, and showed him the presentations it could generate. He loved it, and he gave me the go-ahead to do a pilot project with 4 real estate agents in one of his brokerages. If the 4 agents testing it liked it, we agreed that I would give all the agents in the brokerage (about 100) access for $1500 / month. REPitchbook was also publicly accessible online (individual agents could sign up), but it received minimal traffic. I didn’t spend any time on ads or SEO.",," As a former investment banker, it was my job to prepare presentations and analysis for clients to win deals. After spending ~8 months learning to code, I thought: “if I made it easy for others to create management consulting style presentations / pitches, they too could win deals. Professional pitches for everyone!” That thought was enough to motivate me to start working full-time on the MVP for REPitchbook I worked on the MVP for several hundred hours over the next 6 weeks. I definitely should have put more thought into the product, target market, etc. More on that later. ‍"," First of all, I would include fewer features in REPitchbook’s MVP. This would allow for fewer, more polished features, resulting in a less confusing, more agreeable experience. Second of all, I would talk to customers (and perhaps sell to customers) before writing any code. Talking to customers helps you prevent wasted effort and develop a product your customers want in less iterations.  Finally, I would spend WAY MORE time working on the design of the application. This experience taught me that, to your user, your design is your product. Said another way, if your UI / UX makes your user feel stupid, your UI / UX is stupid, and users won’t want your product. ‍"," At the time, the “digital marketing” landscape was new to me. Because of this, I was most comfortable with in-person marketing (i.e. setting up meetings / coffees with potential customers). I also did some cold-calling, but had little success with that. After I secured a pilot project and some initial users, I continued meeting with other brokerages and pitching them the product. At this point, my marketing strategy was to get pilot projects at other brokerages (through emails, calls, and in person meetings), and convert the pilot projects into sales. While talking to current and potential pilot customers, it slowly became clear that there were some pretty major product issues. ‍"," Visit Charlie Reese to learn more about me / how I learned to code, and MarketSnitch to learn more about the startup I’m currently working on!"," My favourite entrepreneurial website is IndieHackers. Definitely check it out if you haven’t already - they are doing a great job dispelling the notion that you need VC funding to successfully grow your business. Otherwise, I like to learn by reading - I have four favourite books. My favourite book on sales is Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth (by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares).This book is a no nonsense guide to the many sales channels available to every startup. It discusses why many startups wrongfully ignore most sales channels, and how any startup can identify which channel is best for them.My favourite book on design is The Design of Everyday Things (by Don Norman). I now refer to this book as the Design Bible. It is overflowing with useful insights for improving your products UI / UX. It is not only for application design (hence the title), but it still very relevant for technical creators.My favourite book on technology entrepreneurship is Hello, Startup (by Yevgeniy Brikman). This book is a crash course on everything you should know if you are a developer who wants to start (or work at) a startup.My favourite book on data science / consulting is Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets (by Nassim Nicholas Taleb). This book will change the way you look at market information (and possibly those working in financial / information markets) forever. This book helped me understand why I could safely ignore most people pontificating on BNN. ‍"," Ah yes, now the most embarrassing question.  I made $0 in revenue (for the reasons mentioned above), despite getting a pilot project fairly quickly and lots of positive feedback on what the application was capable of producing. If there is a silver lining to this failure, it is that expenses were minimal (other than my time) since I did not outsource any of the development / marketing work I’d guess expenses were ~$1000 all in. ‍",Software & Hardware,Poor Product,Canada,"March 28, 2019",Charlie Reese,https://www.failory.com/interview/repitchbook,"['https://charliereese.ca', 'https://marketsnitch.com']",failure,0,,"Charlie Reese is a Canadian software developer who came with (what he thought it was) a revolutionary idea for a SaaS business in the real estate industry.

205,reroute-lifestyle," During my transition to “adulthood,” the chase after the American dream never made sense to me. We worked so hard to pay off our student loans. And then what? Upgrade our car? Start a family? Take on a mortgage for a home? Buy another car? And in 2017, I started a lifestyle and travel blog. I wanted to inspire millennial women to say “yes” to more opportunities outside of the American dream - while still being financially savvy. Within just a few days after starting my blog, I made a whopping $0.44 commission from Amazon Affiliates. And that’s when I realized I could make money blogging. Soon, I learned there is an entire community of people who leverage the Internet to make money online - blogging, freelancing, remote work… The idea for Reroute Lifestyle came several months later. I traveled across the Atlantic for the first time with my boyfriend at the time. We returned from our days exploring the Cote d’Azur to emails with notifications of affiliate sales. Now, Reroute Lifestyle helps goal getters create the financial freedom they need to make money online, ditch the 9-5, and be in control of their own schedule. ‍",," When it came to managing Reroute Lifestyle as a business, the biggest mindset I had to overcome was my money mindset. I transitioned from being a penny-pincher to being a business-owner allocating every penny earned. I’m trying to make calculated, strategic investments in my business instead of just letting any money earned sit in a bank account. Personally, the transition to self-employment was difficult. I was sick right after my last day at my day job. Of course, that week I moped around the house missing paid time off benefits. I also struggled to devote “full-time” work on this blog - and regularly. I didn’t know how to grow my task list so that I would spend 40 hours, or more, on the blog every week. Now, I try to balance: Promotion - Pinterest, SmarterQueue, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.Content Writing - at least 1 post, at least 1 email.Networking - interviews, guest-posting.Growth Analysis - audience behavior, affiliate performance, and email list growth.Side Projects - eBook writing, blog consulting. ‍ These tasks don’t fit into 40 hours per week yet, but I’ll get there one day. ‍  Constantly changing my mission and audience.  Again, I’m multi-passionate. I thought I could really niche down with Reroute Lifestyle. But as I kept writing for the blog, I realized that I’m happiest when I’m writing about multiple topics. This made growing hard. A lot of people follow me for my tips about affiliate marketing, but I want to branch out and write about travel and side hustles while traveling. I’m very cognizant of this, so I try to keep one main theme with my content: leveraging the internet to make money online, so you can work from anywhere. ‍",,," I am a multi-passionate, so inherently I love writing about multiple topics. Niche-related blogs have it easier in the sense that they can target their audience better in their marketing, their content, and their product creation. But the biggest disadvantage I give myself is being unable to niche down even further."," Because volatile in the digital industry can be volatile when you’re first starting, Reroute Lifestyle makes income in 3 ways: Affiliate MarketingProduct SalesServices   To make money blogging, you need a source of income (like affiliate marketing), content that advertises those affiliates, and a targeted audience to consume the content. Reroute Lifestyle’s primary revenue-generator is through affiliate marketing. Our income started on a small scale: before we built our website, we put together a mini-ebook with some affiliate links. We offered that ebook as a freebie to grow our mailing list at the same time. As we built the website, we circulated that mini-ebook via Pinterest. With this in mind, I plan to at least double Reroute Lifestyle’s affiliate income in 2018. Keep writing content, some with affiliate links.Continue growing our audience acquisition with Pinterest.Turn readers into lifelong followers by offering email freebies and free information with our newsletter.",,," If I had to start over, I would do less with more. At Reroute Lifestyle’s launch, I wanted to have multiple opt-ins, and 8 different posts in multiple categories. Instead, I wish I: Outlined one specific transformation to offer readers,Created one mind-blowing opt-in (instead of several),Written a few in-depth posts optimized for engagement and sales. ‍ Even though it took us a month to put together Reroute Lifestyle (at the time, I worked at my day-job on the side), I wish I took a step back to focus on creating LESS content (posts & email opt-ins) with MORE value. ‍"," Putting both time and money into Pinterest has tremendously helped me grow a brand-new blog to over 11,000 page views per month in 6 months. ‍ For other platforms, my main strategy was to nail my storytelling. There’s a reason why people visit Reroute Lifestyle. It’s because they want the freedom to be the CEO of their own life - in other words, they want to make decisions for themselves. And they want to leverage the Internet in order to work for that freedom. So, when I guest post on other blogs, schedule posts to Twitter, or post on Reroute Lifestyle’s Facebook page, I think about storytelling first. ‍"," Read more about my journey to ditch my 9-5 life and Reroute Lifestyle here.

206,resumemaker," My name is Fernando Pessagno, I am a 35 years old Argentinian Product Designer, currently living in Tallinn, Estonia. I moved to Europe in late 2020 after landing an amazing full-time job at an AI startup, and I focus on my personal business in my free time: ResumeMaker.Online, the easiest-to-use resume maker. ‍",," I knew that building an MVP was the way to go, but even if that was the case, I could have shared the progress much earlier and reduced time and costs. I remember feeling a little uneasy about showing my early progress, feeling the product was still not good enough. It was quite hard for me to slowly stop being shy about it. Big mistake! Later on, it was way harder to cut off all the features that I've already implemented and invested time in. Lesson learned: if you don't feel a bit uneasy while sharing your work in progress, then that is a clear sign that you should have shared it a long time before. ",," Nowadays a lot of things have changed. ResumeMaker.Online has had a huge impact on my professional life. In August 2020 I moved to Europe after landing a job at an amazing AI startup in Europe, while I still focus on my projects during my free time. To date, more than 700,000 resumes have been downloaded on ResumeMaker.Online and it currently averages +$1,500/m after the recently introduced v2.0. I´m not going to lie and say I don't think for a second about how cool it would be to move back or relocate to southeast Asia. I could easily lower my expenses and work only on my products from a hammock with a perfect tan and a drink in hand. It's an unrealistic idea that doesn't align with my personal goals, although provides a comforting feeling to know that I could *theoretically* abandon the rat race today. It fuels my desire to build new products and generate multiple income sources to accomplish the European version of that dream scenario. Luckily, I like my job and it helps to keep my risk profile low while I live in a first-world country and develop my own business in my free time.  The next steps then are introducing price localization and a newsletter subscription, while I shift my focus to marketing instead of product development, now that I'm extremely proud of the product in terms of its new features and improved performance. ‍",," Working on a personal side project was an amazing and liberating experience. However, with no clients that needed the work to be done by a certain date, I was tempted to add unnecessary cool features for no reason but to feed my ego. As the product´s main strength was supposed to be its simplicity of use, I had to be strict and ask myself: which of all possible features are going to add real value for the user? Luckily I had a two-month-long backpacking trip around Europe planned for later that year, as part of the plan of avoiding burnout, and I took full advantage of it. Since I stayed in multiple hostels, I was able to interview potential users daily, identify friction points and understand their needs way better. For example, at an early stage of development ResumeMaker.Online had several resume templates to choose from. People with some kind of knowledge or appreciation for design would quickly pick the one that suited them better. But it came to my surprise that, for most users, the freedom to fully customize the template was leading to decision paralysis and frustration. After I got back home, I removed all the features that did not fully support the core concept (including the ability to choose different templates), polished the UI, and I was confident the product was ready for launch. On launch day in August 2018, I posted ResumeMaker.Online on Product Hunt without any real expectations. This was my first product ever and, even if I was happy with the result, it came as a total surprise when it was selected as the number one product of the day and the number one product of the week. During the first month, more than *20,000* resumes were downloaded from more than 100 countries and it snowballed into countless websites and people sharing and tweeting about it, so I got it quite easy to attract the first users. Beginner´s luck maybe? At first, ResumeMaker.Online was never meant to be something other than a fun side project. However, the launch was far more successful than I could’ve ever anticipated, and it opened the doors for considering ways to monetize it. The validation that being featured by Product Hunt provided was a big first step, although I still needed to find out if users would be willing to pay for it. In this initial stage, I was skeptical of adding a paid version, as I felt it could get in the way of the growth. Instead, I added a donation form with fixed values. To my surprise, users were donating up to $20 per resume! This was the ultimate way of validating the product and, on top of that, a useful way to find out what could be the price most users will be willing to pay. During the first two years of ResumeMaker.Online, I kept this strategy to focus on growth, offered a 100% free download, and monetized the product sporadically via sponsored links to other sites that wanted to connect with my audience. When the pandemic arrived last year, the deals with my sponsors took a hit and I thought it was then time to offer a “PRO” download instead. The free version is still available for all users (especially during these times) but now they can also gain access to a higher resolution and watermark-free paid version. ‍",," In early 2018 I was managing a small digital design studio in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Life was good, but after more than 10 years of only doing client work, my passion for design wasn’t there anymore. I could see the burnout on the horizon, so I knew I needed to do something about it. During my early teens, in the almost prehistoric era of Geocities, I used to spend entire days and nights building Dragon Ball websites instead of playing video games. It was just too much fun! I missed that feeling and I wanted to reconnect with the playful side of being a designer. The problem was that I wanted to build *something*, not just anything, and I couldn't figure out what. One day, my sister asked for help to build her resume and I couldn’t find a straightforward online tool to share with her.  The small group of websites that did do a good job had too many features, which made them unintuitive for the average user. Moreover, many of the paid options forced users to sign-up before even allowing them to test the service, and a few others had dishonest and non-transparent pricing methods. Then the idea came to me: to create ResumeMaker.Online, a WYSIWYG web app that could enable even non-tech-savvy users to design an attractive resume in just minutes. It was a win-win scenario. On the one hand, I could hopefully help people in something as important as their job search. On the other, it was a great way to put my design and coding skills to a test in a challenging and fun personal side project, something I had wanted to do for years."," As a solo founder, I know it can be extremely overwhelming to think about creating a profitable product when just starting, but instead of giving advice, I´ll tell you what worked for me. I´m not a “proper” developer. I'm more like a designer who knows how to code, so it was natural to underestimate myself and to think small when I started building ResumeMaker.Online. It sounds counterintuitive, but while working on it, ending up earning money never crossed my mind. In retrospect, I think this undisturbed and humble approach to just try and design a useful product was key to avoiding frustration, not biting more than I could chew, and ultimately shipping the product. "," Being selected 1st product of the day + 1st product of the week in PH created a snowball effect with countless websites and users sharing on social media and writing articles about it.  It's fair to assume that keeping the product 100% free for almost two years helped to keep a steady traffic growth by word of mouth, and the altruistic perceived nature of it provided an extra incentive for people to share it on social media.  SEO helped a lot too, of course, reaching at one point a 3º global rank for ""resume maker"". Adding support for seven languages helped a bit (although 85% of the traffic still goes to the English version). Currently, users need to share a link to gain access to the free version (which contains a small watermark with a link), which certainly helps."," It would be great to continue the conversation in the comments if you want to share your feedback or for feature requests.

207,ringdaddy," My background is in marketing, specifically digital marketing. I’m currently a Digital Marketing Manager at 42Chat and a creator. I’m also making tutorials on how I made different parts of RingDaddy because a lot of people were curious. ‍"," I launched with a total of 10 streamers. When these big guys jumped in and started promoting it to their viewers, they were hesitant to give their phone number. At first, I thought it was one streamer. If I optimized the landing page it would seem more trustworthy. Then the second streamer promoted it. It was a consistent problem that viewers were very reluctant to give their phone numbers. What happened is that the streamers themselves were reluctant to promote it because their audience's reaction was negative. It made it even worse. "," Pricing was the hardest challenge because, with Twilio, I expected to pay 0.7 cents per text message with them. That doesn't sound like much, but it adds up fairly quickly. If a streamer has 200 subscribers on RingDaddy and they sent out a single text message that's gonna cost me $1.5. But let's say they do that 15 times a month. That's $22.5. The bigger they are, the more expensive it gets. I wouldn't say selling it to streamers was a challenge because they understood the value almost right away. There's a lot of remarketing potential. Streamers already have success. They know how to reach their audience. They know how to entertain their audience. They just don't have the right tools to remarket. But there was hesitation from their viewer base to subscribe. I think that's because people consider phone numbers a more personal thing. There was an educational element for viewers too. They were wondering: “What is it?” “Is this spam?”. When one big streamer posted it, the first comments were people thinking he got hacked. It's just such a weird thing to ask for people's phone numbers. ‍",,,," RingDaddy was built using Webflow, MemberStack, Zapier, Airtable, and Twilio, all no-code tools. MemberStack was used to manage memberships and segregate data. Zapier was used to transfer data back and forth, and Airtable acted as the backend. Twilio was used to manage text messages. The fact that these are all no-code tools allowed me to build RingDaddy in just three days. "," I knew a few people at UCI eSports, which is a University in Southern California. I also had a lot of friends in the Smash community. This is one of those cases where I tried to build a product where I already had an audience. I just ended up reaching out to as many people as I knew and asked them to reach out to people that they knew. That way I was able to get some big streamers to beta test it. ‍"," I used to stream for fun and I also know and watch a lot of streamers. What I’ve noticed about streamers is that despite being great at entertaining their audience, they’re not very good at engaging with their audience. What I mean by that is that when a streamer goes live, they might post about it on social media which is a terrible channel for engagement, and they’ll be lucky if 15% - 20% of their audience sees that. RingDaddy is meant to solve that because text messages have a 95% open rate. SMS marketing is a fairly untapped marketing channel, but it’s incredibly powerful. It’s the difference between streamers re-engaging with 15%-20% of their audience versus 95% of their audience. ‍"," I would keep the product the same and maybe target a different user base. I would target small businesses as a remarketing channel. I would try to make it a Twitch plugin so it could be it could pop up on the stream. It would remove the barrier experience where people are hesitant to give away their phone numbers. ‍  The biggest takeaway from my experience is that you don't need to spend months planning out an MVP. “You can build an MVP in a week and focus on getting validating it.” When it comes to building a startup, focus on what you know, or what you have an audience for. I was able to test out RingDaddy very quickly. I knew it didn't work within a month, so I didn't waste a lot of time on it. I was able to do that because I knew that I could get streamers rapidly on board. “Think of problems for things that you know, subjects that you know.” I have two other failed startups. It took me 4-6 months to build each and they took a lot more resources. It's helpful to focus on simpler ideas and key things that differentiate your product. RingDaddy was two different forms, one of which lets you collect phone numbers and the second one, which lets you send out texts to the phone numbers you collect. That's the entire product and that was enough to get some revenue and to get people signed up. ‍",,," Zero to Sold by Arvid Kahl is a great read that I highly recommend. In regards to community and support, it's crazy to me how much I've been able to network off of Twitter by engaging with other makers and communities. It also led me to some of the streamers by just messaging them on Twitter. Twitter lets you build that audience as well. You're not just connecting with other people. I have probably around 600 high-engaged no-code followers. If I were to release a no-code product for that niche audience, I could get a lot of subscribers very quickly. Makerpad is also a great resource. You don't even have to buy the membership, they have great no-code tutorials. The first tool I recommend is Webflow and particularly Webflow University, which has just a crazy amount of tutorials on everything you need to build a landing page. ‍ Where can we go to learn more? Here’s the tutorial where I explain how I built RingDaddy. You can also find me on Twitter and my website."," I made $50 from subscriptions. I made more money selling the no-code template on Webflow to people than I made from recurring revenue to streamers. There was a lot more interest in how I made the product than the product itself from its targeted audience. The subscriptions cost me $100. I lost some money on that, but the small loss is worth it for how fast I was able to build it.

208,rize," My name is Will Goto, and I'm the co-founder and CEO of Rize. Rize is a productivity tool that tracks your time to help you understand how you spend your time, improve your focus, and build better work habits. We provide a monthly subscription to use the service for $15 a month. ‍",,,," I couldn't be happier with our progress. We hit over $11,000 in sales for October—just 6 months after hitting the #1 product of the day on Product Hunt. We are proud of this milestone, mainly because we're still a two-person team without any outside funding sources. Our purpose with Rize is to help anyone achieve their productivity goals with actionable insights and data. Those goals can be anything from working fewer hours to improving their ability to focus. At the moment, the product can track and show your data back to you so that you may draw your conclusions, but we want to include our own suggestions and methodologies as well. Our vision for Rize is to tell new users how to achieve their goals with minimal effort. ",," Our idea was mainly to create a productivity tracker that represented time in a way where users could derive actionable insights to improve their productivity—a trait that most time management tools lacked. Based on our interviews and feedback from our waitlist, we needed something to help people know how they spend their time, improve their ability to focus, and build better habits for taking breaks. With those three value propositions in mind, we got to work and kept iterating on our product with users from our waitlist. It was a relatively simple process of interviewing users, analyzing feedback, tweaking the product, and repeating. Because we knew who our target market was, we knew which feature requests to prioritize and which to discard. We didn't have that guidance when we were building Humble Dot. In terms of resources, we didn't need any outside help, so our iterations were quick. I think this is a requirement for startups—the need to execute quickly allows startups to compete with incumbents. Without speed, a startup has no competitive edge, in my opinion. ",," Our story starts with Humble Dot, a company that I started with my co-founder in 2017. We raised over $3.1 million in funding over two rounds: the first was a $535k pre-seed round led by Afore Capital, and the second was a $2.6 million seed round led by Susa Ventures (Robinhood). We were on top of the world, our name was starting to get out in VC circles, we had an incredible team of 8, and people were beginning to recognize us. But we failed. Even with funding, we were unable to find product-market fit over three years. We tried every growth tactic and marketing strategy we could come up with, but nothing allowed us to hit the parabolic growth that VCs demanded. We ultimately shut down the company in the middle of 2020 and returned just over a third of our investment money to our investors. My co-founder and I were pretty devastated, but it gave us time to reflect on why Humble Dot was such a complex product to market. One of the main reasons was that we built a product without ever choosing an initial niche or ""wedge"". We directly left our jobs at Twitter and began building an asynchronous communication tool meant for anyone to use. Eventually, we ended up with a tool that did many things well but never really was amazing at one thing for a specific group of people. In the end, we built something and tried to market it instead of doing the market research upfront and making the best product that a market needs. After shutting down Humble Dot, we started with software engineers as our target market. After hundreds of interviews, we found that ""not feeling productive or efficient enough with time at work"" was one of the biggest problems our target market had. We then tested value propositions that would help people with this productivity-focused goal in mind—that is when our path to Rize started."," Every startup is different. Tactics and strategies that work for one may not work for another, even if the businesses are incredibly similar. We initially thought SEO would be our best tactic for growth since it's an ""obvious"" choice for the type of tool we're selling. It turned out to be the hardest for us to break into and gain traction. We also didn't expect using influencers would be something that worked as well. I think for startups, you simply have to try many different approaches and tactics yourself, learn from them, then refine or change your approach. There's only so much that other people can do to help you grow. "," Our marketing strategy started before we built anything. We looked at competitors in the space and picked a position that would make the most sense for what we wanted to build and what our target market would resonate with. Any marketing effort we did later greatly benefited from this initial work. Overall, I think there were three primary tactics that we used to grow the business: Referral program - we give both the person giving and receiving the referral a free month of Rize. I think this system has worked exceptionally well with Rize due to its aesthetic and brand. People love sharing cool stuff with their friends and colleagues, and providing a monetary incentive behind it helped. Content creators - leveraging creators is essentially the same tactic, in principle, as the referral program but on a one-to-many relationship. We either give the creator a lifetime subscription or a sponsorship in exchange for YouTube videos, tweets, and other pieces of content that have the potential to reach our target audience. Lifetime & annual sales - revenue is much more helpful for growing your business when you get it upfront. When you're starting, earning $80 in one month is probably 100x more valuable to you than getting $100 over a year. Our cash flow is more than double that of our MRR, and because of that, we can use the money to reinvest in growth initiatives right away."," For Rize, simply check out our site.

209,ropero," Hey! My name is Rafael Soto, I've been making weird stuff on the web since I was 15 (2001), I'm from Mexico and I have a master's degree in marketing. Five years ago I moved from my small city to Mexico City and founded Osom Marketing, a boutique digital marketing agency. Early on Osom's life I found what a mess the taxes are here —and I'm not even talking about accounting—, just preparing the information required by my accountant required up to 6 hours per month, which I thought it was crazy! Long story short, being a hacker and loving automating things, I created a script that would download the invoice's files from my Gmail (which are XML files), and then created an Excel file, saving at least 3 hours. As I started talking to other business owners, both small and medium, I realized there was an opportunity, and since two years ago, I started Box Factura, and although it has been tough, we're growing and the customers are loving it! It has been quite a journey after failing on a movie theatre guide/social network (so you could select the movie to watch and go to the nearest theatre, instead of selecting first the theatre and see if it's available), an images and videos website, and a t-shirt marketplace (Ropero). ‍"," Being solo and selling physical products can get very hard as you have to do all by yourself: from the tech side, the sales process and actually creating the product. Also, I had to invest on printing the t-shirts, which I didn't know if they would be sold, or in what quantity and sizes. Also, Mexico wasn't ready for e-commerce. Still, to this day, I know for a fact that Amazon is struggling to reach the masses, as they often don't have credit cards, or don't trust buying via the Internet. Now imagine this scenario, but more than ten years ago! ‍"," I think I started too big. I should have kept it small, printing fewer t-shirts even if I wasn't earning anything, or event at a loss. That would have helped me validate the need for a platform like Ropero. Also, relying on a payment processor like PayPal was not a good idea, although there was literally no other option available. The main issue with PayPal is that you hand over the control and experience for the checkout to a third party, and it ends up plummeting the sales process. ‍",,," Being far from a big city was a major issue because shipments are expensive in Mexico. Working alone didn't help as well, especially if you are working or studying, this kind of things require at least half-time focus.",," Mostly through my personal blog, which had quite some audience, but then through SEO, it started to bring some leads as well. Social media was not very big back in those days, so it was out of the picture."," As I stated, Ropero (literally Wardrobe) was a t-shirt marketplace inspired by Threadless. I started it in 2005 when I was 20 and wanted to do some real business on the web. I had no business plan, no investment, just plain motivation and a few free hours every day. ‍"," Think smaller, for sure! Finding a good market-fit early on would have helped a lot: not only on the sales and printing side but also on the business plan (which, of course, I didn't have). ‍  There are some things you can learn by reading, but there are others you have to experience by yourself, even if those don't end up where you wanted. Having failed to achieve the goals with Ropero, I found that selling physical products is hard (and perhaps, not for me?), so I'm now focusing on a SaaS model. Also, when you're selling B2C, you'll have to sell a lot to break even, and it means convincing a lot of people for a product that maybe they don't think they need it. Meanwhile, on B2B you can earn a living with just a handful of clients, although their requirements are radically different. From these, and many other experiences, I've learned a lot: what MVP really is, how to negotiate, the channels to market your product, finding good partners, why UX is important, and even how to build an e-commerce site! So yeah, go ahead and start something. I bet you won't regret it. ‍",," You can follow me on twitter on @rafael_soto_, read my blog whenever I feel like writing or just reaching me at rsoto@boxfactura.com.",,,e-Commerce,Bad Market Fit,Mexico,"March 17, 2018",Rafael Soto,https://www.failory.com/interview/ropero,"['https://twitter.com/rafael_soto_', 'http://www.therror.com/', 'mailto:%20rsoto@boxfactura.com']",failure,0,,Ropero was an e-commerce aiming to sell t-shirts in an unprepared market.

As far as Salonist is concerned, it is all-in-one Salon Software that addresses the requirements of salons, spas, yoga and tattoo studios, medical spas, and other businesses in the beauty, health, and wellness industry. This solution aims to streamline the daily chaos faced by Salons or spa owners.  Salonist's technology relies on three bases capabilities, speedy and reliable service to support end-to-end business operations. This core Salon and Spa solution allows the owners to personalize customer's experiences, manage daily operations, and increase revenues. Until now, many SMEs have started using it because of its impeccable features service instead of wasting their time on admin work. From online booking to inventory management, Point of Sale (POS), multi-location management, employee and customer management, report and analytics to marketing, it manages all. My job responsibility here is to keep up the Salonist as my customer’s expectations and to serve them perfectly.  I prefer to add or amend the features of Salonist from time to time to match with the latest Salon trends and technologies. To make it user-friendly and transparent, I always look after all the fundamentals related to the Software, such as, high-quality content and images, website speed, errors/warnings, responsiveness, etc. ‍",," When it is about handling the business, certainly, obstacles and mistakes come in between. Overpowering them on time does not let the business hamper in any way. As I have learned a lot about managing the business, so, until now, I haven't come across any obstacles and tried to fulfill every task with great efficiency and more authenticity. ‍",," Everyone wants to improve and excel in their business in the future and I dream for the same as well.  An exact figure of revenue cannot be disclosed. My main focus is to meet the expectations of the Salon owners that they have from my Software. So, I allow my team members to keep themselves updated with trendy or new features and provide 24x7 support and maintenance services. Now, we have 90+ employees and in the future, I, assuredly, will hire more professional and talented staff to implement innovative ideas to boost sales, revenue, and indeed, customer volume. There are approximately 10,000 customers who are using Salonist worldwide. As of now, there is no such metric that needs improvement. Until now, our customers are satisfied with the software and in case of any issue, our support team is there to assist them. ‍",," We researched the market and then we created the user stories. We use Jira for the user stories and then our scrum masters created the tasks accordingly for the developers. We have not faced any obstacles as we are in the software industry since 2011 so we know how we can make the system successful. First, we launched the beta version and then installed it in some locations in Paragon Mall Singapore. They provided their inputs and then we enhanced the system more according to their requirements. The best thing is we do have a ticket system where customers can send their requests. Our technical team analyzes them and we implement them into the system if it's useful for everyone.",," I started my career in the IT field by introducing Awebstar Technologies in Singapore and grew the company to a great extent. Once a Salon owner approached us for creating their Salon website. As demanded, we have delivered the project at the required time. The Salon owner has discussed the issues they are facing in selling the products and scheduling the appointments online. Considering that, I have decided to look after this matter in-depth. After visiting the nearby Salons and researching, I got to know the loopholes in the beauty industry. Here, my interest in making a solution that can power the salons or spa with a simple yet powerful experience emerged. I intended to provide them a supported system that not only helps them to manage the daily operational tasks but to assure them the highest sales and more footfall. This includes the total eradication of their admin work. And then, knowing all the major requirements of the Salon, I launched Salonist. This is a cloud-based Salon Software with the purpose to satisfy all the challenges faced by Salons every day and improve their brand value."," Every day comes with a new lesson and I am learning a lot. And, when it is about Salonist, my main concern is improving its outreach. So, I prefer to communicate with the customers whenever they have questions or some maintenance issues. It is important to keep a regular follow-up with them to know if they are satisfied with what we are delivering or they need some improvements. I schedule meetings with the team members every week to integrate and implement new ideas to Salonist. Above all, to carry out every single task correctly, time management is necessary and I am keeping it at pace."," While thinking of creating the Salon solution, I knew that owning, maintaining, and marketing the software are different things. So, after launching the Salonist, first of all, I have made it registered in the list of the Salon Software. Later, the social media pages were created and the promotion started. For organic traffic, we also have started digital marketing at the same time. This way, our Software’s visibility increased in Google search results. After promotion, people started signing up and started using Salonist as we provide a 14-day free trial. The interested ones have approached us and registered with the software. Not to forget, we also got many customers from referrals. Now, our software is being used by many and is ranking well. ‍"," You can visit our blog to know and learn more about Salonist.

211,scalefusion," Hi Rich! I am Harishanker Kannan. Based out of Pune, India, I am the Co-Founder and CEO at Scalefusion.  Scalefusion is a simple-to-use Mobility Management platform tailored for businesses to get up and running quickly. With Scalefusion, companies can configure their devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets and other digital devices for business use without hiring a specialized IT team. This includes, configuring the devices to run only business-related apps and websites, preventing data copy from these devices and ensuring that only authorized users have access to the device.  These devices can be used as customer-facing devices, for eg. for self-ordering at a take-away, can be used by employees- eg, the handheld devices used by last-mile delivery guys or used by students- for eg, the tablets used in classrooms.  In an office setup for example, when an employee is given a smartphone or a laptop for work, Scalefusion ensures that it is used only for work and nothing more. Companies can define the usage policies, block entertainment websites, gaming apps etc and ensure that employees are not distracted at the same time making full use of digital devices.  No complex onboarding or complex policy-driven flows, just plain and easy-to-use Mobility Management Platform for every business. I look after the overall strategy, products, operations, customer support, hiring and partnerships for Scalefusion. ‍ The co-founder of Scalefusion is Arnab. He looks after the technical side of the product and is the CTO of the company.  ‍",," Being a bootstrapped startup, managing cash was always one of the biggest concerns. We started off by setting month-on-month goals to have a positive cash flow. This concern eased out gradually when we started creating a run-way for 3 months, 6 months. But we had to keep a tight leash on our spendings, and couldn't take exorbitant risks and tried to play it safe.  On the personal front, being an entrepreneur is a lonely journey. You don’t have too many people to talk to, get directions from. On some occasions, you question yourself. But you have to overcome them, pat yourself on the back when needed, since no one else can do it for you.  ‍  One of the greatest disadvantages was that both me and my co-founder did not have a solid idea on the business side of things. Both of us come from a technical background, we had to pretty much learn everything on our own, use the trial and error way. If we had a third founder from a business background, it would have helped us early on with the business.  I am waiting to create my worst mistake yet. ‍",," We believe in sustainable growth and that’s what we shall be focussing on- be it with respect to expanding our team or to building new features. In terms of revenue, we aim to grow 100% year-on-year. Our hiring will be organic, when the need arises, we will continue to grow our team.  On a personal level, the goal is to inspire more and more people among the team to build their own startups. Creating a working environment that instills the confidence amongst our team members to build something of their own is a personal goal for me.  ‍",," We started off by offering services in the kiosk technology and understanding what the market lacked in terms of the MDM industry. The growth of mobile devices in business is exponential and after having worked with multiple projects around the same lines, we saw a pattern. Although there were big players catering to the MDM market, we realized they were complex and pricey and had no focus on SMBs and their needs. We realized that we could scale our kiosk technology solution and that was our aha! moment.  The journey of Scalefusion (previously known as MobiLock) began from being a kiosk solution to a full-blown mobile device management platform. We published our MobiLock standalone Android App for free in the Play Store to test the market. Within the first 2 months, we hit more than 1000 downloads from 20+ countries, in the next 2 months, the number reached to 5000+ downloads and 35+ countries. We took the hint, the market was ready for us! The prime motivation was to build a world-class product, which the world will love to use, from India. Along with my team at ProMobi Technologies, we built a simple-to-use product that focussed on the features the customers needed. We began working on the admin dashboard and the integration between the dashboard and the app. After our initial dry-runs, we realized that our product worked just fine but the UI/UX was complex. Since our primary goal was to create an easy-to-use and clutter-free,  my Co-founder and CTO Arnab took a stance that the product was not really what we envisioned. Our team geared up and re-designed the entire product, launching the Beta Version of MobiLock Pro in January 2015, with a 30-day free trial.  After our three initial months from January to March, we invited our free app customers to try out our platform. By the end of March, we had 10 paying customers and in April, we got out of the Beta version. Then, our customer base started building up. We partnered with Samsung and LG for their enterprise SDK support, onboarded 4 resellers for Europe, APAC and the USA and by the end of November 2015, we had 120+ paying customers in 50+ countries, managing 50K+ devices. Our team grew from 1-2 part-timers to 8 in Jan 2015 and is now 70+ in 2020.  It was an exciting journey, especially since we focussed on offering free customer support. We focussed on positioning the product ideal for SMBs and that really worked for us. For pricing, we went with the folks who knew the best- our customers. One of our customers suggested 1 dollar per device per month, we tested it with our other clients and went ahead with it.  Since then, we have extended our offering to multiple OSs- Android, iOS, Windows 10 and macOS. We also started building a large feature-set to match the competition, and this created a little focus-shift- from customer-oriented to feature-oriented. But we quickly realized that this might be the wrong move, and reversed our product building strategy soon after.  One of the major hiccups, that we didn’t quite expect was when we rebranded in March 2019. We were aware that the rebranding activity would cause a temporary blip, but the estimated 3 months low-period was extended until the end of the 6th month. Although, in the end, I feel it was worth it!  ‍",," I started out my career working in a startup based out of Vizag, India called NetSavant. Working at NetSavant gave me the exposure, energy and the entire ‘vibe’ of a startup. This is where I was acquainted with the ups-and-downs of a startup ecosystem. I very soon realized that it resonated with my working style and consciously chose to work with startups. For the next decade, I worked for around 6 different startups- some that made it big, some that didn’t. I believe that my work experience at each one of them shaped me into my entrepreneurial journey.  Looking back, I am glad I chose to work in startups!   Right before Scalefusion, I was working on my first startup- QuadNode, which was founded in the year 2011. At QuadNode, my co-founders and I built three different products with varying degrees of failure. It was a great learning and very humbling experience indeed. As they say, you need to feel and know when it is not working to stop chasing that product and we did just that, when our third product failed to surface the market. During our time at QuadNode, we had spent considerable time studying, experimenting and building Kiosk Technology amongst several other ideas. Kiosk Technology, as I mentioned above is when businesses can take any smartphone, tablet or a laptop and make it run exclusively for business. Think web browsing laptops and tablets in airport lounges, self check-in devices at the airport and hotels, devices displaying audiovisual ads in waiting areas or wayfinders in zoos, museums and shopping malls and devices used in school where students can explore educational apps and nothing more.  ‍ We were deciding which was the one most worth pursuing and needed time, freedom and of course cash to chase our product ideas.  This is when we started out-sourced product development at ProMobi Technologies- the parent company of Scalefusion, to keep the money flowing in and this bought us some time to research more on the one idea that seemed the most promising- Kiosk technology. We offered specialized mobile device management services which also helped us to understand what the market really wanted- we started creating custom kiosk solutions for our clients considering their industry-specific needs and feature-demands. "," I don’t have any regrets. Only if I knew this idea would be as successful as it is today, I would have taken more chances upfront instead of spacing it out over a five-year period. I would have tried multiple things within the first three years itself. "," Our initial marketing and sales strategy were pretty straightforward. We started off by catering to SMBs. Our marketing strategy was inbound, since this ensures less customer education and quicker conversions. Our problem-product fit was well-oiled.  We focussed on building organic growth via SEO and simple, easy to understand content copy on our website, blog, etc. We also dig deep into geo-marketing targeting specific geographies that were more suited as our client.  Our customer support is one of our key offerings and it has proven to be particularly advantageous for our growth. One tactic that didn’t really work out for us was going after the mid-market and enterprise customers, too soon. After receiving considerable traction for SMBs, we started hitting the mid-market and enterprise customers but our product was just not ready then. And our ‘enterprisy’ copy overwhelmed SMBs, and scared them away too. But we soon realized this and reverted to what we knew the best and it has been amazing ever since."," To know more about me, you can have a quick glance here.

I grew up in San Jose, CA and I’ve been working in tech since Palm Treos were a thing (Google it, they were the smartphone to own before iPhones). This picture was taken on my birthday in my first cube from a Tungsten C. This is that HIGH resolution picture. More recently, I ran growth at Zinc.io (YC W14) and moved them from $1M to $100M in GMV in 2 years. I’m also a startup advisor at Bouncer (getbouncer.com, YC W18), Commsor (commsor.com, tools to measure your B2B community), Topic (usetopic.com, SEO tools to write for what ranks). ‍",,"  A common challenge I face is that there seems to be candy everywhere as most of my growth strategy is SEO based, so basically people who want to send postcards find me. This makes it harder to develop deeper expertise in a field and really KNOW my customer’s customers and what makes them tick… so I can provide meaningful help for them down the funnel. Sometimes it's been a challenge as well to collect money from clients. Nowadays, I don’t run any campaigns until I get paid upfront. Oh and once my printer forgot to charge me $10,000 and they came to collect a year later. So, that was fun. ‍  I've been a victim of the “sunk cost fallacy” plenty of times. I had this moment actually yesterday where I found an interesting approach to target solar people by creating landing pages for them and I thought “why don't you just run Facebook ads at these people?”. It sometimes makes you wonder if you’re too committed to the product vs the outcome.  Another mistake has been not letting people go quicker. There are people that I like working with, but who just don’t produce results (for whatever reason). It’s hard to let go of someone, but sometimes you just need to cut the cord. It’s both a big mistake and something I hate to do. ‍",," I really just want to be able to work with great people and build a brand that drives killer results for more and more customers. I don’t have an aggressive revenue goal, just focus on the things I can have more direct influence over like traffic, conversions, and most importantly those things that make my customers successful!",," On January 23rd, 2016, we began working on Scout Studio V1, which was an improved version of our internal tool.  Over the years, the product moved from a self-serve drag and drop tool to a fully fledged postcard editor with tracking per card, image and text personalization, unique maps, and tons more. For example, we’re working with solar companies to show pictures of people’s homes from space, including analysis on their roof done via machine learning. Here’s what they look like. While we built software for end users, I’m the main customer as the business has become more of an agency, which runs 100% of the campaigns for our clients. We’re opening up the tool now too, for folks who already know the channel and just need a way to simple send the cards. In terms of the company structure, it has also changed over time. Zach left the business for his baby and works on contract how, so I’m currently the only owner. I have an army of part-time people working with me. Among them, there’s a designer taking care of postcards and website stuff, a marketing person who manages the Scout community, a VP of accounts that manage existing clients, a guy who is an expert in the print field, and some engineers doing widget and data automation. Pricing has never been a big concern. I do it based on the value we provide to the customers. I have a whole sales process where I assess that value and once the customer pays, then I have to deliver that value. ‍",," One of the first companies I worked for was Palm, back in the days when a PDA meant Personal Digital Assistant, not Public Displays of Affection.  Here’s what mobile email looked like before the iPhone… you used a STYLUS to tap these buttons. I was there for 7 years and, while at Palm, I got two degrees in Political Science, including a Masters at the University of Columbia, Missouri. The idea after getting my Masters was to become a teacher. But, tech was where my heart was. I moved to San Francisco, worked at many failed startups--including one that raised almost 1B and doesn’t exist today. I always joke that I’m either fired or the company shutdowns and it’s about a 50/50 split. Basically, I was both a bad employee and also tired of working for companies that failed. I then joined a YC-backed startup called Zinc. I was their first hire and I had a lot of flexibility to do whatever I wanted. As the first non-founder hire, I helped the company grow from zero to hundreds of thousands per month, which made me realize it was pretty exciting to work at a company with product market fit where I had the flexibility to drive growth and be fully responsible for it. Back in 2014/2015, I started building some products with a friend who was a really good designer and engineer… Zach!  We first built a cool app called Sightings that allowed users:  Take a picture Send a link to someone The other person would get a distance, direction, and a compass Only when they arrived, the photo would unlock! Then we built another app called Pushpin that showed the best places to go nearby based on how great and how far they were. We were getting +100 organic downloads per day, but when we tried to monetize it, no one would pay for it. That’s when we realized that free apps suck. Just after that, we launched Cursive, a tool that created instant small business websites (like this one) with data extracted from APIs. But selling to small businesses was hard. We tried walking into their shops, emailing and calling them, but nothing worked. Then, we tried postcards. We wanted to send personalized postcards but there wasn’t a tool out to do this, so we created one. That’s when we thought “maybe some other businesses would like to send personalized postcards like these”. We spent a few weeks and built v1 of Scout and posted it to Product Hunt. We were the number  #2 product of the day and closed more revenue that day than the year we spent on Cursive. ",," This is a hard question. I believe that there’s a ton of luck in things, but I’d say that three things contributed: “I got a guy” channel: I’ve worked with many other marketing consultants and when a business tells them they want to carry out a postcard marketing campaign, they generally send them my way. Also, from marketing slack channels.(Programmatic) SEO: We’ve lately been focused a lot on SEO, particularly creating programmatic pages in different areas. For example, we have a glossary page which we launched a few weeks ago and now accounts for 4% of our traffic. We are also building a postcard example collection where we rate them and break them down. Lastly, we’re currently converting a spreadsheet we have found with a lot of information on solar installer companies in the US into different pages and we aim to rank when people Google these companies. This is just a public spreadsheet that I’m turning into pages. Plus, we have a YouTube channel, blog, a ton of postcard examples, and a glossary.Email: The key here is pain based targeting. I send really personalized emails with information about their company and calculations I do based on data I have. I saw a 22% positive reply rate. April 2020 was a great month for Scout. We closed $54k in deals with really good margins. ‍"," You can check my LinkedIn here.

213,scraper-api," Hi! My name is Zoltán Bettenbuk and I am the CTO at Scraper API. I am based in Eger, Hungary, with my family. Our business is headquartered in the USA but our team lives in a few different countries. Scraper API handles common obstacles that developers face when trying to extract data from websites at scale, such as CAPTCHAs and bot detection. This makes it easier for them to get any HTML they seek with just a simple “call” to our system. My role entails ensuring that everything on the technical side is in line with our customers and our product this includes ensuring our customer relationships run smoothly, hiring new team members, and consistently working on the product. Our goal is to make life easier for developers to scrape data without the obstacles that significantly lengthen the process. ",," The main obstacle for us was having to get familiar with the technology. As Scraper API was a mature company during the acquisition, we wanted to ensure we understood what had already been set in stone, and how to make any changes when taking over. A scraping platform is not a highly scalable CURL (client URL) library. The source code virtually has years of experience hardcoded into it, with evidence of all the living past of what customers have asked for over the years. Looking at it is like looking at the age lines of a tree. While it was challenging to get accustomed to the product, we had a 6-month transition period in which Dan guided us. As head of the engineering team, one always has to juggle between working on killing off technical debt, satisfying the daily needs of our customers, and delivering new features and improvements. That's a difficult task and I know we don't always manage to do it the right way. An obstacle that the team faced before the acquisition was with accounting Dan has mentioned it would have been ideal to have hired someone earlier on to take care of it. Cleaning up finances and migrating to a new charging system was key to starting 2021 with a stable product, and with big plans. ‍",," The team includes a marketing strategist, software engineers, other entrepreneurs, and investors. We’ve got Ian Kerins who has tons of industry knowledge and is in charge of marketing. We have Ian Williams, our senior engineer who was an original member of the Scraper API team before the acquisition, and who does the heavy lifting for our current team. And we have Tim, Tobias, and Ulrich who co-founded our parent company, SaaS.group. Tim and Ulrich are entrepreneurs and investors who’ve made a huge impact in Germany, and Tobias has had tons of startup experience in the country too. My teammates’ wealth of knowledge, interesting ideas, and kindness are unmatched and something I highly value.  I am happy to say that we are off to a great start with the changes we have been implementing! We are hoping to hire more employees this year, and hopefully, the Scraper API family will be able to continue to grow afterward. Most scraping companies and startups operate in the shadows because data scraping is still perceived negatively by many large sites (mainly the ones that are often being scraped). Scraper API is different. And especially since SaaS.group acquired it, we're focusing more and more on privacy-enabled scalable data retrieval. While we strongly believe that information publicly available on the Internet is free to scrape, we always try to ensure that people's private information is a no-go area. Our long-term plan is to transform into an enterprise-grade scraping service with all the required features and throughput that large companies depend on. ‍",," Dan Ni founded our business in 2018 but we acquired it last August. When he became a freelance developer after leaving Wall Street, he kept stumbling upon the same roadblocks in his web scraping jobs (such as setting up proxy servers and redistributing IP addresses). To overcome them, he created an API (application programming interface) that could write web scrapers with practically no setup. We decided to invest in Scraper API because we could see how promising it is as a web scraper that offers what similar products in our competitive market do not. It also fits into our “low-touch” SaaS category of businesses, as it’s built for most customers to purchase it without sustained one-on-one interaction with someone else, and has a customer success component that provides educational resources.",," Before investing time into Scraper API, I co-founded Fishbole (I am currently still the CTO there too) which is a flipped classroom cloud app for students and educators. It’s exciting because I’ve gotten to manage and coach the engineering team, design the technology stack, and always work closely with the other co-founders to ensure that our mission to build a flipped classroom app with an intuitive layout is realized. Before Fishbole, I worked for multinational companies such as LogMeIn, Dynata, and T-Systems as a manager, leading engineering and product teams. My team and I saw the potential that Scraper API has to do for web developers what Mailchimp does for email marketers, and that’s to streamline a process that can help them succeed in their industry.  ‍"," One of the biggest lessons I have learned from my time with Scraper API is that patience and a supportive team are vital to a successful acquisition and transition period. Even if you feel like you have all the information in the world about the business you’re acquiring, there are many unknowns and surprises to continuously work through. If you’re part of a great team everyone can help each other out, which helps everything come together faster. Luckily we took over the team too during the acquisition, and we could rely on their vast knowledge of the domain. Since I've mainly worked with enterprises in the past (LogMeIn, T-Systems...etc), a lesson I have also learned is that startups that got momentum early on have a lot of skeletons in the closet, that you have to either learn to live with or dedicate time to work through them. Scraping is a constant cat and mouse fight - it’s a bit similar to what advertisers and ad-blocker apps do. The technology we build is unbelievably advanced when it comes to staying on top of the newest blocking techniques the cat-mouse fight was a manual thing in the past, but we are building newer, more autonomous ways to stay unblocked."," Dan took care of the marketing internally when he founded Scraper API. He and the early team would regularly contact developer blogs for tutorials, and sponsor developer blogs and Youtube channels to spread the word about the tool. They also started our affiliate program. We had mostly relied on blog posts for new visitors and organic traffic. The early team had started to see traction with a blog post explaining the types of companies that use web scrapers. This continued with top-10 lists about different aspects of web scraping.  Now, we are prioritizing improving our marketing strategy - with help from outside contractors and further investment made in SEO, we hope that by reworking our website, we will create more unique pages that draw people in, and improve user experience. ‍", Here is my LinkedIn. We’ve got some great info about web scraping and related topics on our blog.," We use the CanIRank tool to help us with our SEO and to utilize its suggestions for ways to improve our inbound marketing efforts. Snip.ly is awesome for shortening links, and Prerender is a useful resource for introducing coding to our page that enables it to show up higher on search engine pages. Some books that are very important to me are Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager by Michael Lopp, Emotional Grit by Dr. Neeta F Bhushan, and Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug. Managing Humans is both hilarious and helpful for people who oversee teams, Emotional Grit helps me lead more compassionately, and Don’t Make Me Think is just a classic for developers that I enjoy going back to from time to time. ‍",,Software & Hardware,,United States,"April 13, 2021",Zoltán Bettenbuk,https://www.failory.com/interview/scraper-api,"['https://www.linkedin.com/in/zolt%C3%A1n-bettenbuk-95027927/', 'https://www.scraperapi.com/blog']",success,1,$100k-$500k/mo,"Zoltan is the CTO at SaaS.Group, a portfolio company of SaaS businesses.

214,scrapingbee," Hey! My name is Pierre de Wulf, I’m 27 and I live in Paris, France. 18 months ago I quit my full-time job as a data-engineer to go the indie hacker way with my lifelong friend, Kevin Sahin.  4 months ago, and after trying many many things, we built ScrapingBee, a web scraping API that handles proxy, chrome headless and captchas for you. Prior to this, we tried many different things and businesses, but I’ll talk about it later. ScrapingBee is particularly useful for people or companies who quickly needs to scrape the web at scale and who don’t want to spend too much time and energy handling this part but rather focusing on extracting value from this data. It might be someone that needs to aggregate some data for their next blog post about the aerospatial industry or a big company that needs to monitor thousands of restaurants’ reviews online. At first, our API only returned HTML of any URL you passed to it, but recently we’ve launched an API store that extracts structured data from specific services such as Instagram or Google. Both Kevin and I work full-time on this, and remotely. We both have 100% technical background and at first, we were both equally tackling marketing and product tasks. Lately, Kevin naturally took the lead on the sales/marketing and operational aspects of the business and I did on the tech/product side. ‍",," The first biggest misadventure so far we had with ScrapingBee was a legal one. Early on, ScrapingBee was called ScrapingNinja. We actually launched on ProductHunt with this name. 1 month after the PH launch we received an email from a French company claiming to own this name and asking us to change right away. This caused a lot of stress and made us lose a lot of time, and quite a bit of legal fees because we had to do a whole rebrand in less than one month. We had to say goodbye to all our SEO efforts, find a brand new name, do good legal research about it, find a new logo and communicate about it.  We are the only one to blame for that mistake, had we made more thorough brand name research before launching we would not have chosen ScrapingNinja. We will definitely not make this same mistake again. The second one was a motivation one, after working 8 months on PricingBot and seeing that nothing worked, we were really on the verge of quitting. We’ve known several people who were not able to give up a bad business idea soon enough and they ended up staying for as long as 5 years. One of our biggest fear was to be one of those people. On the other end, we knew that building a new business takes time and that you should not hope for overnight success because it almost never happens. So we were at the point where we did not know if we had to quit and we did not know if we had enough time to launch something else. We ended up building ScrapingBee because we knew we would never be sure of anything we’d better build something out of this uncertainty instead of just wondering. ‍  I’d say that our greatest disadvantage is that Kevin and I both have a full technical background. Neither of us has ever worked in web marketing before and we had to learn everything from the ground up. On the other hand, we’ve known each other for the last 15 years, so what we don’t have in complementarity, we like to think that we make up for it in terms of communication and getting along with each other very well. Secondly, we are completely bootstrapped, meaning that we can’t afford to waste money on costly experimentation. At least at the beginning, we had to be very careful about every one of our purchases. But as always, something good came out of this, because we could not afford to spend too much money we chose to get the maximum out of every tool we were already paying for, 80% of our business is now done solely with Notion and Slack and we learned a lot about the powerfulness of those tools. Now things are better, we had the chance to sell PricingBot last month, and in 2020 we will have much more money to spend. We can’t wait! I think that our biggest mistakes were made with PricingBot as explained before. I like to think that we did not make the same mistake twice with ScrapingBee. But right now, ScrapingBee is at a level we’ve never reached before with PricingBot, so we have lots of new mistakes to make, we just haven’t had enough time to make them yet. ‍",," As of right now, ScrapingBee has an MRR of $2900. It is a weird position where of course we can't say that this is a failure, but this is way too soon to talk about success. Our primary goal is to be able to make a living out of ScrapingBee, to reach ramen profitability as Paul Graham would say. We aim to reach this point as soon as possible. For us, it means reaching $5000. Our second goal is to really write many good pieces of content about web scraping and to finish our whole Python guide before the end of the year. We also want to seriously build a community around web scraping, we still don't know if we should do it on Linkedin or Facebook but we want to do it.  We also have an API store that we want to develop by supporting more and more websites, but we won't focus on this part before Q2 2020. We basically want to focus on as few things as possible and try to do them as correctly as possible. This is probably the most difficult part about running a business solo or with only one partner, there are just so many things we want to try and explore, but at the end of the day there are only 24 hours and we have to prioritize. So from now on, our focus will be solely on content marketing and building a community. On a more personal side, both Kevin and I want to prove ourselves that we made the right choice of leaving our company a few years ago. We’ve been reading about startup and indie hacking for the last 6 years and want to know that it was not done in vain. ",," When building the initial version of ScrapingBee we had to keep 2 important things in mind. First, the solution should be scalable and cost-efficient from day one. We are a 100% bootstrapped company and we could not afford to lose money. Secondly, we had to build ScrapingBee quickly, very quickly, our previous project PricingBot was not a success and we could not afford to spend another 9 months with 0 cash coming in. With that in mind, we used our knowledge and past experiences to make the most cost-efficient and time-efficient choice. We reused PricingBot web app code for the (light) front-end and billing management part of the app. We deployed the whole thing on Heroku, web application and database, the only thing we externalized was Redis as we needed lots of concurrent connexions and those were really really expensive on Heroku. Doing this allowed us to have a usable version in a few days.  But we had one big problem, we could not handle more than 10 concurrent connexions at that time without spending tons of money. The reason was that our API requests a URL through a real Chrome browser in order to be able to scrape web application with a lot of JavaScript. And those computations are really really CPU intensive. This led us to serverless, we basically deployed a Chrome headless on steroid on AWS lambda. We could now scale almost at will as AWS lambda authorize up to 1000 concurrent connections. The problem with AWS lambda is that it is crazy-expensive. To mitigate that aspect we paid the $750 Pro annual plan of ProductHunt's ship product to get $5000 of AWS credits. Of course, that solution would only work for some time but it left us enough time to build our custom scalable system. Regarding proxies, we mixed our own private pool of IP with several proxy providers from all around the world. The problem with proxy providers is that they are not all equal and knowing which one to trust is a challenge. That was it for our main product. For the landing page, thanks to Landen, a really nice landing page builder, it only took us 1 hour. Internally we used heavily Slack for all synchronous communication between Kevin and I and Notion as a Knowledge Base + CRM + Project management tool + Finance. Those two tools are really incredible by both their versatility and quality. ",," I think we can say that the whole ScrapingBee story actually began almost 3 years ago when Kevin and I decided to build this one fun side project together. I've known Kevin for the last 15 years as we were in the same high school and later in the same university. Early on he introduced me to the whole Startup and Indie Hacking ecosystem by showing me the website and books he loved. This piqued my interest and Kevin and I constantly talked about startup ideas we had. The thing was, we were only talking about or coding some small stuff here and there but we never really launched something. But three years ago, my girlfriend gave me an idea that I found interesting: a product that would allow you to save all the products you are interested in buying online in one place and get a notification once they are on sale. I really loved the idea, as always, I talked about this idea to Kevin and we decide to build it and this time we would not make the same mistakes we made with our previous and unfinished projects: We decided this time to use a boilerplate code so we did not have to deal with code login, email validation, user management, from scratch.We only implemented 2 important features: save the product from everywhere on the web with a Chrome extension and receive a notification once price drops.Even if the results are not perfect, launch anyway. At that time, I was working full time in Paris and Kevin was writing his book about Java web scraping. We built ShopToList in about 1 month, mainly during the weekend and decided to simply post it on three different subreddits and it blew off. I remember that this is 'r/frugalmalefashion', a subreddit dedicated to male fashion discount, that loved our ideas the best, we quickly reached 1000 upvotes and in about 4 hours we had almost 600 users. We were ecstatic, for the first time, we had built something people liked, but more importantly, something people used!  The next week was all about r/posting and some content marketing. We also did a ProductHunt launch that went well, especially considering the state of the app. Quickly we realized that while this app was probably a good idea, making a living out of it would be very difficult, and making a living out of our project was always the goal for us. It would be hard for mainly three reasons: The product needed to be free, so monetization would come from affiliation or ads and both solutions need a huge user base to be profitable. We estimated that we needed at least 100 active users to reach that point with ShopToList.ShopToList is a B2C app and customers are really used to incredibly well-polished app, and ShopToList was not. We knew that in order to build a successful app we would also need to build a mobile app and add many social features.The acquisition is really expensive and hard, especially in the free app B2C market where your marginal revenue per new user is almost 0.Many ShopToList clones existed or used to exist, and it really seemed that only a few of them were making money.   Three months after launch, we decided to put ShopToList on hold. Even if it was not a million-dollar project we considered it a success because it showed us that Kevin and I were both capable of working together and it gave us the confidence to build other products and projects and showing them to the world. Fast forward a few months, out of curiosity we look at ShopToList production database to understand our users. We wanted to know, on average, how many products people added, what was the most famous website... We quickly discovered that out of 3000 users, almost a dozen of them had added around 1000 products each! This was huge, especially considering the fact that we did not offer a way to 'bulk' add products in your account. We went into ""FBI mode"" and understood that those users were actually e-commerce owners who were monitoring their competitor's pricing. EUREKA we though with Kevin, why not build a price monitoring system? This idea seemed really good on paper for many reasons: It is way easier to make money with B2B than B2C.Many price monitoring tools existed, which means that there are consumers for it.Those tools were all very very complicated to use.We could leverage ShopToList users to find our first clients. We did things the usual way, we started with building a landing page, shared it on a dozen Facebook groups. We built an MVP in about 2 months and thanks to a successful PH launch we quickly managed to have 150 users for our free beta. In January, we decided to go out of beta and basically forced our customers to pay for the product if they still wanted to use it. I still perfectly remember that 10 minutes after sending this email, we had our first paying customers. Needless to say, things were looking great. The next following month we would try to get as many users as possible by testing different marketing strategies, mainly content marketing. Our main problem was conversion, it was very very low, approximately 1% (trial -> customer). From day one we knew marketing would be the key and that getting users to our website would be very challenging. But I think one of our mistakes was to overlook how hard it can be to transform a user into customers. We've tried many things to increase the conversion rate, we've rebuilt our onboarding, wrote tons of content, had many many calls and it was just not working. We saw three big reasons for that: We failed to explain the value of price monitoring. We did not know eCommerce very well and I think that this lack of knowledge played a key part in our failure explaining PricingBot value to our users.Onboarding was long and tedious as users had to match their products with their competitors. We offered to do it for a fee but no-one was ready to pay for this, see 1).We never knew who was our target. We never managed to understand what kind of e-commerce needed our tool: Was it a small e-commerce website? Was it drop shippers? Was it a niche website or not? We failed in finding our market. So basically it all came down to our lack of knowledge about e-commerce and e-merchant. In June, we saw that PricingBot would never have the success we hoped it had and we decided to launch something else. And now I’ll finally talk about ScrapingBee. Kevin and I are tech guys, we like to code and to build things. The common denominator of all our previous company work and side projects was web-scraping. We did a lot of it and saw many pain-points that needed to be addressed. Because we used to pay for one and that we were not happy with the product we decided to build an API that would handle headless browser, proxy, and CAPTCHAs for you. We thought it was a good idea because: Web scraping is a really competitive market, if you have doubts about it just type ""web scraping"" in Google and count the number of ads. It was a good sign because it meant there was a lot of demand for it.This time we knew who our customers would be and how to reach them.Because we knew a lot in scraping we had a lot to tell about it and we felt confident in our ability to explain the value of our product to our potential customers."," If I had the chance to talk about my 5 years ago self I think I would tell him not to do a price monitoring application, to begin your web scraping stuff as soon as possible AND to be really careful about brand names. I would also tell him to really do double-check his math correctly regarding ProductHunt launch. We actually launched on hour late and it cost us the “product of the day” place. "," Our strategy came down to this: we knew web scraping and the developer’s ""world"" very well, so let’s talk to them about web scraping. Of course, in the beginning, we posted ScrapingBee on dozens of startup listing website, but our core strategy was this. We put CTA on both our blog to redirect traffic to ScrapingBee and also wrote 3 very (from our point of view) successful piece of content, with each having more than 10,000 views: A small tutorial on how to scrape single page applicationAn extensive general guide about web scraping without getting blockedA complete introduction to web scraping with Python We don't believe in content marketing for the sake of content marketing. Sure it is easy to write or pay someone to do it for you, three pieces of content per week that nobody reads but that Google will love. We did not want to do that, we really believed we could teach something to our readers, and hopefully sell them ScrapingBee. This is why we almost spent 30 hours per article every time, it is time-consuming, but we think it is well worth it as it creates improves our SEO, brings huge traffic and builds our community.  One company we think that does it very well is Ahref. Of course, they have the resources to do those kinds of posts almost two times per week, but if you read their blog you will learn a lot about SEO, it is actually interesting and insightful content, not just marketing nonsense. We did not have the money to do Facebook or Google Ads, and if you type web scraping in Google and count the number of advertisements you can imagine how high the cost per click might be there. Instead, we massively discuss web scraping on Facebook, Reddit, Dev.to, Hacker News, and some more niche forums. We don't always bring up ScrapingBee, but when we do, it converts pretty well. "," If you are interested in web scraping, I sincerely think you should check out our blog. We really do our best to write interesting content and had really good results in it.

We will focus on that a lot in 2020."," Two books I’ve read really stood out those last two years: About marketing, I can’t recommend enough ""Traction"" by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares. What they basically say is that at the beginning, it is easy to lose a lot of time and energy trying every different acquisition channel (SEO, ads, content marketing, ...) out there. What you should do instead is find one channel that works well, or well enough, and stick with it to make the most out of it before exploring other solutions. We tried to do exactly that with ScrapingBee and it helped us tremendously. The second book that really helped me was ""Hello Startup"" by Yevgeniy Brikman. It's a technical book that explains all the things you should take care of, product-wise, to build maintainable and scalable product. I read it five years ago and learned a lot from it, especially for someone like me who, at that time, had never worked in a big company with a top-notch engineering team. Because it is hard to know what you don’t know, this book taught me a lot about critical parts in building application, (logs, feedback, cloud, CVS, …). I’d recommend this book only to people who have never worked in a tech company before.  About website, we’ve been IndieHackers users, readers, and contributors for most of the last 3 years and it really changed everything.  5 years ago I thought that in order to build a successful company you need to be a genius and have tons of money. How wrong was I. IndieHackers taught me most of the “startup wisdom” I currently “have”. I’ve recently been more involved in some facebook groups, such as “SaaS Growth Hack” and I am surprised how useful and “ad-free” the contribution is over there. I also learned to simply ask. Now, as soon as I see a fellow IndieHackers or even an entrepreneur doing things I am curious about, I just send them an email or even a LinkedIn message with my questions. So far I am at 100% response rate, people are very inclined to help each other, you just have to be respectful of their time (don’t ask them tons of things) and genuinely curious about them and their business.

215,scream-pretty," I am an ex-TV Producer, who once I had kids decided to start an ‘easy’ online business so that I could work from home and find that elusive work-life balance! Fail. My name is Lucy Lee, (43 years) based in Windsor, in the United Kingdom, Scream Pretty is my second jewellery brand after starting Lily Charmed in 2011. I no longer work from home and have a studio and 6 full-time staff, and numerous part-time staff, and have even dragged my husband and sister into the business too! My title in the business is ‘Director’ however I wear many hats, from designer, sales strategist, merchandiser, stylist, account manager, event manager and tea maker. We have a very collaborative approach - which means that we pull together as a team, to get the work done! In Summary - our business model for both Lily Charmed and Scream Pretty, is to design beautiful jewellery, and sell it via our websites and find resellers at trade shows to build the brands’ reach. ‍",," We are stretched and need more staff - and there aren’t enough hours in the day to run 2 business the way you would want. So, Scream Pretty is a little like a second child, that doesn't get as much attention as they deserve. I would love to find an extra day a week, or 2 more members of staff, then I feel I could get Scream Pretty in front of more people, as I think when people do find us, they like us and return - or buy gifts for their friends! As I run the business with my husband, we find that work life and family life often overlap, and our daughter (age 9) is the first to say dinner time is ‘family time’ not ‘work time’ as sometimes it is hard to leave work at work, especially as we also have a home office - and often work late into the night! Although as we do run our own business our children are lucky to have one of their parents at the school gates to pick them up each day! ‍  We were guilty of over ordering on designs we thought would fly but turned out not to be as commercial as we’d hoped, using up cash flow that could have been allocated elsewhere. We ordered gift boxes that had not been tested for tarnishing - and this caused issues for our trade customers, that had badly tarnish jewellery after short periods. NOT ideal! So, we had to find a new more reliable and quality box supplier - sometimes you just need to pay a little more, to save yourself time, and money in the long run! Here are our new and improved boxes! ‍",,," There are many, many, many jewellery brands out there, and trying to keep your ideas fresh, and your designs unique is tricky in a world where Google and Pinterest share every design idea across the world in seconds. We are ‘Screaming’ into a very populated and crowded market, so we need to learn how to Scream louder. As we only launched in 2016, we are not widely known, so we need word of mouth or a publicity ‘break’ to get us the recognition that could take us forward."," Scream Pretty was a side project for me, so I took my time building the look and feel on the Shopify store, and creating the right jewellery designs and imagery. There was no rush or agenda, as it was self-funded, and we had no investors wanting returns - a luxurious start really! It took about 2 years from initial idea to Scream Pretty going live. My sister and I worked on the designs, and finding the right ‘look and feel’, then had to find a manufacturer that suited the style and could also deliver the quality (and be ethical in their employment record), we used a talented cousin to design the Logo, and another to model for us, I worked on the website in my free time - and Shopify was an amazing platform for me to play on, with no tech knowledge, but lots of creativity! I love starting new projects, and starting Scream Pretty was a real buzz. The jewellery looked fantastic from the outset - although there were a few quality issues to be ironed out. Jewellery can be expensive, so we wanted to find a way of creating an affordable luxe brand, so you can treat yourself on payday, rather than having to save all year! Pricing is key to our success for both retail and trade customers. It means our margins aren't large on trade orders, but volume sales and repeat sales from these customers makes us see that we were right to keep trade margins low, so that retail customers get a good affordable price - and keep coming back for more. We launched the website using social media and sending one email to our Lily Charmed mailing list (they are very different customer groups). Our first promotion was to reward our first 100 customers with a 10% discount on the site, for life! On anything, even sale lines. We were disheartened at how slow traffic was to the site initially, as we are always looking for more traffic! We were using Facebook adverts, Instagram (daily) and Twitter. We were so proud of the site we expected a flood of visitors - but got a trickle. The conversion rate on the site is high 33.5% in the last month (May 2018) - so when a customer is finding us, they already have the incentive to buy, having generally come to our site from @screamprettystyle Instagram 81%. So, we are still working on ways to push more traffic towards Scream Pretty. ‍",," Before Scream Pretty, I was, and still am, running a successful Jewellery business, Lily Charmed - but the focus of Lily Charmed was on sentimental, gifting charm jewellery and I wanted to flex my designer muscles (Along with my sister Jessica on the left of the photo below), and work on edgier more fashion-led design. This was the inspiration behind Scream Pretty. Before starting in e-commerce, I was a TV and Event Producer - which is a great job - you discover, that with research and hard graft you can become an ‘expert’ in almost anything. I had already tried to start a business. pitching TV show ideas to big Channels in my twenties - turns out they all had ideas ‘just like mine’ in development already! (exhausting) so I decided this wasn’t a business model to continue with. As I’d already tried running a business, setting up another when I had two very small children seemed like a great idea, I could work from home and look after them too. I had a business partner who was already running jewellery shops, so had contacts and knowledge, so starting an online jewellery business seemed an easy step - even though I had NO experience selling online. Sadly, after working for free for two years building and creating a profitable business, Lily Charmed, my business partner decided that he wanted out, and asked for a vast sum of money for me to ‘buy him out’ or split the business (we had created 2 brand names by that point) as I couldn't afford to buy him out - we had to split the business, and I felt very bruised by the whole event. With hindsight though, this backward step, as I saw it then, was the launch-pad to grow Lily Charmed in ways that my previous partner wouldn't (we are now in the largest UK jewellery chain, and exporting to China), and it gave the scope, finances and creative space to launch a brand-new site Scream Pretty. ‍"," If I could give myself a big talking to, I possibly would have delayed starting Scream Pretty until my children were older, as I feel my work life balance is a little work heavy BUT, I love it, so maybe I wouldn’t have listened! I would also have tried to find a PR agency to help me place my jewellery into the hands of stylists so that we could get more coverage in the press, to boost our initial launch. We have found doing pop up shops a great way of testing our designs, before launching them on the website and incurring the cost of photography and uploading. I wish we had done more pop up shops prior to the launch, then some designs wouldn't have made the final cut. I would highly recommend this route for all e-commerce channels - if your customer doesn't like a product, don’t move forward with it! ‍"," We have worked with influencers on Instagram and are keen to do more. Our collaboration with Sammi Jefcoate, brought us many more followers and sales of our Starburst Hoop Earrings and Opal Huggies, that she wore in her Instagram posts. We have also worked with other Instagrammers, which seems to have gained us followers and traffic, but not all of the effort put in can be seen in sales for each and every post. We also found that one of our blog posts about the #curatedear drove lots of US traffic to our site, so we will be writing more niche blogs about jewellery styling. We have grown the trade side of the business substantially, by doing the trade show circuit in London, and every trade customer has now re-ordered, which we find really encouraging. And this helps drive awareness of the brand, and people who purchase a Scream Pretty item, often have a look at our website, but have the luxury of touching the item, when they buy it from a boutique! We have found that curated, London fashion boutiques have just the right ‘Scream Pretty’ customers - which makes us think we should be looking at a similar type of store in New York next year perhaps…. Facebook adverts - so far have not really worked for us - perhaps we haven't found the right ‘audience’, but we will keep trying. ‍"," You can visit our website, Instagram or Facebook!"," I read forums on Shopify Facebook groups for helpful advice, and also love reading blogs (mostly by Shopify) on tops and tricks to expand your business. But for me - I learn from my mistakes, and just throw myself into things - and this approach seems to have worked so far. ‍",,e-Commerce,,United Kingdom,"February 21, 2019",Lucy Lee,https://www.failory.com/interview/scream-pretty,"['https://screampretty.com/', 'https://www.instagram.com/screamprettystyle/', 'https://www.facebook.com/screampretty/']",success,1,No Data,"Lucy Lee is an ex-TV Producer, who once she had kids decided to start an online business.

216,seomator," Hi there, I’m Nick Sawinyh, one of the two founders of Seomator. I started my career as a network administrator in a local ISP company, where I met my business partner Eugene. Honestly, we just had three drinks together and found out we both were snowboarders and crazy chillers :) Then, we both worked for several years in the field of engineering and web products. Since we were very young, smart, and active, we started a couple of online businesses at the same time, which were successfully sold. Alongside this, we came up with an idea to serve the brand-new online service and worked on that for one and a half years until beta Seomator was launched. Whether you’re a freelance marketer or a marketing agency, Seomator will do the job for you and make your life easier. Right now we make about $4k MRR, and we are slowly growing. Here are our stats from Profitwell: ‍",," We’d built web projects previously, but Seomator was our first Saas and our first project with a fully remote team. So we made a lot of mistakes. I mean really a lot of them, and they were generally costly. For example, we spent a significant amount of time and money working on product localizations but realized later that keeping several languages up to date would cost us even more. And reaching those new markets wasn't bringing us enough customers to make it profitable. We also wanted to have both Stripe and Paypal as payment processing providers and spent near nine months building our own billing backend on the top of the Stripe and Paypal API’s. After nine months, we just trashed that code and went with Chargebee, which offered all the features we needed.  Dealing with remote developers was also a new beast. We had a full-time senior software developer on our team and a bunch of freelancers from all over the world working on various parts of our product. Obviously, we ended up dealing with all possible problems with freelancers: missed deadlines, bad code, overestimated work hours, developers disappearing when we needed to fix a critical bug, and so on and so on. We started using Hubstaff for employee time tracking and it did the trick.  ‍",,,," Using our team and the sources we already had from our previous projects, Eugene and I started with a description of all the parameters that had to be checked for any website’s SEO improvement and recommendations we might give based on that. When we were looking for right tech stack, we decide to go with good old PHP, since we have developers and previous experience. Also worth to mention that PHP developers are pretty common at freelance sites so you won’t have a shortage on a workforce.   Beta Seomator was launched in May 2014 and has Full Audit Report combined with Embedded Tool and Domain Comparison as options. For two or three months we offered the tool just a trial and started to sell it during Fall 2014. We began to engage mentors and influencers who gave us useful bits of advice and helped Seomator to come into SEO world. Our turning point was probably when we got the right product-market fit and were featured in world-famous Brian Dean’s SEO Tools List: ‍",," Since we had to create websites for our businesses and as young professionals didn’t have enough money to cover all the expenses for high-quality services, I studied and handled web design and SEO on my own. It was 2006 and it was a lot easier than nowadays. Later, I founded a SEO agency as a side business venture and was sold in 2015. Believe it or not, from the very beginning of our collaboration with Evgeny we always stashed two or three ideas we could turn into services. Working on a task, we see where and how to optimize or automate a process or how to use knowledge or data we own. With Seomator, I was working on my customers’ websites’ SEO and was wondering how to place SEO Analysis basis rails. As a result, Eugene and I thought why not start a tool that would check and show site owners all the weaknesses of and ways to improve their websites. There are two popular types of SEO Audit Tools on the market right now: SEO Graders such as Woorank, Nibbler, and Mysiteauditor that give you some basic “insides” based on one crawled URL (homepage usually) and SEO Crawlers like Screaming Frog, Deepcrawl, Onpage, and Botify that crawl the whole website and provide results, but usually to figure out something from their reports, you have to understand how SEO works and what you’ll need to do to fix issues.  We are somewhere in between full-scale crawlers and SEO graders we crawl up to 1000 pages from the website and then provide a list of SEO Issues backed with crawl data and detailed information and How-to-Fix tips. What makes us different from our competitors is our absolute focus on the automation of the SEO Audit Reports. We are also proud to be more affordable than most of the other services out there. In 2013, I was working on SEO for a couple of my customers and realized I didn't want to do the same job over and over. I wanted some service to do it for me. I investigated existing tools and found that I wanted something different from them. Tools like SEOptimer, ZadroWeb, or MySiteAuditor provide a quick analysis of your website and give you suggestions on how you can take your SEO up another notch. If you’re looking for something a little more in-depth and technical, without breaking the bank, then Seomator is the right tool. We have Embedded SEO Audit Widget to help SEO Agencies with new sales. Also, you might find a useful Monitoring alert tool to track all changes with a particular website. We offer a free trial you can test out, or you can sign up for a one-time report."," I wish we had focused on the marketing of our product earlier. We spent way too much time trying to find product-market fit, building features that never gained enough traction. Everyone keeps saying that SaaS founders should talk to users daily while looking for product-market fit, but I would say you have to talk with your paying customers if you already have them, not with users who just haven't started a trial or churned in a few days. What did your paying customers find useful in your product? How do they use your product? SEO tools are a very competitive market, and if someone is telling you that your product is missing few features, most likely even if you build those features they will never pay for a subscription anyway. Be aware of tire kickers requesting features! For example, we’ve built an API for Seomator and it took a bunch of time and money in development and product support, but very few customers are using it. If I had a chance to do things differently, I would cut out a lot of features that we’ve built into our product. ‍"," We did a lot of marketing efforts after our first MVP launch. I wish we had started doing them earlier. For us, SEO and content marketing works best we ranked pretty well for a bunch of our target keywords and managed to get a lot of backlinks over the years: The most successful link-building strategy was to give away for free our top-tier subscription to bloggers and influencers in exchange for Seomator mention. It worked pretty well. Another interesting thing was when we launched an affiliate program. It didn't bring us a lot of paying customers but it significantly helped us with link building. We run our affiliate program on Tapfiliate, a very flexible affiliate management platform suitable for SaaS recurring payments that also easily integrates with our payment processing provider. We’ve also tried advertising on social media and Google AdWords, but the cost of acquisition was too high for us.  It’s worth mentioning that along the road, we’ve built a few side projects to support our SEO, most notably Curatedseotools, a list of the best SEO tools, which was a big success at ProductHunt back in the day: The most important thing is that since our marketing strategy is built mostly on SEO efforts, our current monthly marketing expenses are very low and our user acquisition cost is near $0.  With all that efforts we have about 600-700 leads each month, with conversion to trials near 10%."," Visit our website, follow me on Twitter (@sawinyh) or connect on LinkedIn."," I would recommend stopping learning and starting doing. I’ve seen a lot of people looking for sacred knowledge, spending hours listening to podcasts and attending every single startup meetup in town, but never touching their own product.

217,sharkius, Hi everyone. Who are you... Wow! That is a tough first question that requires some introspection. Let's just say I am a 30-year-old serial creator of tech products who has many interests. I am currently working on an ed-tech startup called Chessable. We intend to make learning chess as easy as can be.  ," I think of it as the world’s most expensive MBA education. The amount of money I invested (from revenues) to grow Sharkius is considerable. Making such relatively high profile mistakes is difficult for anyone, and it gets imprinted in your brain forever. This can be a good thing though it means that for the rest of your life whenever you are close to making the same mistakes, your amygdala will start burning-up and remind you not to go there! You can build on this and become a better entrepreneur and person. Thus, making mistakes is good, make them early, pick yourself back up and try to reach even higher than you did before.  ",," Facebook was large enough, and the amount of competition had not yet saturated the market. Initially, there was room for everyone. If you can identify a new and growing market, it is like a Gold Rush. Lesson: be early to the party.  ",," I can think of many…! I will try to focus on the three biggest ones. First, the lack of experience at marketing hurt us. After the Facebook changes, we needed to do things like buy installs, buy re-engagement ads, e-mail our users. As the market saturated, “if you build it they will come” became a fantasy. We did not even have an e-mail list and couldn't reach our previous customers. An e-mail list could have saved us. If you do not need one now, you might need one later and regret not having it. Back it up, protect it. Save it. On that topic… time to make a fresh backup! Second, I would say the lack of a culture of learning. This manifested itself in many ways. I only got interested in reading personal development and business books a few years into my career. I should have been doing A LOT more reading. Learning from other people’s failures is much easier than learning from your own. It hurts a lot less. This is why I think Failory is a neat idea. The startup itself could have done a bit more learning we did not spend enough time iterating and split-testing as we should have. Finally, I think another serious mistake is working in the startup, and not working on the startup. It is very easy to be absorbed on the daily backlog of tasks you have, without ever stepping back and asking: is this the most important thing I could be working on? When you take a step back, it is easier to identify pressing problems and remind yourself to prioritise them.",,," Sharkius was a social games company that I started back in 2007. There were a couple of things that motivated me to start it. I had played many video games throughout my teenage years and always wanted to work in the industry. I was just about to finish my Bachelor's in Computer Science and wanted a head-start. I had made games before university from about the age of 14 some had thousands of users, some had none. Making games, seemed a natural thing to continue doing. Around 2007 Facebook was starting to experience huge growth, and they invited developers onto their platform. I saw this as the perfect opportunity for my indie games to reach a bigger audience.    The problems started a few years down the line. I think my most obvious mistake was the lack of realisation that my experience making good games would not translate well to investing into a team that made good games. Some of the guys I worked with were great people and great developers, but unlike other studios, we were not following a tried and tested formula that could be replicated. We stumbled. Having such game studios was better left to experienced investors with deeper pockets. We grew too fast, too quickly. We did not stay lean. Running a team has so much more complexities than a single person project. I made mistakes in people management, hiring too fast, firing too slow. I made mistakes in project management, and on and on! The inexperience showed at many levels. I was young and over-confident to the extent I was no longer on planet earth. Success had launched me far into space when I needed to keep my feet firmly on the ground. While I do think I got better at the job with time, at the same time, something big was happening. Facebook had grown so much and received so much attention that we were now competing with companies funded with $2-$5M in capital. We had some great ideas, but they had the better execution. Facebook took notice and all of a sudden the platform for engagement and growth became more and more closed. Sudden Facebook changes like closing the notifications channel and reducing feed exposure meant that our traffic dropped to a fraction of what it used to be.  "," Well, I have indeed started over but with a different product! I am doing many things differently, in particular, I am paying a lot more attention to the three points above. If I had a chance to go back in time and work on Sharkius again, I think this would have made all the difference. Other things that I have now done differently that should apply to any startup: Find a co-founder as early as you can. Co-founders can make a huge difference. It took a while for Sharkius to have someone who basically became a co-founder, he was great but it was a bit too late. At Chessable, this was arranged before day 1! This is why some accelerators and investors do not invest unless there are two of you. You should also get a more experienced entrepreneur to be your advisor and mentor. This way, you are accountable to someone else other than yourself. If anything else, knowing you have to meet with them keeps you working at the best of your ability.  "," The first year was incredible! It went from strength to strength. At one point I was making more money in a day than my dad could in a month. It was crazy.                                       I built a few social games inspired by games I had enjoyed in my earlier years. Facebook was creating a new market of gamers who had never played ""proper"" games before. Text-based games were a whole new world to them. The biggest hit we had was a city building simulator called Metropolis. At the end of the first year, we had revenues of $60-$80k per month. Regarding marketing, I was not great at marketing. I did not need to be. The games were compelling enough, and Facebook was a platform for discovery and engagement. Just by being on Facebook, we gained significant traction. It got me believing that “if you build they will come”. My later experiences and the book Traction by Gabriel Weinberg disprove this saying."," There is a good interview I did on Indie Hackers that has more on my current startup and the things we are doing right. I also blog (not often enough) here, I tweet (a bit more often) at @simplydt and I work, every day, with tons of passion on Chessable."," There are so many books that I would recommend. Can I have at least 3? Founders at Work, The Lean Startup, and just one more… Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me). I think these should give anyone a solid foundation for entrepreneurship. The last one, in particular, should be read by everyone as a crash course on the psychology of the self.  ",,Entertainment,Bad Marketing,United Kingdom,"March 17, 2018",David Kramaley,https://www.failory.com/interview/sharkius,"['https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/chessable', 'http://davidkramaley.com/', 'http://twitter.com/simplydt', 'http://www.chessable.com/']",failure,0,,"Sharkius was a social games company.

218,siempo," Andrew Murray Dunn here. I am a Chief Ethics Officer for hire, 31, living in the New York area. My mission is to bring ethics and eros into business. I do this through studying, writing, participatory art, coaching, and consulting with early-stage founders and professionals.  Siempo, Inc. was a Public Benefit Corporation whose mission was to create technology that protected and promoted human thriving. We built the first humane smartphone interface. I served as Operations Manager during the 2016-2017 hardware phase and CEO during the 2017-2020 software phase. "," We released our Alpha in December 2017 and launched our Beta in the Play Store in March 2018 to a flurry of positive reception: TechCrunch, Broadcast TV, endorsements and awards, stellar ratings, and reviews. It felt like we had timed the cultural moment perfectly. Yet we struggled to fundraise what we needed to take the following steps forward, in part due to Apple and Google’s announcement of their respective Screen Time and Wellbeing efforts, which spooked investors. The digital wellness space was still too early, too inhibited by the giants, too mission-driven. We paused operations for the summer. Given the historical moment we found ourselves in, I wondered if we had to innovate on the HOW and the WHAT to become a trusted and ethical product and organization. If we were going to take another crack at it, we had to find greater alignment across all dimensions of our business — from open source to Public Benefit Corporation to community funding. We had to make an organizational and cultural overhaul. We rebuilt a phenomenal team (ex-Apple, Space X, BCG) and updated our vision to reintroduce Siempo to the world as the first full-stack humane startup (in terms of product and org) through a June 2019 WeFunder equity crowdfunding campaign. Days before the planned launch, with nearly a dozen people involved, we experienced some unexpected roadblocks and decided to delay it to September. We took the summer to bolster our offering and explore a compelling B2B model but ultimately never launched the campaign due to a combination of burnout and continued lack of resonance with more prominent investors. Things were still not in flow. We left no stone unturned in finding new leadership or a larger organization to join forces with. In 2020 we made the difficult choice to dissolve the company.  • Platform —The inability to build Siempo on iOS was one of the biggest thorns on our side, as most investors have iPhones, as does half the US and a quarter of the world. Even though we enjoyed more creative freedom on Android, there were still limitations and risks, e.g., we had to water down our notification batching feature due to an OS update. Most of our features were first for Android, while impossible on iOS. • Coherence — Building trust and shared reality between remote culture and a mix of full and part-time contributors was challenging. It may have been more effective for new-to-the-world innovation to have a strategy, product, and engineering in the same room, on a learning journey together. We also never had an experienced CEO leading the team. • Fundraising — There’s no other activity we put so much time in that yielded so little result. We overestimated how investment appetite would match the growing cultural dialogue and how many investors would come out of the woodwork after making fortunes from tech and getting into wellness culture. Perhaps a nonprofit container might have been more appropriate. Here is the final deck for reference. • Timing — We got into the space very early. Even with The Social Dilemma viewed by hundreds of millions of people, the digital wellness industry still feels nascent, as evidenced by how many efforts have fizzled out and the ~dozen minimalist launchers that came after Siempo yet to crack the 1M download milestone.",,,,," The early team began hacking with hardware engineers and industrial designers on a new flip phone version. It included must-have features like cloud-synced notes and WiFi tethering that would make it easier for folks to ditch their smartphone (similar to The Light Phone and Mudita). They ran into the hurdles of building hardware from scratch. They eventually pivoted to white-labeling a current Android device and focused on designing a more conscious user experience on the software side. Mayank Saxena (part-time CTO) and I (operations and marketing) joined the team in the summer of 2016 with similar visions around disconnecting from technology. We progressed on the manufacturing and software design paths while gearing up for a crowdfunding campaign to launch our brand and pre-sell devices. We launched the Kickstarter in March 2017, raised $50k in device sales, and received countless press mentions but did not feel empowered enough to move forward with our manufacturing partner. The feedback was clear that the switching costs for a new device were high, and each user had a different idea of essential features. However, our audience indicated a strong willingness to try and pay for a software version of Siempo on their current device, which the Android operating system supports (this type of product is called a launcher, home screen, or lightweight OS). While Andreas and Jorge decided to move on to different projects, Mayank and I felt energized to explore the software path. With the support of backers, we were able to spin up operations again and bring on a product designer to help us design a more intentional smartphone interface. "," PR was our #1 driver of growth, though expensive when we paid for it and time-intensive when we did it ourselves. I think we missed a significant opportunity to invest resources into community building — a weekly Zoom with users could have gone a long way. While we wanted to keep the app free while in Beta, I wish we had experimented with charging for the product. Participating in an emerging industry presented a ripe context to network with diverse communities. Some of these explorations led to tangible outcomes (creation of Digital Wellness Collective industry trade association, volunteer support from users/fans, in-person meeting with Google and Samsung execs), while others led to distraction and overwhelm (creating an angel group for fundraising). "," Before hacking on a wearable idea to solve smartphone addiction, I studied business in college and worked at several early-stage startups. While pitching that idea at a meetup, I crossed paths with a team working on a mindful phone. Andreas Gala and Jorge Selva met through their partners in Chicago in 2014, connecting over life and business and curiosity about having a more balanced relationship with technology. Jorge had switched to a flip phone on business trips to South America and enjoyed the break from all the noise, while Andreas felt corporate burnout pains in testing lots of smartphones as a product manager at Yahoo.  "," I wrote a blog post outlining my vision for the next Siempo, detailing all the things we might do differently. On the product side: • Research — We conducted several rounds of user research, but we always could have done more to validate real human needs vs. what we imagined would be supportive. This is tricky for a problem with such a complex system of root causes. It has to do with the user’s awareness of their emotional state and their digital environment. • Simplicity — Because we initially set out to build a whole new phone, we had thought through many aspects of the user experience at the OS level. When we pivoted to software, we transferred much of that feature set into the launcher. A more straightforward feature set may have been more effective for user adoption than the complex set we released. • Onboarding — There is a big learning curve for switching to a whole new interface, especially for those who have never used a launcher before. We prioritized investing in a smooth onboarding experience, but it proved insufficient and led to a loss of many users upon download. There was ample low-hanging fruit to tackle to improve retention. ‍",, Postmortem blog postVision blog postSubstackPersonal Website, Zebras UniteThe Effective Choice15 Commitments of Conscious LeadershipThe More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know Is PossibleThe Listening Society , Siempo raised approximately $1.1M over four years and did not generate revenue. ‍,Health,Bad Market Fit,United States,"September 21, 2021",Andrew Murray,https://www.failory.com/interview/siempo,"['https://aandrewdunn.medium.com/postmortem-for-siempo-a-humane-tech-startup-%EF%B8%8F-62ef61832df0', 'https://aandrewdunn.medium.com/vision-for-the-next-siempo-a20e9d922ab8', 'https://avrahome.substack.com/', 'https://www.andrewmurraydunn.com/b42b77fe41134a7793401482ed466d9f']",failure,0,,"Andrew and his team built Siempo, a smartphone interface designed to support mental health and wellbeing.

219,simplelogin," Hey! My name is Son - 34 years old. I'm the founder of SimpleLogin, an open-source service to protect our privacy via email aliases. Currently, at $3000 MRR SaaS, our revenue continues to grow steadily.  Our team is based in France. At the moment I’m mostly focused on the backend and started to learn about the marketing/communication side. Our business model is based on subscriptions - $30/year or $3/month. There’s also a free tier that should be enough for most users. The project is fully bootstrapped and we haven’t taken any investment.  ‍",," One challenge SimpleLogin faced until now is the comparison with a very similar service that was launched just before us. Both products share a lot in common. It’s just tiring for us to be constantly compared, especially when SimpleLogin is still in beta. Now it becomes clear that SimpleLogin isn’t a copycat and offers a different set of features so the comparison is less frequent. The biggest mistake I made was to spend too much time building the single sign-on service without taking enough time to talk with app owners - those who would add our button in their apps. This is a classical mistake where the idea seemed so brilliant to us that it was hard to question it. Our biggest challenge at the moment is to explain why our product is needed. Most people consider privacy-focused products as difficult to use and are not willing to give them a try. Password managers had the same issue back then and hopefully, email aliases will become more mainstream in the future. ‍",," Today we have stable but not explosive growth. Our MRR is at around $3000/month and we are going to hit the 1000 subscriber milestone soon. We don’t have any intention to go big (or go home) - I like to keep the growth in control. At the moment, I’m looking for a partner who can take care of the marketing/communication side so I can focus 100% on the product/tech. Not a lot of marketing folks know about the privacy field so please ping me if you know someone who might be interested :). We also started to study how to make a similar product for credit cards and phone numbers. These are not easy as they are country-specific so we are going to probably target a specific country/region in the first version. ‍",," In the beginning, I was obsessed with the idea of creating a single sign-on button (think “Login with Facebook” but does respect your privacy) that created a different email every time you used it. I worked day and night on this idea and was finally able to create an identity provider that fully supported OAuth2/OpenID Connect, the standard for single sign-on providers. Then in June 2019, Apple released the “Sign in with Apple” in WWDC 2019 which was basically the same product. When I saw the announcement, I didn’t know what I should feel. Competing with Apple is hard, especially when Apple has the power to force every app to implement its login button. At the same time, this is market validation: a login button that protects our email address is much needed and that’s why Apple takes a direct fight against Facebook, Google, Twitter.  As time moves on, it becomes obvious that becoming an identity provider is a chicken-and-egg problem: without a lot of apps adding our button, people wouldn’t know about SimpleLogin and without a lot of users, no app would want to add our button. I decided to do a pivot: focusing on the email part and putting the single sign-on on hold.  Since the beginning, SimpleLogin has been fully open-source. It seems scary at first as anyone can just “steal” your code but it turns out to be one of the best decisions I made. Without being transparent, I wouldn’t have received valuable feedback from early-adopters, those who believe in the product and were willing to spend a lot of their time helping out! Later on, 3 more people joined the project on a part-time basis. We made iOS/Android apps, Chrome/Firefox extensions, created the landing page, etc. The server part was also greatly improved so it can be self-hosted along with advanced features like PGP, WebAuthn, etc. And because the code is open-source, some features are actually created by our users. I launched via different websites (HackerNews, BetaPage, etc) but these were never a real success. I guess the product wasn’t explained well enough or the timing was bad. Our growth is until now organic and mostly via word-of-mouth. As we offer the premium plan to students for free, it’s possible that they have helped spread the word. But I’ve never verified this hypothesis :). The pricing is kept extremely simple: the free plan should be enough for basic use and the premium plan is for advanced use. Both plans have no limit in terms of bandwidth or number of forwarded emails: everyone should be able to protect their email address for free. ‍",," I never cared much about my privacy because, like most people, I have nothing to hide. Last year I watched the Edward Snowden movie (that I strongly recommend) and realized that privacy actually matters and its effect is more concrete than I thought. If we don’t take our privacy seriously, we are going to be manipulated by big companies and politicians. And don’t count on the government to protect our privacy - even if you live in Europe. As a heavy Gmail user, I realized that my Gmail has become my online identity. In order to not be tracked, I need to have as many identities as possible and why not a different identity for each website. SimpleLogin is then created as a solution to easily create a different identity. I have started several adventures in the past but never felt enough motivation or the need to focus 100% of my time. But for SimpleLogin, for the first time several conditions were met: 1) This is a product that I use every day 2) The market potential is big (password managers like Dashlane and 1Password have recently raised more than $100M) - more people care about their privacy 3) It’s technically complex - as a developer, I get bored if there’s no tech challenge. I decided then to quit my job at the time to focus on SimpleLogin. This wasn’t an easy decision: I was leading a software team back then, was well paid, and loved the people there. By that time, I was very impressed by some companies who favor transparency and high ethical standards like Basecamp, Sentry, and Baremetrics, and set out to build SimpleLogin based on these principles."," My main takeaway since starting SimpleLogin has been to focus on the product and don’t rush it. Release early is good but there’s a line between viable (as in MVP) and unusable.  You probably heard that already a thousand times but let me repeat it: talk with customers. That’s the only way to learn how people use the product and improve it. One way to get in touch with users is to send transactional emails from a real address (and not a no-reply one) so anyone can just reply to talk with you.  Another lesson I learned is to ignore haters. There are always people who somehow hate you and your product so much. Ignore those, don’t fight back, and just move on.  I’ve been extremely lucky to have people around who don’t care or understand about SimpleLogin but are willing to support me nonetheless. Having support is important as there were low moments where it felt there was no outcome for the product.  ‍"," Being a beginner in marketing/communication, I’ve been focused on the only thing I know which is content writing, and have tried to write as much as I can about the findings when working on SimpleLogin or technical challenges. These posts are quite technical and targeted at tech-savvy people. In the beginning, I posted on dev.to (a developer-focus blogging platform), then I moved to our own blog. Some users suggested we get in touch with “influencers” in the field of online privacy. I did and SimpleLogin received highly positive reviews from Techlore (100K subscribers on Youtube), Michael Bazzell (author on security/privacy books), etc. These podcasts, videos, or blog posts generated traction and we can see the traffic peaking at the publication.  Currently, we are experimenting with a referral program. The result seems promising. We don’t have any traction when launching a Hacker News show post - I don’t have any explanation because similar products have acquired a lot of interest from this community in the past. I guess the timing of the post matters a lot and my advice is to make sure to delete your post immediately when you don’t see any upvote in the next 15-30 minutes. This way you can choose another moment to launch. We plan to launch on Product Hunt soon. Hopefully, it’s going to be better than the HN one."," If you’re new to email aliases and want to try out SimpleLogin, I’d recommend starting with our Chrome/Firefox extension - they are easy to use and handful when you sign up for a lot of newsletters or try out different software.  We are quite active on Twitter and Reddit so feel free to follow if you want to receive our latest updates."," For taking payments, I recommend using Paddle if you want to target the global market. TVA-compliancy is hard and it takes a lot of time to do that right. Paddle takes more commission than Stripe but 10% of revenue at the beginning doesn’t make much difference. Their documentation is also inferior than Stripe but fortunately, there isn’t much to do in terms of integration. Ping me if you need any help integrating Paddle. If your product targets a nid, make sure to spend enough time on the related Reddit community (aka subreddit). You will learn a lot about your potential users, the terminology they use, what they care about, etc. You can also ask them for feedback on an early version - just make sure to be sincere and don’t try to convert people to paying customers at that point. If they like your product, they’ll be willing to pay. I prefer Reddit at the beginning than Twitter as the Reddit community seems to be more constructive.  ‍",,Software & Hardware,,France,"December 31, 2020",Son NK,https://www.failory.com/interview/simplelogin,"['https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dphilobhebphkdjbpfohgikllaljmgbn', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/simplelogin/', 'https://twitter.com/simple_login', 'https://reddit.com/r/Simplelogin/']",success,1,$0-$10k/mo,"After watching Edward Snowden’s movie, Son began to care more about his privacy.

220,singulution," My name is Hunt Burdick and I live in El Paso, Texas. My first introduction to programming was at the age of 12 with the Visual Basic language on DOS. My dad was building a piece of software for his business and showed me a few things along the way. Throughout the years I experimented and tinkered, never taking myself too seriously until one day it clicked I could do this for money! This led to a profitable software engineering career that eventually landed me at a Silicon Valley company called Arista Networks. Ever since those first days of watching my dad program a system for his business I’ve had a dream of building a comprehensive business management solution. Even though I had a great job, I wanted to start a business around this idea. During my last few months at Arista, I started working on my new company after hours. I called it Singulution and we were going to build a full-duplex real-time point of sale and business management solution for multi-location vendors. ‍"," I failed to launch the product before running out of money. The right approach would have been to build a minimal MVP and then iterate off of customer feedback. I kept it a secret and made it too monolithic. The number of features and the complexity of the system made it difficult to get to MVP stage.  The fact that I decided early on to make everything realtime came with a bunch of overhead. I spent way too much time on infrastructure and too little time interacting with potential customers. I had a pretty set runway and started to see the end approaching. As I was running out of money I started networking looking for opportunities and that’s when I met my current co-founders in E-Dealer Direct. E-Dealer Direct bought our intellectual property and brought me on as CTO for a portion of equity. This was perfect because they were past the MVP stage. They had a working model and had the required technical skills to take it to the next level. Effectively we were bought out by E-DealerDirect and Singulution was shuttered after 10 months. It really wasn’t a big deal since we didn’t have any customers. I was actually relieved to join to E-DealerDirect as CTO because now I get to focus on making the product and interacting with existing customers. We’re moving incredibly fast, gaining traction and changing the way dealers interact with financial institutions.  ‍"," I built what I thought people wanted instead of listening to what they needed. While my system was a thing of beauty from an aesthetic and engineering standpoint, it was almost useless for its intended purpose. Without the complete set of features, the system was not usable. My biggest mistake was that I spent too much time on infrastructure and tech without truly connecting with customers and understanding their core set of needs. From a technology point of view, the system was solid. It was all completely real-time and reactive but it lacked core features that should have been prioritized. I did not solicit feedback soon enough and the feature set was too deep. These mistakes cost large amounts of time and money and ultimately caused our failure.  Our competitors were also established and too far ahead for us to catch up to without a more significant runway. I should have been more discerning when choosing what to work on. Ultimately I severely underestimated the time it would take to develop the full feature set. We should have used our runway to target a smaller feature set, release an MVP and then iterate off of customer feedback. Customers are the core of any business. Without them, you don’t have a business.",,,," After leaving my job I set out building our product full time. And I mean FULL time I spent every waking moment building. This was good and bad. It was good because I was making progress but also bad because I was doing it in a vacuum and I didn’t engage customers until it was too late. Overall, I spent about 10 months in development on a product that I never used. I used Ruby on Rails and React to build a fully real-time interface interconnected with web socket connections. From a technical perspective, it was pretty advanced. I should have started much simpler and found my customer niche before building out so much scaffolding.",," I’ve been an entrepreneur for almost as long as I can remember. My first business was going around the neighborhood selling rocks that I had found. Later it became bicycle shops and now currently technology startups. This inherent entrepreneurial spirit combined with my interest in business software seemed to make a good combination. While all of these businesses eventually failed at some point, I was convinced that Singulution would be the one that made it. In June of 2017, I left my job at Arista Networks and used my stock options and 401k as a runway for my new venture. When I started Singulution I had no idea that it would eventually fail and be absorbed into another startup called E-DealerDirect, where I am currently Chief Technology Officer. I did not know what I didn’t know and I made many mistakes along the way that fate somehow turned into good fortune. ‍"," If I had to start over I would have done more research first. I would have conducted interviews and held information sessions. I engaged my target customer too late and did not address the critical features first. I should have focussed on a minimal MVP and then iterated based on feedback. While I did develop a bunch of features, they were not the most important ones. The time spent on infrastructure should have been on the back side of the process, not the initial step. ",, I wrote an article about how Singulution became E-Dealer Direct.

"," I spent a bunch of my personal money on Singulution but never made a cent back. Overall I probably spent around 30k on a runway for myself to develop this project. I spent all day, every day, exclusively working on the system for 10 months. I did have some tooling costs but I basically used the bulk of the money to survive off of for 10 months. Hindsight, I should have used more of the money on customer engagement. While I did not get direct returns, this “failure” did set me up for a position at E-Dealer Direct where I now focus on building the integrated systems I could only dream about before. My new company has traction, revenue and runway to build some really cool things and parts of our system are even modeled off of the infrastructure from Singulution.

221,sinoficina," Hi there! I’m Bosco Soler, a 35 yo architect from Spain and I'm the creator of SinOficina: the first online coworking for the growing community of freelancers and entrepreneurs in Spain and Latin America. SinOficina —meaning “ Without Office ” in Spanish— helps entrepreneurs providing a virtual environment to connect, collaborate and grow together. We organize online events mainly, but also some offline meetings in several cities in Spain, coliving experiences, and yearly community events. What started as a need to solve my isolation as a freelance two and a half years ago, became a subscription model business that is now my main source of income making around $5K/mo without spending a dollar (or euro) on paid advertisement. ‍",," The biggest challenge was to migrate from Slack to Discord. Migrating a community is always a challenge. People get used to something and they don’t want changes in their routines. Now I can see it was a good decision, but at that time there were doubts and a lot of stress. One of the mistakes was not communicating that migration effectively (with a proper re-onboarding from the beginning, instructions, etc.). ",," We are now around 5,000€ in MRR and +100,000€ in lifetime revenue.

So I started talking about the project on my mailing list (around 800 subscribers at that time).  Meanwhile, I created the website on WordPress with several plugins to accept payments and manage registers. It took a few weeks. I also decided to use Slack as the virtual environment to interact —although a few months ago we migrated to Discord. I then invited my list to a webinar where I explained how the community and the live events would work. I made an offer that lasted a week so I would reward the pioneers and the ones that were confident about the project.  Around 30 people joined. And we grew from there to +500 paying members now.",," I studied architecture in Valencia but after a year traveling around the world while working as a web designer, I decided that was the lifestyle I wanted. Even if that meant quitting a career as an architect —and disappointing my grandma on the way. Working as a freelancer can be lonely, so I started looking for online communities for entrepreneurs and freelancers in Spanish. I rather pay a fee and have an active community and well managed than be free and suffer spam or too much “noise”. I found none that I felt comfortable on. So I created it. ‍"," Build trust from authenticity. Even before launching your product/service. Trust is your most valuable asset as an entrepreneur. Start sharing your journey with others. Start your small audience. Share the good but also the bad. Don’t be afraid to show yourself vulnerable sometimes. People will relate. One-person business does not mean any collaboration. It took me a while to learn that I had to delegate and outsource some of the work that I was doing to focus on the things that I did best and will make SinOficina grow. I now work with 2 other freelancers that are better than me in what they do. Surround yourself with formidable people. There's a well-known proverb that says «if you want to go fast, go alone if you want to go far, go together». That is a good reason to be part of SinOficina but also is something I did to create it. Having a solo project doesn't mean you have to walk the entrepreneurial path alone. There's much to learn from others apart from the ones who write books. ‍"," Word of mouth has been the main channel since the beginning. People were happy. Churn is only around 3%. Also, word of mouth is a great way to filter toxic people, since your community is the one that makes it grow, they chose only to tell people that will be adding value to it, not subtracting it. I’ve been participating in a lot of events and talk about SinOficina everywhere. People identify your passion and connect with the project’s mission and values. Growth has been pretty linear. There hasn't been yet a channel that gave us exponential growth but we are still experimenting. Also, exponential growth may not be what you want if your business is a community. Sometimes it is better to grow slow but sustained. ‍"," I share my thoughts and learnings on entrepreneurship on Twitter and my personal blog. And you can learn more about SinOficina on its website, of course."," I’m loving Discord for communities that require a lot of interaction.

222,sisu-academy," My Name is Becky LeBret, I am from Los Angeles, CA and I am founder of Lotus Launch, a unique four-step program and a community helping female founders take control and grow their businesses. This new project is me bouncing back from a disaster. It’s been moving fast because I’m using lessons learned from my previous business, Sisu Academy. While it has the same heart - I still work to support marginalized entrepreneurs to grow, execute, build systems, and scale through the SaaS solution I am building - the way in which I am approaching it is completely different. Mostly thanks to my lessons learned through failure.  Sisu Academy was a tuition-free non profit boarding school for at-risk youth in San Diego. Our students were not fitting in well at the normal school environments and typically had trouble at home or at school. Our business model initially was based on donations from both large and small donors. We were working toward sustainability by building in revenue streams, mainly through an on campus incubator. We closed down operations before we could see that phase through.  ‍"," Marketing was never our problem, we were successfully getting the word out there. Where it was hard was cash flow, this was a major disadvantage. This is the root of the issues with small nonprofits. Paying for operations is a constant battle, from month to month. You have to keep cash flow coming in at a steady and reliable rate. The nonprofit world, similar to a receivables business, relies on commitments for future donations. As a result we were living from donation check to donation check. If the money doesn't come in when it’s supposed to, your services stop. Not something you can really do with a school. We had some teachers chipping in time here and there to cover the gap, but it was constantly a race against time and their salaries getting paid. It was difficult managing the “just in time” nature of building an untested, never before, new education model in a system rife with challenges. Continuing to ask for the belief in the people around you just so you can keep going is tough because so much is at stake. Your team is not made up of entrepreneurs, in our case they were all teachers. From their perspective all they saw were missed goals and late deliverables. They struggled to handle the instability of launching something new.  It didn’t help that my husband and I also had a baby during the beta launch of the school. My son was literally born in the middle of this project. When you are a mother, you can’t move as quickly as you once did and burn the midnight oil as you wish especially when both parents are involved in the same project. Our biggest arguments were in deciding who was given the opportunity to work more and who had to work less on any given day. We decided to hire a nanny, which we couldn’t afford.  ‍  In the nonprofit world, few donors want to donate toward salaries or overhead and when running a school these are a major expense. We had to creatively find ways to pay the bills and bring in more money. We hosted galas, auctions and small marketing campaigns to bring in smaller donations. Although we raised about $1M dollars, the program was expensive to run and we couldn’t operate on an accounts receivable basis with an active school with real live students. We had to rethink our overhead and our cost per student. Our employees were the largest expense, followed by room and board for the students.  We were waiting for a major check from a donor and it was four months late, it nearly buried us as our employees were getting restless and losing faith in the mission and our intentions. The check came just in time but the cultural damage to the staff and students was too great. We decided to make another pivot, pull the ripcord, move toward virtual learning which helped to solve our cashflow problem. We then made plans to merge with another local school who was moving from charter to private. The ink had not dried on the new merger when the pandemic hit and through our project into total chaos. One week before everything shutdown the writing was on the wall so we moved quickly to place the girls in public schools and back with their caregivers. It was devastating and embarrassing as it was so public. Everyone in our inner and outer circles knew what we were up to and ultimately the fate of the program. ",,,,," It took six years to get from idea to launch. We were industry outsiders having never been in education, but we were comfortable learning and building partnerships. Starting a non profit is not for the faint of heart, especially bootstrapping one. We started Next Ed Research first, which is our education research and development entity, before launching Sisu. My husband and I were the primary ones involved, then we successfully attracted a highly regarded teacher in the San Diego area to be our first hire. We used all the startup tools we could (Slack, Asana, Google Suite) and then we ventured into Salesforce for Non profit as our CRM. It was very difficult to get the employees to adopt technology used in start ups so that was tough on me because I had my tech stack that I was used to. We ran into a lot of obstacle when building the product. One example from a tech side is Salesforce for Non profit because it is a beast. Once I got the hang of it I started small think tanks with other non profits who were using Salesforce for their social good projects. Salesforce recognized our work and featured us as a social good program who was doing some great things with the tech in our non profit. That was an honor.  We were successful in getting a lot of press both nationally and local including TV stations and news outlets to cover our endeavor. I was the behind the scenes person focusing more on operations, while my husband was the one who was going to networking event after networking event to get us to visibility we needed to get the dollars coming in. Our project was exciting and new with a huge mission to save kids lives. This is the sort of thing that attracts a lot of attention. "," We used everything we could. Email marketing, social media, events, galas, media, new stories, speaking and interviews. They all worked and contributed to our success. The most successful thing we did was network our asses off, meeting the right people, getting our story in front of the right people was what made all the difference.  Once we had our model and plan in place we spoke at about six conferences a year, attended dozens more, added over 500 new contacts a quarter for the first three years. We were part of every local networking organization that we could be part of to talk about the business and spread the word about the business. The Chamber of Commerce served as a powerful vehicle, but it was really about getting introduced to the right people so they could introduce us to the right people. We had three TV interviews, numerous podcast interviews, and wrote articles for news outlets. One connection and meeting would lead to the next and before you know it we are being invited to Washington DC to meet with the Secretary of Education. The effort was exhausting at times, but it served as a way to “megaphone” the mission and vision so we could reach the right people who could help.  ‍"," Before Sisu Academy, I was working in the start up sector in Silicon Valley for a “Unicorn”, a billion dollar valued start up in the Human Resource Information Systems realm of business. I excel in partnership development, strategic thinking and in building infrastructures for communications. That’s code for working well with people and understanding how to lay the foundations for effective communication. I’ve also worked in conservative consulting corporations, law firms and and insurance companies. I’ve had a lot of corporate experience so the comfort and stability of a regular job and income was all I knew.  I always had a nagging feeling that I could do so much more and make some positive social change in the world, I just didn't know how and was scared to do so. It wasn’t until I met my husband, a serial entrepreneur, and fellow do-gooder, that we decided to start this new social good venture.  The idea was inspired by my co-founder, my husband. His mom suffered mental health issues, he had an absent father and was raised by his grandparents primarily. We reimagined a school that would offer support for young kids so they had the care and support they needed to succeed. One day we were at a bar in Humboldt, California and on the back of a napkin we imagined what a new school would look like. It included a place to offer a supportive living environment where kids would build their dreams, their businesses. I thought it was too crazy to work. Then I went to work researching it, building the business plan and then poof we started to gain momentum.  ‍"," Given the opportunity again and starting this next business I would: a) Focus on Cash: Align operating budget with cash on hand not based on accounts receivable or accrued revenue. I would have also increased our credit limits well before we needed it. I’m definitely not as scared of debt as I used to be, I view it more as a tool to manage cash and grow during a start-up.  b) Pivot fast, but ensure that you have the money to pivot. We decided to exit for several reasons, the risk increased considerably once the pandemic hit, and there is no equity in a non-profit. In a for-profit, the strategy may have been different, but this was reality.  c) Recognize when to hire staff and when to hold off. Hire slow or not at all. We got so much pressure from the staff, parents, and students against remote learning and the “walls of a school” we caved. This led to high overhead in areas when maybe we shouldn't have. We certainly didn't know how quickly the learning environment would have changed to move online, the pandemic only accelerated it.  d) Build means to track progress, measure, and manage. Data always shifts through growth, so just ensure metrics are aligned with the mission. Set aside time to do high impact projects, like managing an operations dashboard and sharing it with partners, staff (if you choose) or investors. Don’t add a middle manager out of the gates to manage the metrics, or prepare to have your vision sidetracked. e) Develop personal boundaries. Don't give up more than your future self is willing to. This time around, I am thinking more carefully about the sacrifices I am willing to make for success. I am envisioning what my life will look like when it does succeed. I want to ensure I have the proper time for my family and friends, my husband and my son, and do the things that I want to do, like see more of the world and make some positive change while I’m at it. I’m creating a business that will fit my lifestyle today and will grow and easily adapt with my projected lifestyle 5-10 years from now. ‍",," Here’s Sisu Academy’s website.

223,snapshooter," Hi there! My name is Simon Bennett. I am a 29-year-old husband, father of two from the United Kingdom.  I am the founder and CEO of SnapShooter, a server and database backup company founded in 2017. I have been responsible for all aspects of the business, from programming to support. We run a typical SaaS model with customers paying a monthly or yearly subscription, and we also offer a free-forever plan as an additional acquisition strategy. ",," The biggest challenge for us, and any business, is acquiring new customers. Marketing a service like ours is challenging, and getting our product in front of a small-ish audience is hard.  We’ve tried several ways to generate those customers, such as paid acquisition and CPC campaigns. The results haven’t been great, but it’s something we continue to refine and test to find the best method of outreach.  While I’m definitely at home writing code, the marketing side has been a challenge for me. My strong dyslexia makes writing content challenging, but we’ve found some great external partners to help us with this, and it’s something I don’t have to worry so much about.  ",," Things are going well! I was initially unsure what it would be like to manage every part of the business, from coding to support to accounting, payment processing to developer relations, and so on. I have learned so much. SnapShooter is growing every month, and we continue to add new services for our users.  SnapShooter has been an excellent thing for my family as well. With the business earning enough now, I can fully support my family, and my wife has gone back to university, which is fantastic. I love spending time with my kids, and I love to spend time in my garage. I’ve got a classic car in there that I’m excited to get into restoring, but as with most things, it’s always a challenge to find the time. That’s a long-term goal.  For the future of SnapShooter, I want to continue our investment in the platform to help it grow. I’d like to continue to expand our content marketing efforts, grow our industry partnerships, and, most excitingly, start to plan to bring on our first developers. I’ve got an exciting roadmap ahead and will need help to do all the things I’d like to add to SnapShooter.  I want to do this while still offering excellent support to our users and making sure that the product is accessible to everyone, from enterprise users to indie developers who are just starting to build the next generation of amazing web apps.",," For SnapShooter, I didn’t follow the typical business validation and customer need steps of product development. Since the development happened so quickly, I thought it was best to get it out there and start collecting feedback and hear from people about what they needed in a backup service.  Once launched, we did some outreach. I was pretty transparent with sharing about the business, its growth, and more for several years. I’ve participated in sites like Indie Hackers and learned so much from sharing with the community there. We also launched SnapShooter on Product Hunt and had a great experience. As the business grew, I eventually stopped being so transparent, but the experience of sharing in those early years was beneficial for me (and the product!) At first, we offered a 7-day free trial with a credit card. As time has gone on, we’ve shifted from that model to offer a free plan. Our free plan allows developers to use it to do one backup (one server or database, for example.) That model has allowed people to try the service, see its value, and then bring SnapShooter into their company or workplace to use at an enterprise level. We’re always experimenting with different plans and trials to see what connects with potential (and existing) customers. ‍",," When I left university at 21, I followed a pretty typical developer path. I started in a junior developer role and worked my way up from there. I was a lead developer and eventually served as a CTO before leaving to go full-time to work on SnapShooter. Towards the end of my time in the corporate world, I led a project that included moving some dedicated servers at Rackspace over to the flexible droplets at DigitalOcean. During this project, I did a deep dive into the DigitalOcean API and discovered that I could back up my projects every day for less than DigitalOcean was charging for weekly backups. This lightbulb moment was the push to start to develop the very first version of SnapShooter. Unlike the large software projects, I had led or developed (or even some of the failed SaaS ideas I started to build and abandoned,) making the first version of SnapShooter took just two weeks from idea to working prototype. Since the initial investment was minimal - mostly just a couple of hours every evening -  it made sense to get a website together and get it out there. There wasn’t much to lose in getting users in there and start getting their feedback. I didn’t do a whole bunch of customer acquisition-type activities at first, but it’s grown from that initial launch. Four years later, it’s been amazing to grow the platform, and it’s gone from just backing up DigitalOcean droplets to offering many types of platform, database, server and application backups, even Ubiquity cloud controllers. We’ve spent the time and effort building a fantastic backup engine that’s the core of all our services. We’re really proud of it."," After failing on my first few indie projects, I’ve found that starting small is the key. For me, getting the product in front of customers was so critical to our early growth. They gave us valuable feedback and helped make sure we were on the right path. The version of SnapShooter our customers use today is very different from what it was when it first launched, and that’s good.  Second, I would say take the time, even early on, to do customer research. From surveys to customer interviews, it’s all critical data that you can use to help guide your work. Michele Hansen at Geocodio is doing a fantastic job in this space right now. Her book (and website), Deploy Empathy, is great. The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick is also an excellent book about talking to your customers.  Finally, I’ve learned so much about the legal side of the business. It doesn’t get talked about much, and I get that. It’s expensive and tedious, but it’s so critical. Once you have some product validation, it’s crucial to work with a lawyer to review your work. Everything from your terms and conditions, privacy information, and branding/trademarks are important to get right. Unfortunately, I had to issue a cease-and-desist letter to a competitor that launched a product with a very similar name to ours. What could have been a nightmare was resolved quickly thanks to ensuring all our legal ducks were in a row.  "," For SnapShooter, we’ve seen tremendous growth when focusing on word of mouth, referrals, and organic SEO. Over the last year, we’ve focused on writing great content and sharing lots of information about SnapShooter across our blog and social media. We plan to expand that content in the next year, covering more than just backups. The challenge is that Google’s algorithms are constantly changing, and it takes work to keep ranking well on some of the keywords we’ve pushed to be ranked highly on.  We have also started building partnerships and relationships with service providers and hosting companies. We see this as a valuable opportunity to reach even more people and help those companies with a service that could take up a lot of their time and effort internally.  ‍"," You can learn more about SnapShooter at Snapshooter.com, of course, but you can also follow us on Twitter at @snapshooterio. I’m also decently active on Twitter at @mrsimonbennett.  If you’re a solo founder or part of a small startup, we’ve also got a Discord channel where we talk and share development ideas, best practices, and more.

224,sofetch," My name is Maggie Ryan Rostamian. I’m 24, and I’m based in Armenia, but right now I’m in Los Angeles (got stuck here because of Covid19!). In 2019, I went over to my manicurist, who also happened to be one of my closest friends. There, I saw some glaring issues she was experiencing, that could be easily fixed with a simple app. Customers were always late (a scheduling issue) and she was paying a high rent because that salon owner couldn’t optimize their space (a successful business model for that already existed: Airbnb). I took the glaring market issues and put them into three main buckets - stylist, salon owner, and customer. Sofetch was an all in one platform, connecting customers, technicians, and space providers with the sole aim of becoming the most convenient and cost-effective way of hosting, providing, and receiving beauty services. Me, my sister and my best friend were co-founders. I was the CEO. We had an all-girls team!  Our business model was a flat transaction fee rate when customers booked stylists. This was our competitive advantage, as other apps would charge %, which would result in high commission rates. For stylists to book space providers, there was a payment tier depending on the type of space, location, and rented time.  ‍"," Covid 19 halted everything. My sister and I flew out in March, as we were about to meet with our first influencer and launch the following week. Covid 19 was sweeping California. I knew at that time that Sofetch's future was in jeopardy.  Looking back, there are several things that I could have done differently. I didn’t spend a lot of time testing the idea. Instead, I dedicated all of my time to solving problems. While there is a time and place for that, I should have spent more time building and rebuilding simple no code prototypes to test the foundation of the idea itself. The response was always positive - we engaged different stylists, salon owners, and customers. However, looking back, I would have preferred to actually build a simple prototype and test their habits. This was a marketplace product and it needed both sides to join for it to actually work. Instead of hiring an engineer straight away, I would have preferred to have done more research and testing. However, I wouldn’t change that decision as it brought me the best person in my life. ‍  Covid 19 was the main reason behind our failure. Sofetch tried to pivot into many other ideas, to fit the changing market. Unfortunately, we knew that Covid 19 would change the beauty industry for a while (the % of capacity that would be allowed in the saloons, the risk associated with going to a closed space, and most importantly, the changing buying behavior of consumers). After failing to succeed with the 15th pivot, I decided it made no sense to keep fighting something that was completely out of my control. I was an emotional mess for months leading up to the closure. I was extremely exhausted mentally and I was totally broken. When I decided to close the doors, I finally felt relief. Although it was extremely sad and heartbreaking, I finally felt like I did something and it worked.  A lot of the negative feelings I had were associated with the belief that this was my personal failure, that this was all about me and my ego. It took a few months to figure out that in fact, it really wasn’t about that. After closing down the doors, about a month later, Anna called me up with an idea. We develop it further and launch Recoon within a few days. Everything happens for a reason!",,,,," The idea was developed at the end of July, and by September I was quitting my full-time job to dedicate full time to making this happen.  My sister and I began working straight away. We pulled some funds together and hired our first engineer - Anna Grigoryan - who is now my best friend and current co-founder in our new startup, Recoon.  She was the person who was going to take our ideas and make them into reality. My now-husband, then-boyfriend, was in the startup scene in Armenia and was able to connect and find the brilliant Anna. Our obstacles were technical, design, but most importantly, legal. We wanted to test this product in Armenia - consumers spent 60% of their income on beauty services and it was a small enough market to easily test. However, Armenia didn’t have a payment processing system like Stripe or Paypal, and as a result, it created difficulties in the legality of transferring funds. Specifically, on who would pay the taxes on each transaction. As there weren’t any P2P payment systems, the funds needed to go through Sofetech’s bank account, which meant the tax burden fell on us. Moreover, Armenian’s relies on cash, and not bank cards, which made our efforts a lot harder. We found a way around these issues, working with lawyers and even Government officials. Before launch, we participated in a startup competition called Neruzh, and we won first place for Innovation, with a $25k grant prize. The Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, met with all the winners and this was publicized."," As we started thinking about the launch, we began reaching out to Armenian beauty influencers in Los Angeles and Armenia. We began working with them, and my sister and I flew out to Los Angeles to meet with some. The goal was to onboard them and create a networking beauty event, which would help us launch successfully.  I found it advantageous to reach out to every single tier of “influencer” one on one. The goal wasn’t to get them to advertise but to gain their insight and feedback. I would also offer them titles such as “Lead Influencer”, without committing any equity, to build out an “influencer board” (just like an advisory board). This was to ensure they felt part of the startup, rather than just another means of advertising. ‍"," Before Sofetch, I worked at Anchor (now Spotify) and PicsArt in community building. I was, and still am, a huge beauty service consumer. As a result, I became very close to all my service providers. They felt comfortable speaking to me about finances and the disadvantages and advantages of the industry. That’s how I found about their common challenges and Sofetch’s idea came up. ‍"," I would tell myself that everything takes time. I am an extremely goal-oriented person. So if I am not hitting my targets, I get discouraged.  Many people have told me to take my time, that I’m moving too fast, and that I’m not doing it the “traditional” way. I’m very happy that I’ve never listened to them. If I did, I would have delayed the “failure”, lessons learned and experiences by months, if not years. Moving fast is good, at least it was for me. I would also tell myself to stop thinking that everyone is smarter and better than me. Everyone gives contradicting advice, and it’s up to the entrepreneur to be able to build their own filter system. I learned that not everyone’s intentions are always good, and if they are, that doesn’t mean that they are completely right. And advice is such a subjective matter. ‍",," A post I wrote on Indie Hackers about “Lessons I learned from Sofetch’s Failure”.

225,softwareideas," Hi there! I’m Kevin Conti and I’m the founder of Software Ideas, a paid newsletter that sends hand-picked, validated SaaS ideas directly to your inbox. It’s currently sitting at about $8,000 MRR in just over four months, and I’m really enjoying it! ‍",," Software Ideas is the overnight success story right now, but it comes from a lot of mistakes in the past. I’ve talked about CoderNotes.io, but I also have owned and operated a (failed) residential cleaning company, a (failed) textbook reselling business, and a (failed) auction-based reselling business. No one hits it out of the park on their first try. To quote Ben Orenstein from Tuple, “Start your first three businesses as quickly as possible.” ‍",," The business has grown linearly, with about 100 new customers per month. The free email list (where I send a preview newsletter each week) is over 4,000 strong and my last email to them had a 50% open rate. If you want to see Software Ideas’ metrics, they are publicly available here. My main goal for the business is to help as many founders as I can. I don’t want anyone to fall into the same hole I did with CoderNotes.io - building something for months that people will never buy. To help founders with this, I’m working on a course specifically around pre-sales and validation. I’m calling it The Foundation, and I’ve included it at no additional cost to members of Software Ideas. From a metric perspective, my biggest goal right now is to expand the marketing and distribution with a new channel. I’m hoping that finding one to two new channels will rocket our growth into the $10k and even $20k range over the next 3-6 months.  At that point, I hope that I’ll be financially secure and personally ready to quit my full-time developer job and work on Software Ideas full time.",," After CoderNotes.io, I was experimenting with ways of de-risking my idea validation. I had been burned by getting an email list with ~200 subscribers, over 400 votes on Product Hunt, but still getting close to 0 sales. I was determined to make my business either succeed or fail faster this time - and I did it using pre-sales. I think pre-sales are an underrated tool. If you come in with the mindset of, “Pay me now and you’ll get in on the ground floor, I’ll build the product to be exactly what you want, at a fraction of the cost it would take for you to hire a contractor”, I think pre-sales are a powerful tool. It also tells you as quickly as possible whether you’re on the right track or not. So I set myself a goal that out of 100 qualified leads, I would convert at least 10 for a month of newsletters at $19. And after 33 qualified leads, I already had my 10, so I went ahead and launched the product. I’ve released those email conversations, for free, for people wanting to see exactly how I had those pre-sell conversations. They’re all available in this Notion template (with names hidden, of course).",," I never meant to make Software Ideas. I’m a full-time software developer. On the side, I launched CoderNotes.io, a website for developers to take technical notes that can be easily searched. While that product got a lot of interest (including landing as #2 product of the day on Product Hunt), today it sits at around $50 MRR. I learned from that project that building something people think is cool is NOT the same thing as building something people want to pay for. I also learned that the market you choose is incredibly important. You want to be in a market where customers are already spending money. I documented everything that I learned from the experience in this IndieHackers post: 5 Lessons Learned from Launching my first SaaS. After that experience, I decided I wanted to take what I’ve learned and apply it to something new, instead of  trying to pivot CoderNotes.io to be something else. So I started doing market research. It started by looking at job boards. After all, if they can afford to hire employees, they must be doing something right! Eventually I learned that there were paid databases of company information that would be far more efficient than going through job boards, but they cost up to $1,000 per year. At that point, the pieces fell into place. I realized that the research I was doing might be valuable to people, and now I had an incentive to try to sell it (so I could make up the cost of the databases).  So, Software Ideas was never meant to be a product - I was just trying to research some SaaS ideas for myself! ‍"," I’ve learned a ton from Software Ideas. It’s hard to put into words. Here are some key ones: It took me eight months to get CoderNotes.io to $50 revenue, and I worked just as hard or harder than I have on Software Ideas, which hitted +$4,000 in a quarter of the time. The market and idea you choose matters.Writing a paid weekly newsletter is an exercise in discipline. You don’t get any weeks off, and you better make sure that you deliver a high-quality issue each week. While the opportunity for recurring revenue is great, you need to be prepared for what you’re getting into with this business model. And some personal ones: It’s really, really hard to celebrate milestones. I’ve struggled each time to take a step back, breathe, and enjoy myself. I have to be intentional in rewarding myself, otherwise I never take time to enjoy the spoils of my efforts.Starting a company comes with a lot of anxiety, stress, and even depression. I thought these things were at their worst when you aren’t successful, but the more successful you get, the further you can fall, and the more those negative emotions weigh on you. Focusing on your health and mental well-being is key, and something I need to do better on. ‍  I think I’ve done a decent job in my first two months, and it’s probably too early to answer this question correctly. But the main thing I would do is to tell myself to be prepared for the content mill. It’s incredibly challenging to keep up a high-quality, deeply-researched publication without help. And I would want to prepare myself for that. ‍"," When you look at the template above, you’ll see that one of the things I tested during the pre-sell phase were distribution channels. Not only did I want to test that people would buy the newsletter, but I also wanted to make sure that I could reach them. To do this, I made experiments on multiple different channels. I posted a free, proof-of-concept version of my newsletter to Indie Hackers, Reddit, and Twitter. That’s how I found the original 33 qualified leads for pre-sales. You can see that original post on Indie Hackers here. Since then, Twitter and Indie Hackers have been the two best channels for me, but they take a lot of work. In both places, my goal is to create high-quality content that really helps fellow founders in getting to the same stage I’m at. On Indie Hackers, I’ve also publicly shared my numbers through the Milestones section, which people have found interesting. I’m still nailing down my Twitter strategy, but it basically falls along the same lines. Now, I’m looking for my next distribution channel. I’m exploring a number of opportunities, just like I did the first time, and hopefully I’ll find one or two more that reliably bring in new customers. Two channels that I’m looking at very seriously are newsletter sponsorships and SEO, but I won’t know what works until my experiments with them are complete at the end of the month. ‍"," If you’re actively looking for your next software or SaaS business, I’d love to see you over at SoftwareIdeas.

Obviously Awesome - This book teaches you about how to really look at a market, and understand how customers exhibit their wants and needs inside of it.

It sounds like we really messed this up, but the revenue at scale could have been ridiculous. We would be taking 15% of all wagers, and not putting cash up ourselves like a bookie would. Our biggest costs would have been marketing and servers as we scaled. Legal issues in the US scared off investors. It was around the time that the legislation was being looked into and Fanduel & Draftkings started getting banned in some states. Investors saw us losing potentially our biggest market, as well as the risk that they’d launch in the UK to compete with us (Draftkings did later that year but with a very American product, it never gained any traction as far as I’m aware). When we failed to close a round in March the year after we launched, we knew it was over. We were definitely gutted, we had a product people really loved, it looked great and it worked well, but the commercials just didn’t work without the scale that investment would have brought us. It took us a little while to close, filling out the paperwork etc, but the 2 big moments that we felt the most were when we had confirmation that our gambling licenses had been surrendered, and then when we had confirmation that the company closed. Fortunately, we didn’t have a staff or any other dependants, so it kinda was just a case of switching the website off and handling communications with users. My co-founder has moved on to work at a few different startups as a CTO, which are doing pretty well, while I’ve worked for a Zipcar competitor, and in the gaming industry again. Now I specialize is customer journey marketing, helping companies convert more of their traffic into customers, and keeping those customers engaged and retained for longer, and at higher values. I love working with data, spending my days looking for optimization experiments, implementing them, and seeing the numbers move in the right direction."," Marketing turned out to be a huge issue. We didn’t know the gambling industry, and they didn’t know the DFS model, so affiliates and partners were trying to charge the commissions that they’d charge other gambling firms. We’re talking at least £60 CPA, but the biggest guys wanted over £200. Given that we were projected an LTV of around £50, it obviously didn’t work for us. As mentioned before, Investment was a problem. I had relationships with some big funds from before, but they all had money from investors who wouldn’t touch gambling.  Team resource was a problem as well. Although we didn’t have the money to hire, I didn’t have that much time for the project while working a full-time job. Pitching to investors, and trying to run all the marketing in just a couple of hours a day is really difficult when you’re desperate to grow as quickly as possible. I wouldn’t put direct competition down as a big issue though. There were some guys who had been around a year or so longer, had backing, had the experience. But we didn’t have high opinions of them, and their platforms were definitely inferior. It was still just a brand new idea in the UK really, no one was looking for you, so you had to work hard to put your brand out in front of people. Other mistakes...we probably tried a couple of channels that I should have known wouldn’t work. We got an ad in a digital magazine for university students and it drove nothing. The audience was probably right, I just doubt the quality of the magazine itself really (and having worked in the magazine industry, I should have known better.) If I could pick out one main thing that we could have done better, it would be a focus. My co-founder should have dealt with 90% of the investment stuff, while I attended London meetings when necessary, and I should have just focused my time on marketing and bumping our numbers up as quickly as possible. ",,,," We just kind of kicked it off and got started really. I designed some wireframes, we used 99designs to get our initial site done and my co-founder just cracked on with coding it all. We started applying for our licenses after speaking to lawyers (which actually wasn’t as helpful as expected). The initial advice was ‘you probably need this license, you might need that one,’ but nothing too concrete, so obviously we rejected their proposal of £10-15k per license application and just did it ourselves. It meant writing our Know-Your-Customer policies, ISO policies, proving funds were available etc, but my co-founder came from finance so had been through all this before and writing it for ourselves wasn’t an issue. I think we got the first version live at the end of August, having missed maybe the first game of the new season, and we agreed to go ahead with the business in February so the whole process took maybe 6-7 months to get live.  It was good fun, my co-founder was based in the States so he’d normally send me some things to look at when he finished for the day, I’d pick them up first thing and have feedback by the time he was awake, so we developed quite a good way of working like that. The best bit was obviously getting the site live though, getting our first users in and seeing people actually playing the games, and everything working as expected. You could sit there with the site open on your phone, watching the games, and you’d see everyone's scores going up and down as players scored or lost points. We built up a bit of an email database before launch, and so pushed it out to that list, along with our friends and networks. We very quickly got to the stage where the main games each week were filled within about 15 minutes of us putting them up on site, which was normally as the current games closed due to the actual fixtures kicking off. It meant we had engaged users keeping an eye on their scores, but also getting setup for the following fixtures. ",," I’d always been looking for an opportunity to start something of my own. I worked in a very entrepreneurial role, with the founder of one of the biggest voucher/discount code sites in the UK. My role at the time gave me a lot of freedom to explore new technologies, and come up with new proposals that would add value to the business, however, it was always focused around that business's core focus discounts. I actually left the company shortly before starting Sport Draftr, and moved into a Head of Product & Marketing role at a startup, it involved a lot of early stage marketing strategy, as well as working on the overhaul of their entire website and business model. My co-founder was a friend I had lived with for just over a year (we actually met in the back of a tuk-tuk in Thailand on the way to the full moon party!), but he moved to the US as his girlfriend was there. Fortunately, this turned into a bit of a blessing for us, as it exposed him to the US model of Daily Fantasy Sports. We looked at the Daily Fantasy model that Fanduel and Draftkings had launched in the US and thought this would be great for the UK market. We have a huge gambling industry here, and so combining that with stats and the ability to pick your own team should have been a winner. In the UK, Fantasy Premier League has been the go-to fantasy site for years, but the one big problem a lot of people face with it is that if you miss a week or two, or just have a bad week, you can fall behind so much it kind of gets a bit pointless and people lose interest. We worked hard to build a model that could make any player a potential points scorer. The example we always use is that Michael Carrick (who won everything you can with Manchester United), was always a pointless pick in Fantasy Premier League. He doesn’t score, he doesn’t assist, doesn’t get a clean sheet bonus because he’s not in defense, and so why would you pay to have him on your team? With our model, he scored points for his passes, time in possession, tackles and interceptions that were the mainstay of his game. I’d always been entrepreneurial, I had tested out a couple of different ideas such as a travel site, but always canned them because of high competition, and the requirement for huge amounts of traffic to make the revenue models work. A year or two before Sport Draftr, I was actually in a business development role looking for new markets and new opportunities for the company I was at to expand and generate new revenue streams, so the research and product development areas were already there for me."," I wouldn’t make it a gambling service. We would have gone down a freemium app route of some sort, allowing us to get users from all around the world, not just the UK. It would have made getting users easier, reduced our costs and possibly completely removed the need for investment. "," We grew mostly through Facebook advertising. We’d promote blog posts about how players were performing, and we developed a ‘Power Ranking’ which gave an idea of which players would do best that weekend based on how they were performing individually, as well as their team's performance and oppositions. These proved really popular, along with player comparisons. When big teams were playing each other such as Liverpool vs Man City, we’d pick out 2 key players, highlight some key stats and asked people who they thought would score the most points that weekend. We also got a load of good feedback on various forums which contributed to some OK organic growth. One thing that really helped was launching in an industry that people are super passionate about - football. People loved the stats we were throwing out on social and were always happy to chip in with comments of their own.  We got to about 1,000 users, of which about 50% played weekly across different games, with the average monthly spend peaking for us at just under £30. "," The best thing would be to connect with me on LinkedIn. I share thoughts on Customer Journey Optimisation, and I’m always happy to chat there. There’s also my site if you want to understand a bit more about what I do (although you’ll understand why my co-founder handled the design side!)"," I have a bunch of newsletters all go into a folder, and I check through it every now and again. Blogs such as Groove (customer service), Crazy Egg, Hotjar and CXL for conversion, Internet Retailing and a bunch of others really.  Dan Kennedy ‘No B.S’ books are great, and I generally read loads, but I have half a bookshelf full of books still to get through. They’re all business or marketing focused. "," Revenue was just less than £1000, which means we probably took £6-7000 in entry fees. We just didn’t manage to keep the site alive without investment. I think we lost about £45,000, and a year's worth of time on this. So not huge amounts by some standards, but it was quite a high risk as we knew we were reliant on investment to really grow the company and keep it going. ‍",Entertainment,Legal Challenges,United Kingdom,"November 6, 2019",Will Laurenson,https://www.failory.com/interview/sport-draftr,"['https://www.linkedin.com/in/willlaurenson/', 'http://www.monkeyblocks.com']",failure,0,,"Will created Sport Draftr, a Daily Fantasy Sports site in the UK, offering leagues in the English Premier League, and UEFA Champions League.

227,spuds," Hey there! I am currently working on a men's apparel company, SPUDS, that is focusing on simplifying the wardrobe by creating performance apparel that can be worn everywhere and for anything, all while never looking out of place. Before working on this, I was a recent Industrial Engineering / Technology college graduate who also ran a side business that sold maintenance and protection products to schools and sports facilities. ‍",," The single biggest challenge was just being able to believe that everything would work out even when things were getting tough. There were points where I did not think the Kickstarter would ever fund, and took a step back for a few days to clear my mind and gain some motivation again. There were other frustrating times when manufacturing wasn’t going well, or a customer had a complaint. During all of these troubled times, though, I just knew in the back of my head it would work out. I could take these failures and issues and learn from them, and if I got through it the first time I would never make it happen again. Another challenge I have faced when starting and building Spuds is the number of decisions you have to make and things you have to learn. I have been fortunate to surround myself with people within the garment/apparel industry that are very experienced as it has helped me to learn and take their advice when needing to make manufacturing and design decisions. When it has come to all of the other aspects of growing a business, such as SEO, marketing, social media, media, etc, it has been very difficult being able to constantly improve in many aspects while trying to keep the business as lean as possible. With such a limited fund I have made it a priority to learn each department needed to help start and build this business, and it is a daily struggle trying to prioritize what to learn and what areas to apply that knowledge to. I have helped simplify this over time by prioritizing different parts of the day to different projects and tasks of each department, to make sure that I don’t start jumping around and can actually focus and learn in one area at a time. Lastly, the biggest personal challenge I have faced is dealing with anxiety and mood swings, to say the least. When it comes to the entrepreneurial journey, I believe that your mental health is one of if not the most important aspect. You are constantly dealing with daily success to failure swings, as well as that constant uncertainty of whether what you are working on will actually work or not. Having a support group, both from friends, family, and professionally, is extremely important during this time and making sure your mental health does not interfere with your work is good for both yourself and those around you. ‍  I would say that the single biggest mistake that we committed was being too confident with our first production. There were a lot of rookie mistakes that we didn’t take into account that hurt us overall, but we were able to stay on top without complete failure by keeping our initial customers constantly updated so they never felt out of the loop. The biggest production mistakes we made were: - Underestimating how much time it would take: Our initial promise for our Kickstarter backers was to have all product delivered starting in October. This was based off initial estimates we got from all our suppliers during other parts of the year, but did not realize that this time frame when a lot of other companies are wanting to create their own product in time for the holiday season. The production of our fabric and the final creation of the DIA Short were both longer than expected. We kept all of our backers in the loop, giving them weekly updates and a lifetime discount for all of the troubles. - Under-ordering material: We ended up not ordering enough material and the yield from production was lower than expected. This caused production to be short on a few color and sizing combinations for orders that were already placed. To fix this, I reached out to these customers randomly and offered them a refund, color change, or to wait until the next production. It worked out okay in the end, and everyone chose the option that they were most happy with.",,,," The idea originally came about in early 2017 when I was looking for new workout gear, but was dissatisfied with everything the high-end companies in the market had to offer. They are obviously great for working out, but I couldn’t justify paying a premium price for something I can only wear a few hours of the day. I also thought that all of the media pockets sucked, and having recently bought an iPhone Plus model phone, I had no where to put it besides on the floor! These two issues are what sparked my interest in finding a single solution of one piece of clothing that could be worn for working out, going out, and everywhere in between, all while including technologies that made the life more simple and design features like our Hip-Locked Media pocket that actually solved some real-world issues. From there, it was a matter of doing the research for a good contractor (made in California), asking the right questions to find a professional pattern maker, fabric manufacturer, and trimmings (zippers and drawcords). We went through a ton of different fabrics, parts, and prototypes until we were finally at a point that we were ready to start our Kickstarter funding process. ‍",,," The first thing I would do differently during the campaign is focus more on our media. We had a great product, but I felt like our video and photo efforts didn’t get the point across as well as it should have. We live in a society now that is completely focused on visuals, and text explanations only go so far. We have since focused more on our branding and now that we have officially launched, I am satisfied with the direction we are going. On a similar note of things I wish were done differently for launch would be to include press more seriously. I do wish that I had more initial production samples created that could be sent off to press, because I found that they really are interested in even the smallest of startups or companies, but I regret not taking it seriously enough or including it in our marketing plan as prominently. On the contrary, the one thing that I felt like I spent too much time on was on the small things that didn’t directly correlate with selling the product. I do like to work into the future, as I call it, where what I am working on today is really applied for some time down the road. The issue during the Kickstarter was that I got into that mood and started to work on things that would apply after the Kickstarter was funded. If I were to go back I would have focused all of my efforts and crushing the funding goal as quickly as possible, instead of putting efforts elsewhere. All in all, if I were able to go back, I would tell myself to do these changes. I believe that we didn’t fund as successfully as we could of due to lack of press coverage and good media to showcase the product, as well as spending too much time on the small details that didn’t convert to direct sales at the start. ‍"," We are mainly focusing on the digital side of the advertising spectrum. Before going live with our Kickstarter we focused on creating a newsletter mailing list by utilizing Instagram to attract potential backers with an enticing reward. During the campaign, we were able to use influencers, some small press outlets, and Facebook ads to drive our funding. Now that we are at the stage where we are officially launched, we are still utilizing social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest with good results. We are also creating a social media campaign with a number of influencers to help push our sales, for not too much cost, and are utilizing some large and small press outlets to also help tell our story. Facebook ads will also continue, with a focus on finding our target market through multiple campaigns and doubling down on the ads that work the best. On top of this, we also have plans to really push our content marketing pipelines with a new journal we will be introducing. Our focus on this journal is not to try to sell a product directly, but to work with other well-known individuals in related industries to bring together people, ideas, and inspirations to help people focus on simplifying and cutting out all of the ‘fat’ in their lives to help them focus and pursue their true passions. We hope that this journal can be used in a way that will make people wanting to come back to read the most recent story, and not just be another ad."," You can get more details about SPUDS here. We are also on all major social media outlets - Instagram, Twitter, Facebook at @wearspuds. Thank you!"," My favorite mediums for learning about things are podcasts, research, and online resources. My current favorite podcast is Marketing School by Neil Patel and Eric Siu. It is a great resource for marketing, and I love that they get straight to the point. Research is a trait that I think is important for everyone to learn. I love researching how other companies have done things, listening to talks from other founders, looking up backlinks and social media pages to pick out things that I like so I can implement an adaptation of it into my own company.

228,stacking-the-bricks," My name is Alex Hillman. I'm 37 and I’m based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I split my daytime into two main businesses and some other projects that are adjacents to them. The first business is Indy Hall, a coworking community and space that I started in 2006. It was initially focused on Philadelphia, but as things evolved, particularly during 2020, we have grown far beyond just Philadelphia. Our community is mostly formed by independents, freelancers, solo entrepreneurs, and a growing population of remote workers. Indy Hall’s main focus is on helping people meet other people they have things in common with. Building that foundation of trust and relationships is our main priority because we've seen these two factors create really powerful businesses. The second business is the one I’ll be talking about in this interview. It’s called Stacking The Bricks and I run it with my dear friend, Amy Hoy. ‍",," Something we have historically been challenged with is setting expectations when we're going to miss deadlines. It’s really stressful to promise something and then have it hanging over your head. So I really try to avoid that in our business by not promising something that's not already done or almost done. Another challenge we’ve faced is that this is neither my nor Amy’s only business, which means that, sometimes, other things take priority. Finally, Amy’s health issues have also been really challenging. She has a serious chronic health issue that has become worse over the years. There are periods of time in which she can’t work. This is even more complicated due to the fact that Amy is mostly the face of Stacking the Bricks. Most people don’t know about me until they join 30x500. People, for example, would write for Amy, I’d reply and they would be like “Oh, who’s Alex?”. ‍",," I want to continue doing this in the future. The business is a vehicle for continuing to help people. I’m still having fun and I’m always learning new things. As for goals, we want to increase access from minorities to the course. There are many people who don’t have the advantages Amy and I have. Therefore, we want to help them by lowering the barriers (maybe through financial incentives, programming activities, etc). ‍",," We met in Amy's kitchen once again and we started brainstorming the topics the 30x500 course would include. We then turned that outline into the first version of the course, which was all written. We pre-sold that one for $300-$500, mainly to people who had participated in Amy’s conference call or who were on Amy’s newsletter. The advantage we had at the moment of starting 30x500 was that we already had an audience, even though it was very small! Amy had been writing about software design and development for years and building trust within the community of designers and developers. It took us more time than expected to create the course, but when people got access to it, most of them loved it. People told us it was because we explained a different way of thinking about businesses. The first few versions of the course stayed written, which had the advantage that it was easy to edit. We actually did four complete re-writes of the course, doing incremental improvements on each case. These versions of the course were really lengthy - it took students around 6 months to complete it. Despite people really enjoying the lessons, we soon found that few were putting into practice what we taught. We realized the information wasn't enough, and that people needed to treat business skills like a real practice instead of just ideas and information.  At that time, Amy had recently participated in a workshop taught by Kathy Sierra, where she explained her unique approach towards teaching and learning programming. Amy took tons of notes about the learning design patterns ideas from Kathy’s workshop, and  we implemented on 30x500. The main thing we did when re-structuring the course was to focus on specific practice-able skills . We also made the course much shorter, focusing on only the most essential skills for a successful launch day: how to find and reach your audience, how to understand their problems in great detail, how to come up with product ideas based on that research, and how to write great sales copy.  Instead of a long 6 month course where people would drop off, the new “Bootcamp” version was just 2 full days of intensive live online instruction, followed by an optional 4 week exercise program.   The Bootcamp took place in a chat room, through which we sent the people short video lessons and demonstrations  they had to watch. After watching each video,  we assigned a specific exercise to practice what they had just learned. Once they finished an exercise, we reviewed their work together providing live feedback and guidance on how they did, what they missed, and how they could improve. This format allowed us to put the emphasis on the practice. The Bootcamp course took place in groups of 30. We taught it 4-5 times a year.  We were making less money initially, but our students were much more successful!  However, after 2.5 years we decided to do a change, partly because this format of the course was absolutely draining for us but mainly because the live format was inaccessible for a lot of our audience who wanted to take the class. People with families and other commitments couldn’t dedicate a full weekend to participate, and people who lived in other time zones didn’t want to stay up overnight for 2 days.  That’s when we stopped selling and teaching the workshop and spent almost an entire year converting the two-day live bootcamp into a much more complete and  entirely standalone self-guided course, now with more than 40 hours of instruction, exercises, guided practice, and tools for implementation That version of 30x500 launched in 2015 and has had thousands of students   enroll since. It’s a hybrid of pre-recorded video lessons similar to our original Bootcamp, interactive exercises to help with practice and self-assessment, and an online community to support and motivate students to keep going. ‍",," Both mine and Amy’s backgrounds are in software development. We both had full-time jobs, which we left to start consulting, which we then left to start our own businesses. In my case, Indy Hall. In Amy’s case, a series of technical eBooks and training and then her first SaaS called Freckle (now Noko). I met Amy in 2007, at a music and film conference called SXSW in Texas. We soon became friends and stayed in touch through the internet as Amy moved to Vienna with her now-husband Thomas. On Christmas 2009, I traveled to Vienna to visit Amy and Thomas. Sitting in the kitchen, Amy and I had a conversation about why our take on business was different from the startup scene of those years. It was 2009, post-recession in America, and there was a lot of enthusiasm and hype for startups and venture capital. But we couldn’t understand why our friends, who had the ability to create stuff, were working for startups (or raising tons of venture capital) instead of selling stuff themselves. That’s when we realized that many of them actually didn’t know how to sell stuff. So we thought that if we started writing about our lessons and experiences building and selling stuff, some of our friends would realize there was an alternative to getting into the startup world. Before Amy and I teamed up, Amy had recently launched her SaaS Freckle and she had been able to get a great number of customers. People were constantly asking her how had she done it so she started selling a three-hour conference call in which she explained the behind-scenes of the business. People found this really valuable and asked her for more information.  That’s when she came to me and told me we needed to teach people who were able to build stuff, help them learn how to start a profitable product business without chasing venture capital .  We first started teaching together on this flagship course originally called “Year of Hustle: Zero to Launch” and later renamed to 30x500. We’ve since launched a constellation of other smaller products all related to the same problem and audience including Amy’s book Just Fucking Ship and my book, The Tiny MBA. All these products and the 30x500 course are part of our business named “Stacking the Bricks”.",," Most of our marketing consists of creating educational content, whatever the format is (podcasts, blog posts, tools). We’re also active within the community of people that we serve, compared to other people that just participate there when they have something to promote. I think that’s something many people miss. Only if you’re a helpful citizen, people are going to look you up, join your email newsletter and end up buying one or multiple of your products. My Indie Hackers profile is the best example of this. We’ve also experimented with paid ads last year, but we had mediocre results. The 30x500 course is mainly promoted when we open enrollment  once every quarter of the year, exclusively through our newsletter and waiting list.", You can check Stacking the Bricks and 30x500 websites. You can also follow me and Amy on Twitter.," I really enjoy Indie Hackers’ community and podcast. It’s really powerful, particularly for technical folks. Having said that, I think that many people spend a lot of time on sites like Indie Hackers, and they could be using that time to study their audience and figuring out what they want.  It's good to have that place to go to and be reminded that you're not doing it by yourself because it can be isolating. But I always tell people that where you put your attention will matter. And if you're putting more attention anywhere than on your customers, then you're probably setting yourself up for some kind of struggle.

229,standuply," For the past 10 years, I’ve been a tech entrepreneur, today I’m 36. In 2008 I founded a web agency in the heart of Russia, in Siberia. Since then we’ve been working on various projects from clients’ work to building our in-house startups. Three years ago we decided to focus on one thing and that’s become Standuply. Standuply is a Slack bot that runs standup meetings and team surveys in Slack. Think of Standuply as a Scrum Master that works in thousands of teams and applies the best practices. Standuply makes money with a SaaS subscription and charges per user. The price range is from $2 to $4 per user. Today Standuply has thousands of customers from companies like IBM, Adobe, eBay and more. I’m the CEO and my role is to grow the business from the marketing side. ‍",," Everything takes time, especially in SaaS. So, we learned valuable lessons. Some of the most insightful lessons came while we were building our MVP: We did tons of interviews. We spoke about customer pain points, workflows and listened to their feature requests. Interviews helped us to see a bigger picture. However, we were surprised that they didn't help us with new features. To move forward, we needed the data on how our SaaS MVP was used and by whom. We didn't have internal statistics at first. It was like flying without radar. I can't imagine how we could work without it. Instead of shipping additional features, we should have built it from the start. We found that having only one tech person on a project may lead to coder's block. One person can get stuck, while several people have a better chance of finding a solution. Therefore, having one developer on the team may come at a higher cost than two.  At the beginning of 2017, we had a beta that was serving about 200 teams. However, it was far from being perfect with regard to features and stability. So we decided to re-write the bot entirely to deliver additional features our users were asking for. Instead of 1.5 months, it took us 4 months. Oops. After the release, the feature of adding answers didn't become popular. This is how we learned that additional features are not that important compared to core features. No matter how many nice tiny things you build, a product's success is about the core features people buy into. Speaking of disadvantages, it’s the fact that not everyone uses Slack. It will be better for them, because Slack increases team productivity and for us so that we could have a larger market.  ‍",," We set a short-term goal to reach $100k MRR which is a turning point for a SaaS that proves the real business potential. However, looking long term, our goal is quite simple, yet ambitious. We would like to provide a chance to have a Scrum Master on the team for everyone who can’t afford it. Number wise it will mean a million happy customers.  We’re thinking long term and understand that it can take a decade or two to achieve that goal. But we have enough patience and motivation to bring it to life.  ‍ ‍",," I and Artem took our savings and started the work. We had a hell of a lot of motivation like there was no second chance. Our team was building MVP and experimenting with the Slack bot API for 9 months in 2016. We changed the concept three times, and at some point, we were almost ready to give up. Later, we were lucky to find focus with the help of the Startup Sauna acceleration program. Some people didn’t like the concept of a Scrum Master bot. Half of them didn’t follow Scrum. However, many liked that a bot can ask questions and gather answers, e.g., for standup meetings. To embrace that, we decided to provide a user ability to change questions allowing a broader set of use-cases. We redesigned our webpage and changed the product’s name (not a good move). It became ReportChef (like a chef that serves reports based on various recipes). After we made our positioning wider, it became unclear to visitors what we were doing. Ouch. At that time about 50 teams were using ReportChef, and it didn’t feel like a strong demand.  We talked with many coaches in Startup Sauna and narrowed our value proposition to stand-up meetings on Slack. That's how Standuply, as a concept and brand, was born. We launched it on a demo day at Slush.",," The story started in 2015, when we launched a list of Telegram bots, BotFamily.com. In 2 months it grew to 2k/daily visitors, but we decided to put it on hold due to various reasons. Later, we launched Ad-Exchange for Telegram bots, BotRevenue.com. VentureBeat wrote a full article about it. In a few days 300 bot devs. & advertisers signed up. But we found that telegram doesn’t reveal any user data. No targeting was possible! Retention in bots was ~0,5%! We gave it up and switched to Slack. Artem, co-founder of Standuply witnessed problems in Agile teams in his career of a Project Manager. Most of Agile teams need to check-in consistently, adjust processes and work on improving the performance. However, it’s easy said than done. We picked the idea, as we saw the solution. It was in 2016 when the chatbot hype was starting. I was excited about the new opportunities and shared my business ideas with Artem. Together, we envisioned a digital Scrum Master. We started with a Slack bot for standup meeting to solve the main problems of checking-in with remote team members and long meetings. In 2016 in a few days, we got 300 teams signed up having landing page only. Now, thousands of teams use Standuply every working day. "," Some people advocate starting to charge from day one. We didn't follow that practice. During the beta, our product was free to use. That decision had its advantages and disadvantages. We attracted more signups that way, but we also had users that weren't ready to pay at all. Sometimes their feedback was distracting and demotivating. So next time I would start charging users earlier to get feedback from real customers.  "," Standuply was featured on the main page of the Slack App Directory in March 2017. In two weeks we got 750 new signups and reached a milestone of 1,000 teams. Even since the feature ended we have still been getting a steady stream of new users from Slack.  We relied heavily on content marketing in 2017 and continue to do so today. I published several long reads. It helped us to improve our SEO and led decent traffic to our blog. My posts received hundreds of thousands of views since then. We launched Standuply and related Slack bot products many times on Product Hunt in the latest two years. At first, it was our initial launch that brought in our very first users. Next launches brought more users on board. We also spread the news about Standuply, Slack bots and our blog posts on Facebook, Twitter, Hacker News, Reddit and on smaller sites. In all, that has brought us dozens of thousands of visitors in the last two years. Also, we had a booth at three conferences in 2017: Chatbot Summit in Berlin, Slush in Helsinki and TechCrunch Disrupt in Berlin. But, as a result, we had at maximum the same amount of signups from the three conferences as on a regular day with zero marketing budget. However, seeing how people react to a message on our roll-up is very insightful.

230,station," I’m Julien, co-founder, and CEO of Station, based between Lisbon and Paris. We are building a unified search for teams.  It’s a browser extension that automatically organizes all of the important resources and knowledge that a team shares across their SaaS applications. We make it incredibly fast to find information and easy to stay up to date with what your team is working on.",," One of our biggest obstacles in the early days was technical. We built Station on a technical stack (Electron) that proved great to build an MVP but challenging to scale and iterate on. Choosing the wrong platform is one of the 18 mistakes that kill startups listed by Paul Graham. We’ve learned it the hard way. It’s hard to know how good a platform is unless you know what you want to do with it (and when you start a company, it’s all in the open), but it’s worth taking the time to make sure you are choosing the right one. You wouldn’t build your 3-storey house on flimsy wooden foundations. The same thing applies here.  Also, building an extension (vs. a browser before) has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that an extension is easier to install for the user, faster to onboard onto hence it’s easier to get the buy-in from an entire team for instance. It doesn’t require a user to profoundly change their habit the way adopting a new browser does. On the other hand, that’s the catch, it’s also very easy to forget that an extension exists. To give you an example, you can use Station in the browser in two ways: hit CMD+E (on Mac) or simply open a new tab. For a while, we didn’t want to go into the new tab because we were afraid it would disrupt the user’s workflow. Nowadays 75% of activity in Station happens in the new tab. Without it, we’d have ¼ of the activity we have today. It’s crazy. With an extension, the stakes to get a user’s attention are higher so you must design your product with this brutal reality in mind. It’s a tricky balance to find between reminding the user your product is here while not disrupting their flow.  Finally, a big mistake we made in terms of marketing and communication happened during our pivot last year. We were really afraid of losing all our active users (but when you pivot that’s ultimately what is likely to happen). We communicated our pivot trying to convince them that we had done this for them and that the new product would fit their workflow. This generated a lot of backlash as many users felt like we had not heard them at all (what they wanted was a chat aggregator, not go back to the browser!). We’ve edited our communication after that episode and didn’t try so hard to convince our users that it was the right solution for them. If you pivot to build something fairly different from what you did before, chances are you’ll disappoint some people. That’s ok, just don’t lie to yourself about it.  ",," We are in Beta with 3,000+ users, 100+ teams testing the product, and 50,000+ users who have requested access so far.  For now, the product is still free and mostly used by individuals. We are rolling out the team features over the next 6 months and will start monetizing shortly after that. The goal is to onboard our first 100 teams this year. The most exciting feature we are building right now is the engine that will automatically organize knowledge and information in a team. We are essentially building an automated graph of all the important resources shared in a team and using that graph to make finding and searching for information incredibly fast. It’s quite a challenging task as knowledge can take many various forms in a company (a note, a task, a spreadsheet, a presentation, etc.) and we have to operate within the constraints of the browser but it feels like we are building something very powerful.",," We relied on 3 core principles: Iterate fast: we shipped the first version in less than 1 month.Learn quickly from your users: we’ve built an online community where we interact daily with our users.Be where users already work: we’ve built it as a browser extension. Early 2020 (right before Covid hit), our team met in Sevilla, Spain for a retreat where we worked hard to ship a first MVP. The new adventure started! ‍ By the summer, we had our first 100 beta testers and 10.000+ users on the waiting list. We limited access to the product so we could reduce the signal-to-noise ratio in the very early days. There is only so much you can iterate in the beginning. It’s key to start with a small number of users.  We have implemented surveys, sent to users at key moments of their lifecycle, that prove vital to prioritize our short/medium term roadmap. We use Superhuman’s HXC methodology to qualify our persona’s product preferences, Profitwell’s methodology for monetization insights and we gather feedback in case of churn. By mid-September, we felt ready and decided to officially announce the launch of our private beta. We received so many reactions it was hard to keep track! Some were disappointed, but overall most understood our decision. Currently, we are working on our team features. We are still in closed beta, focusing on a few selected teams, but we are still following the same principles.",," Before Station I was on both sides of the table: I started an e-commerce platform in Thailand (with my co-founder whom I married 2 years later, my best exit yet!) and worked for a VC firm focused on investing in emerging markets. Ultimately, I found building a company more exciting.  The original version of Station was quite different from the one you can see today. Back 3 years ago my co-founders and I set out to build a browser for work. It was an alternative to traditional browsers like Google Chrome but specifically designed for working with SaaS applications. We grew from 100 beta testers to 40.000+ users in less than 2 years, were elected “Product of the Year” at Product Hunt, went through YCombinator, and raised a $3.25M seed round with Accel in the US. While it all sounds like smooth sailing, we ended up facing a lot of technical challenges (building a browser is hard!) and struggled to find Product-Market Fit with that version of the product (aka retention wasn’t so good). It led us to seriously question our approach and the product we were building.  We looked at hundreds of user interviews, over 2.5 years’ worth of analytics on our product, and every failed feature we had built. We concluded that there were only 2 viable paths for the company: B2C path: while we assumed our users would use Station for work, the vast majority didn’t use it that way. You could see a clear Pareto rule in action there: 70%+ of usage happened in a very small set of chat applications (that include Slack, but also WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram, etc.). Those are not work applications per se. While we thought we had built a browser for work, the reality is we had built a “chat aggregator” for a vast majority of users. If there was an opportunity, it was there: dive deeper and build the best chat aggregator. B2B path: we looked at features we shipped that didn’t work. It’s tempting to just throw them away and move on to the next one. But you can learn a lot from failed features. One such feature was called “Workspaces:” it was like your folders in Google Drive but rather than having files in it, you had links shared across your applications. You could think of it as a collaborative bookmark manager for teams. Individuals liked it (the same way they like bookmarks in the browser) but it never really took off in teams. Why? Because while everyone wants information and knowledge to be nicely organized in a company, it’s the kind of job no one wants to do. The question for us became: what if you could do it automatically? Wouldn’t that be like magic? The B2C path was potentially the easiest one as it didn’t require as many changes to the existing version of the product but we were facing a lot of technical challenges with the stack it was built on.  The B2B path felt more exciting to us. We always wanted to build a product that brings value to entire teams and that makes not only individuals but entire companies more productive. It also felt like this was a real problem we could solve using insights from what we had built before. You know that feeling when you think “Why doesn’t it exist already?”. That was it for us.  While you often hear about “Product-Market Fit”, another equally important concept in my opinion is “Founder-Market Fit” or to which extent you believe to be the right person to solve this problem. "," Lesson 1: Be good at differentiating perseverance from insanity.  This is best captured in this quote by Andreessen Horowitz:  “Entrepreneurial judgment is the ability to tell the difference between a situation that's not working but persistence and iteration will ultimately prove it out, versus a situation that's not working and additional effort is a destructive waste of time and radical change is necessary.” Regularly ask yourself whether you are falling in one or the other category. This “never give up” mantra you hear everywhere from all these “self-help” gurus is truly harmful. Sometimes it’s best to just let go and seek a different path. That’s what our pivot meant for us. And it’s especially hard because that “sunk cost fallacy” is deeply rooted in our primitive human brain. Lesson 2: Be a pragmatic optimist. That sort of links to the first lesson and it’s a more personal take on it. There is one quote from a US naval officer who survived 8 years as a prisoner during the Vietnam war, that stuck with me: “You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end — which you can never afford to lose — with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.” It simply means being a “pragmatic optimist”. It does sound quite paradoxical but that’s the only way you can build a business and stay sane in the process in my opinion. An optimist who can’t face reality will fail to learn lesson 1. A pragmatic without any optimism whatsoever will just give up whenever it gets too hard. Easier said than done but a healthy dose of both is what I’ve learned you should aim for.  ‍"," We’re a product-led company, so we’ve opted for a “land-and-expand” marketing strategy where we acquire one user and then expand from there throughout a team.  With a bottom-up growth approach, you first need to sell the individual value and benefits of the product. A lot of our marketing efforts at the moment are focused on pitching this individual value proposition. We rely on B2C channels to acquire those leads, such as app directories, blog posts, and our social media.  With our previous product, we had two channels that worked especially well: ProductHunt (early adopter platform) and product reviews (spontaneous, non-paid).  As of now, we have not spent any money on advertising. Outside the B2C channels mentioned, we are essentially growing through word-of-mouth.  ‍", Feel free to check out what we’ve built at Station or to read a more detailed account of our pivot in this blog post.

231,stone," I'm a 33-year-old born and raised in London.  I am the co-founder of Stone, a brand developing innovative trade and lifestyle products for the food and drinks industry.  The business began 18 months ago, when we launched our flagship product - the Classic Stone, a notebook designed for chefs. Since then we’ve created a full range of stationery and are about to launch our apparel range as well as an editorial side to the brand.  ‍",," Like so many brands, Stone was born from one idea and a couple of beers. But I think sometimes people forget the amount of time and energy it takes to see an idea through.  So for me, even holding our initial design felt like an achievement.  But we work with quite a specific set of materials so we’ve faced setbacks with sourcing, labor and production costs. But seeing the response of those in the industry towards our products has always reassured me of just how big Stone can become.  On a personal note, I faced the challenges of fulfilling one of the most successful food crowdfunders in history and becoming a dad within a few months of each other (not sure which one was more stressful). Shipping over 4,000 bespoke orders across the world was hell at times. But, and it may sound corny, my kid Beni is one of the reasons why I’m committed to making Stone a success. I just want to show him that if you have an idea and you’re passionate about it, nothing should stop you from making it a reality. ‍  Perhaps that I can be grumpy. If you feel passionate about something you get these waves of enthusiasm and energy. I try and utilize that as much as possible. But it's hard to maintain that. Better people than I can keep those levels stable but my mood can drop at times. I hear that's not uncommon though. The main thing is to be aware of it and manage it.  From a market perspective, we’ve already seen a few competitors, let’s say, ‘borrow’ ideas from the Stone range. We are still a small company so, particularly with our stationery collection, we need to stay one step ahead of big manufacturers like Moleskine. That’s one of the reasons why we’re expanding the range, to make Stone a multi-faceted lifestyle brand with its own unique appeal.  And yes we’ve made mistakes along the way. I could mention collaborations that didn’t work out or wholesale deals that weren’t financially viable but, as I said, I really do think that failures are the most valuable thing. As long as you establish why they weren’t useful, they’re incredibly useful.  ‍",," We want to expand the Stone range in a way that appeals to the pros within our industry. We want to create apparel, accessories, and stationery for the more niche corners of the food and drinks space - baristas, brewers, bartenders. But we’ll only release products that we feel hit the Stone goal of being the most beautiful and practical tools possible. By the end of this year, as we grow both our online store and our retail presence, we’re hoping for a revenue of $500k. Of course, as things grow we may look to bring in a few extra members of staff but as small as the current Stone team is, I think it works really nicely.  But the project I’m really excited about is the Stone Magazine. I’ve always wanted to explore a print publication and the Stone brand lends itself perfectly. Working with a load of food writers, editors and photographers, we want to create an annual magazine and release it worldwide. But we don’t want to be another recipe heavy Sunday pull out style publication. We want genuinely thought-provoking stories told by the most intelligent and charismatic people in the industry, all beautifully presented with the goal of cementing Stone as a true voice of authority in the food and drinks space. I might even take a couple of snaps myself.  Bookblock is also at a very interesting stage as we launch our leather range and consumer gifting website. We have ambitions to really grow this company in parallel with Stone.",," Stone began as a bit of fun. My background is very mixed, from documentary and food photography to UX and marketing strategy. Stone was a meeting of all these worlds and gave me a chance to put into practice everything I’ve learned.  Having always worked for myself I never really had someone explain to me what to do and what not to do. You start at a big agency and from day one you’re learning from people far more experienced than you, which of course is hugely beneficial. But I can safely say that there is no better way of learning then failing. As long as your analytical about it all. It’s a somewhat cliche term these days but failures are the pillars of success.  From an early stage, we decided that Kickstarter was the right platform to launch the product from. Rather than having to work on operations and logistics from day one I was instead able to focus on my strongest areas. One which is a marketing strategy.  Chefs are natural influencers, in that if they like something they will tend to talk about it, and their endorsements will matter. We had created something that was considered a genuinely useful tool and we, unlike a Moleskin, were from the industry so the chefs we were reaching out to were very happy to talk about what we were doing. This was a wave we had to ride.  For two or three months we gifted hundreds of influential chefs. We asked for nothing in return but just let the marketing run itself, bubbling away in the background as we built up our design assets. With very little information out there and chefs popping up on social all the time with our new product, singing its praises, this mystery grew around what we were doing. The only thing people could find was a form to put their email address. By the time we launched our Kickstarter, we had 3,000 emails. This meant that within 24hrs we hit our $30,000 target. ‍",," My family would probably describe me as someone who had entrepreneurial tendencies from a young age. When I was around 9 or 10 I would buy cupcakes from the supermarket and sell them for six times the price to tourists queuing up for Wimbledon tennis… I like to think my business practice is a little more principled now. Having studied documentary photography at university I found myself with a degree that didn't let me move too far beyond freelance work and soon found myself forming a design agency, which I spent the next five years building. The agencies services naturally evolved and we gained a reputation for UX and digital strategy.  As much as I enjoyed auditing businesses and organizations (the majority of our clients were NGOs and social enterprises), helping them develop their strategy and digital presence, I really wanted to go back to the proverbial cupcake selling. So when one of my clients, a notebook brand called Bookblock offered me to come on board as a partner and Creative Director, my core team and I jumped ship.  Fast forward a few years I find myself in a Michelin kitchen with chef Michael Caines and a client, Eliot. Michael has one prosthetic arm and I noticed that when he was using his notebook on his metal kitchen surface the notebook was sliding around, and it gives me an idea... I mention to Eliot that Bookblock could create a notebook with a magnet at the back which would make it easier not just for Michael to write in, but all chefs.  After an hour of bouncing ideas off each other, we came up with seven unique features the perfect chefs' notebook could contain. One of those features was stone paper, a material made of limestone that is naturally water and greaseproof.  I quickly got some prototypes made up in our workshop and got them out to around 80 respected chefs around the world for feedback. The response was incredible and it was clear early on that the concept had legs. ‍", I think perhaps I would’ve set a clearer set of goals right from the start. Stone is always growing and changing and I love it for that very reason but sometimes having one or two concrete targets to hit can help focus your efforts. That and get a haircut.  ‍," The marketing power of chefs really can’t be underestimated. Known for their frankness, their endorsements carry huge weight. That’s why we set out to align Stone with the very best in the game - Pierre Koffmann, Marcus Wareing, Matt Abe. And thanks to the strong existing relationships and bit of string-pulling, we could make that happen. With these names on board, we had a great reach not just within the industry but also out to the public too. We had a nice amount of press coverage when the Classic Stone first launched which certainly helped our marketing efforts but chef endorsements have been key in the long term.   Food influencers have been a big pull too. Writers, food stylists and recipe bloggers have all been happy to post about us and I’ve been really pleased with how authentic those posts feel. We’re not selling chocolate bars or 2 grand sunglasses. The Stone range is designed to be genuinely useful and a lot of our marketing focuses on that.  We’ve had good traction on our own socials too.  We’ve got some great photographers and videographers in the Stone team and we’ve put together some really good content that has drawn us a strong following. In fact, for a while, Instagram was our biggest source of new customers. I’m a designer at heart so I want all our channels to match what Stone is all about - simple, beautiful design.   And now we’re veering away from overtly promotional material and focussing on high production collaborations with top chefs. Our latest video series ‘Written in Stone’ sees great chefs talk about one dish or ingredient and has proved a big hit with followers old and new. It’s kind of the dream method for us - low cost and really effective.  At no point since we launched have we hit a lull with sales. The initial excitement in what was seen as an innovative product has died down, and getting people to talk about us when we are now considered established in the industry is increasingly difficult. However we have found our feet with ad spend, learning about our audience and refining who we target, and because we are ultimately selling a good product we are getting return custom.  My basis of comparison is limited but I think there are consumer brands that get a higher customer satisfaction than us. We never have to go through social and delete negative comments. We just don’t get them, well, certainly not about the product anyway. So I believe we are at a really healthy juncture. We have the foundations right, the principles of the product right and we think we understand the audience. So we are now ready to make the next steps in the business.

I’m the owner and Head Coach. Besides publishing our content, I build training programs for endurance runners, work with private clients, and interact with the community on our social platforms. We’re proud that 98% of our material is free but for those runners who want our best, most strategic coaching guidance, we offer a collection of topic-specific programs, coaching, and custom training plans to help runners reach their goals.  ",," Keep things simple. When I’ve tried to get too fancy, take on more than I could, or build too much complexity into the business then I’ve always failed. My most notable mistake was attempting to create software that would create a custom training plan. I hired a firm to do this, they dragged their feet, and I wasted $10k on a product they never delivered. The real lesson is to know what your business needs to thrive and focus on that - not shiny new things that seem great only in the abstract.  ",,"  Today, Strength Running is thriving! While we have been negatively impacted by the global pandemic, we’re still thriving and growing in some areas. Particularly our podcast, which has gone from the #4 to the #2 ranked running podcast in Apple Music of all time.  We have hired a video editor, content assistant, and podcast editor all within the last 18 months to help scale our content ambitions. In the future, this may be a new podcast but certainly, new training programs to help runners reach their goals.   I’m still running and plan to get into the mountains of Colorado for as much trail running as I can this year!",," Strength Running offers a collection of coaching services and training programs for purchase. The main driver of these programs is our community they’re created to address specific, real problems and needs from runners. The process from idea to product includes a lengthy research phase where I’ll read as many books on the topic as I can, interview potential customers, study other programs, and test early versions with small beta groups. Usually, after 9-18 months, a product is ready for launch to our audience. The pricing strategy depends on the complexity of the program, the cost to create it, the length of time needed to build it, market comparables, and some good old-fashioned testing. ",," I competed in track and cross country for all three seasons during my high school and college years. I’m a true running nerd that loves the sport so I always knew I wanted to work in the industry. I bought the domain name StrengthRunning.com in 2007 but I wasn’t sure what I was going to do with it besides “online coaching.” Finally, in 2010 as I was working as a government contractor outside of Washington, DC, I launched the Strength Running blog. I had previously dabbled in e-commerce and affiliate marketing with very little success and knew that I needed to be more passionate about the topic of my business. Now, 11 years later, I’m still just as excited to help runners! "," Like running, entrepreneurship demands consistency, resolve, and a willingness to fail and keep going. If you’re sensitive to stalled growth, failed launches, or online trolls, starting an internet business is not for you! I also recommend new entrepreneurs build their network of peers, mentors, and colleagues in their industry. Your Rolodex of influential friends can help you launch a product, solve a business problem, or just generally keep you aiming for the starts.  ","  Strength Running has relied heavily on organic traffic from search engines, social media, and other sites. Primarily, our biggest source is organic traffic because we have focused so heavily on our blog content.  I’ve also built relationships with other large sites and blogs and contribute to Runner’s World, PodiumRunner, the MapMyRun blog, Lifehacker, The Art of Manliness, and others.   Social media plays a smaller role and is better for building relationships and connecting with your community.  ", Join the fun on any of our social media channels or platforms!

233,stronger-u," Hey! I’m Mike Doehla. I grew up in Newburgh, New York, and went to school for business. 4 years ago, at 33, I founded Stronger U, a nutrition coaching company of which I’m currently the CEO. Prior to this, I worked in banking for many years and then I transitioned to human resources. I wasn't very happy in that world I wanted to do something more creative. I didn't necessarily see myself as an entrepreneur, but I wanted to work in the fitness industry in some way. That’s how I converted my garage into a gym and began training people. But in the early days, I didn't have a clue about what I was doing. My website was terrible. My gym was cold. Nobody really cared much about it except me. I did that for 13 months working a few hours a night. Then I went completely online and stopped training people to focus on helping them with nutrition (coaching). I then became full-time and hired three other coaches to help me. I decided to make that transition because the training thing was not working it was more of a hobby. In order to grow and to quit my full-time job, I would have had to quadruple the number of people I was training. That’s when I figured if I focused on something I was better at and more passionate about, I could make the transition. In the beginning, the business model was a subscription with a minimum of 12 weeks, though we also sold 6 and 12 months. Today’s model is still a subscription though pricing has changed a little bit from the early days. ‍",," The technology stuff, aligning the team and finding really good people have been the main 3 challenges. The coaches are the most important people in Stronger U so hiring correctly and knowing who's going to be an awesome coach that aligns well with our values and what we’re trying to do as a business, is hard. We don't have any recruiters but we have built a network of friends that generally recommend coaches. I also meet some coaches at conferences. Even some clients experienced in nutrition have become coaches and we have trained them. Some of them become full time, some others part-time.  ‍  I think funding has been a disadvantage in comparison to our competitors. We are 100% debt-free, and everything has come out of our pocket. There are some other businesses in the industry that have received millions of dollars in funding and can grow much more quickly and efficiently.  Another disadvantage is the nutrition market. It's really hard to build trust. Many people have been misled and lied to so many times with other diets that it makes it hard to convince them that our system works. Stronger U offers something quite simple and it almost intimidates people because they don't think good nutrition can be this easy. This is also related to the word of mouth strategy we have mainly used, why we value our members so much, and why we put customer service over anything else. ‍",," We really want to keep growing and help more people. Staying where we are right now would mean helping fewer people and that doesn’t sit well with me. I don't have any revenue goals. My goal is mainly around how many members we help, how successful they are, and how many jobs we can create. I’m much more process-driven I know that if I do the right things every day, our goals will happen by default.",," At first, I didn't have a website or anything. I was just talking on Facebook about nutrition when someone came and told me: “Hey, I want to hire you”. I thought of a price that was fair to ask as I had no proof of concept yet and evidence that what I was going to say was going to work. So I just threw a number out and it was enough for them to be incentivized to follow. After that, I gained some traction from a lot of the first customers’ networks. A lot of the people they knew, wanted help as well. I built a crappy website on Wix that helped me display what I offered. People that were working with me would just send their friends to the website and then these people could contact me through email it wasn’t a sales tool. Soon, many people began to ask about my service, but I didn’t have enough time to coach them all. It would have risked the customer service which is essential for business like this. That’s why I started looking for people who could do a great nutrition coaching job and invited them to come on board with me.",," At first, the goal was to help people with training as I really wanted to work in that field. However, I then started to realize that people’s issues were really around food and nutrition. They didn’t need me to train. They needed me to improve their eating habits. I got sick of watching people suffer and knew I could help, so I dove in. My knowledge about nutrition comes from 15 years of learning on myself, getting certifications, reading lots of books, watching videos, talking with mentors, and things like that. A lot of trial and error on myself as well. I do have to thank those early members for giving me their trust. Without them, we do not exist. At the time I started, there weren’t many people doing something similar online. There were a lot of nutritionists who had traditional offices, but the way we did it was different. We didn’t need to charge what they charged and we didn’t need to have office visits. Everything was virtual.  ‍",," Our marketing is still very bare-bones. We're thinking of hiring someone to help me do marketing, but we're still riding the wave of word of mouth. We just do a very good job with our clients and they grow the business for us. The website has improved a lot since the start, though. Social media helps but to an extent. There are accounts in our niche with 100k followers but are only helping a few people. We have around 35k followers and have helped even more than that.  We have also tried some ads on Facebook but it didn’t really work. In our industry, marketing is more about brand awareness than selling right on the spot. It's hard to sell a multi-hundred dollar service with an ad. Word of mouth is, in the end, what has allowed us to grow to a 70 person staff and 40,000 customers. I think the reason it has worked so well is because of how badly the nutrition industry is failing people. People are really sick of not getting the results they are supposed to get from other diets. We fix that. For good. The dieting industry is a multi-billion dollar industry and it is doing a crappy job. It can help you lose fat, but it doesn't help you change behaviors. It doesn't give you strategies, it just gives you some rules that you have to follow, and if you don't, you don't get results. We're very flexible in that way our approach is to meet people where they are and just try to help them on an individual level without all the nonsense. Pricing the service has been one of the hardest things for me as we grew. We obviously needed to charge more, not only because we’d got better at what we do but also due to the increasing costs of running the business. We had to charge more in order to hire more people, grow,  and improve. But not too much where nobody wanted to work with us. So that has been a really delicate balance. ‍", Here’s Stronger U’s website and Instagram. You can also follow me on IG here.," “Start with Why” by Simon Sinek is one of the bests books I’ve read. It shows you that there always has to be a good reason behind everything you do. Without that good reason, there's just chaos and no direction. But if you have that why and a set of values, then you know everything you do is about that and you can't go wrong. “The E-Myth Revisited” and “Delivering Happiness” are two amazing books as well. I read a bit but don’t consume much information apart from that. I think too many people keep consuming a lot of information while they already have the necessary knowledge to implement. Collecting more information instead of doing isn’t always the best strategy. ‍",,Food & Beverage,,United States,"October 1, 2020",Mike Doehla,https://www.failory.com/interview/stronger-u,"['http://strongeru.com', 'https://www.instagram.com/strongeru/', 'https://www.instagram.com/mdoehla/']",success,1,+$500k/mo,"Mike Doehla converted his garage into a gym and began training people.

234,swagup," I have been selling stuff for as long as I can remember, starting with re-selling our groceries outside of my house to our neighbors. SwagUp started it out of my mom’s house, and just under 4 years later we’ve worked with over 2,500 of the top startups and companies, run a 40k ft fulfillment center, have a team of over 150 (13 in Miami), and have done multiple 8 figures in sales all completely bootstrapped. SwagUp takes the super complex world of branded swag creation and distribution and streamlines it through one simple platform. This saves companies a ton of time and allows them to use swag in ways they haven’t been able to in the past. Currently, I’m based out of Miami, FL, and as the Chief Swag Officer/CEO,  I focus primarily on the long-term vision for SwagUp, Product/Tech Strategy, and building the leadership team. ‍",," Balancing being aggressive with growth with the financial limitations of being self-funded. There’s a lot of infrastructure and team building to do to build this team right and instead of all at once you need to do it piece by piece, given the limitations, so then the decisions become what are the best pieces to build upon and when.  Building on that, most of the biggest obstacles have stemmed from people management and building great teams. It’s the hardest part of any business. Aside from that, trying to make great technical architecture decisions early on and not accumulate too much tech and process debt is also something to stay focused on. This also ties to data integrity and prioritizing that early. Without good data, it makes it hard to make good decisions and build strong processes.  We’ve got many strengths and are in a very fortunate spot. We don’t have the funding others have, but that’s by choice and also affords us the flexibility to make autonomous decisions and not chase short-term growth at the expense of long-term prosperity. We don’t have connections in the industry with the vendors and supply chain and maybe the credibility that other legacy distributors do, but we make up for that with creativity and a fresh approach to a stale industry, which has helped us build up credibility quickly as a company to pay attention to.  ",," We have grown rapidly each year 2x-3x, reinvesting as many profits back into the business as possible. Still 100% bootstrapped and will keep it that way for the foreseeable future. We have about 150 team members, split about ⅓ engineering, ⅓ sales/marketing/admin, and ⅓ Ops. Have made plenty of hiring and team-building mistakes over the years. We are starting to bring in some really strong leaders who we can build empires around and own and specialize in different key functions of the business. Still a lot of work to do there but on the right track. We are profitable which allows us to stay bootstrapped. We want to at least double revenues every year. We want to build a billion revenue business over the next 5-7 years and I think we’ll get there. We’ll need to grow the team, especially engineering, but the idea is to not have to scale the team at the same rate as revenue and continue to be product-led. As a founder, you constantly get inundated with opportunities, and your mind races with different ideas. The key is staying focused and engaged. As long as I am engaged and excited about SwagUp, I will keep giving it 110% and pushing it forward to build the biggest and best business in this industry without the need for outside capital. I like the bootstrapping nature of how we do things, I like the challenge, and always pushing the boundaries and growth, aggressiveness, and risk.",," Started very bootstrap, given I wasn’t technical and didn’t have many technical friends nor funds to hire someone. Used a combo of Wix and Typeform to create an intuitive experience that wouldn’t cost much to get running. Connected that to Trello via Typeform to create seamless workflows to help operate on the backside. Got a few simple Google Ads up early which led to some early traction on validation. Did this for at least 18 months before starting to bring on a CTO and invest in reinventing our systems. I’m a big fan of just getting something out there quick, get feedback, and see where it goes. See what works and then build it and that’s what we did.  This all worked for a pretty long time, but over time our two main systems, our pack builder/swag picker on Typeform didn’t give us enough flexibility to build the UX the way we wanted to and then Trello as a back end project management tool started to fail from the massive amounts of data and files on it. We had no source of truth of data anywhere and we needed to get that figured out. I still don’t think we’ve truly “launched” up until this day. We started quiet, the first 3 years we didn’t say much, just tried to find customers and help them have the best experience possible. Google Ads helped us test the market and virality helped us scale. I’m a big fan of providing as much upfront value as possible, eliminate friction, don’t charge for things you don’t need, optimize for customer experience, trust, and long term potential. ‍",," I dropped out of College of William & Mary junior year in 2015/2016, joined forces with NFL veteran Steve Weatherford on a fitness training business together. From there was at a VC firm in NYC called Brand New Matter briefly where I came up with the SwagUp concept and decided to go full time on it. I had a bit of a background in branded merchandise in college. A buddy of mine and I wanted to launch an app on campus and in the process needed to get custom flags made. They were super expensive in the US. I was able to find a supplier in China to make them. Ultimately decided to start a side business selling custom flags online. This then expanded into shirts for fraternities and other items. I put that on the back burner after partnering with the NFL player but when I got to the VC firm I realized how invested startups were in brand, employee experience, building community, etc and swag plays a huge role in it all...but there was no great company I could think of as the go-to in the market that made it simple and had a great brand. SwagUp was formed to tackle that initially. One of our first large orders happened to be for a swag pack, an assortment of items bundled up 1 set per new hire and we realized we could build a business around productizing and simplifying that experience that was traditionally very messy. From there it’s been a compounding effect of learning more about customers and the industry and eliminating any of the friction points we see, such as handling inventory, global shipments, design, etc all in one platform. We continue to innovate and look to power the industry as a whole. I’ve always been entrepreneurial. I like coming up with interesting ways to sell things. Swag is not new, but the way we approached selling it and presenting it is. Dropping out of school, I also wanted to prove to people I knew what I was doing and would make it work.  Failure is inevitable. You need to be trying things all of the time, which invariably means you will be failing a lot. I had probably started 15 businesses/ideas before SwagUp, all to varying degrees of success. The more you swing the bat, the more likely you’ll hit the ball. The fun part in business is you don’t strike out after 3 strikes and you only need to be right once."," SwagUp is such a complex business with so many different components, like running a fulfillment center, building technology, running a sales team, partnership and channel development, product manufacturing, integrations… there are so many different facets of what we do.  If I had to break it down into two core lessons it would be: Never lose the penchant for action. Keep things moving constantly, always seek to improve and iterate. Get things done quickly and often and keep pushing things forward. Make sure that you instill this dynamic in all future hires so they carry it forward with them. Avoid bureaucracy and hypotheticals that slow decision-making.Hire incredible talent as early as possible. Bringing in great talent compounds. The earlier you can do it the better. They will set up strong processes, they will get the job done well, they will find other amazing talents, they will build their mini-empire. Find these people ASAP and don’t try to cheap out here. I like to spend a decent amount of time on Twitter, it’s the top of the content funnel for me. I find a lot of interesting people, podcasts, blogs, articles, books, etc through Twitter. I have an insatiable curiosity that sends me down rabbit holes that helps me expand how I think about things. Much of the problems businesses face have been faced and even written about. The greatest minds are always sharing their knowledge, you need to go out and get it and then do something about it.  Twitter is also great for finding like-minded people and other founders at your stage to stay up to date with and help each other through similar phases of the business. "," Early Google Ads, leveraging that to get some customers, making sure those customers have the best experience possible and then telling others about it. There’s an inherent virality to what we do because our finished products are out in the world, gifted to people. Recipients always want to know where they came from, which leads back to us. It’s a solid viral loop that continues to propel the business. You just need to make sure at the same time you are investing in the existing customer experience so they retain and expand.  We never really dug into social media and social ads. Facebook Ads testing early on brought a lot of low-quality leads so we ignored it. Sometimes there’s a temptation to do everything, but you can only focus on so much. Test channels but double down on ones working.  Later on, I started to personally get active on Twitter which I think has helped us build a strong community around the brand. The first few months, revenue was pretty low, sub $5k, but it was something, especially given no one knew who we were and we didn’t have much to speak of at that point. We got early inbound leads from startups like Soylent which was very encouraging, as it proved people were likely looking for a better way. After that first order for packs, which was for about $10k, and then our subsequent positioning as a swag pack company, we saw growth take off. The next month we did about $40k and never looked back. I’m a huge fan of Purple Cow thinking and it was clear we had turned ourselves into a purple cow at that point ‍", You can find me on Twitter or send me an email.," We have what feels like WAY too many tools and platforms at this point. But everything is a matter of ROI. If you can prove out it makes people’s lives better, make them more productive, and can build a business case then it makes sense. Our core business process lives in Salesforce as a homegrown ERP and we have a lot of other custom-built software. We use SaaS tools like Slack and Zoom to communicate, Jira for managing product and projects, Lattice for employee engagement, Gong and Outreach on the sales side, Lucidchart for mapping processes, as well as many many more. Tools are super helpful, but it’s important to first evaluate the problem, build a process and system to solve for it, and then layer in the tool. I see way too many people go straight to the tool thinking it will magically solve problems without doing the work to solve the fundamental issue and understand where the tool plays a role.  Some books would be The Purple Cow, How to Win Friends and Influence People, Positioning, Contagiousness, anything about Amazon is super relevant and interesting to me, Competing in the Age of AI, and the Intelligent Investor are all ones that come to mind. I’m always hunting for new books and have close to 500. I also really like the How I built this Podcast (as well as some others) as you get to dive into those early days, scrappy startup stories that remind you that great businesses are built out of passion and grit. ‍",,Design,,United States,"May 18, 2021",Michael Martocci,https://www.failory.com/interview/swagup,"['http://twitter.com/michaelmartocci', 'mailto:Michael@swagup.com']",success,1,+$500k/mo,"Michael founded SwagUp, a swag creation and distribution platform that saves companies tons of time.

235,swipes," Hi, Rich and Failory audience! My name is Stefan Vladimirov. I am 29 years old and I’m a creative director and designer born, raised and currently based in Sofia, Bulgaria. 6 years ago, together with my two partners Kasper Tornoe and Yana Vlatchkova, I co-founded Swipes, a software company for thoughtful and delightful productivity tools. Our journey started in the small Danish town of Aarhus and led us to Silicon Valley and back. We created a successful product in a highly competitive market that earned customer love, industry recognition, awards, and most preciously, a lifetime of learnings and wisdom. But It was not enough. Some of our strengths turned against us and drove us to exhaustion and the eventual shut down of the company. Today I want to share with you what worked and what didn’t work for us. I sincerely hope that, by the time you finish reading this interview, you walk away with something that can help you do better in your business. ‍"," In June we took the hard call to cease work on Swipes. In full honesty, it felt like losing a war that you have been fighting with all you got until the last day. But you know what life goes after and we have been fortunate to have fantastic people in our team, investors, family, friends that applauded us for our tenacity and perseverance. ‍ After the dust settled we naturally asked ourselves the question: Why did we fail? Why indeed? In short—we took poor business decisions. After our initial success with Swipes Personal, we allowed our ambitions to outrun ourselves. As a consequence, we didn’t give enough appreciation to what we have already succeeded to achieve. Instead of putting our limited resources to build our business slowly around this first product, we decided we would make a bigger more successful one building it from scratch. We underestimated the bite we are taking and this decision exhausted us over the years. We tried so many different takes on team productivity and discovered some very interesting design solutions, but over time our vision became blurry and so did our target audience. We were spending months changing our product and marketing, hoping that something would stick, just to face more disappointing results and engage in a new cycle of changes. Today I feel much better and I am recovered from my burn out. And the partnership and friendship between the three of us are stronger than ever. Currently, Yana and I are in the making of a new business and doing what we have been doing in the past 2 years to pay the bills for Swipes: brand strategy and design services for clients. Every day I’m learning more and more. I look back at the Swipes journey humbled at the bravery of our young selves and full with gratitude for what I learned. I am more mindful of where and how I put my energy. And I am more open to adopting new skills and not silo myself into just one thing. I am going acting classes, helping my fiancé start her podcast and daring myself to Downhill Ride. I am grateful and happy to wake up and learn every day. ‍"," Initially, we thought we could easily develop this new product. At that point, we had grown our team to 10 people and had raised more funds from investors. We had also attracted the attention of a prominent entrepreneur and investor from the Valley, to whom I will simply refer as Mister Big. Mister Big was crazy about Swipes and he saw big potential for the app. So he started talking about investing $1M. $1 million US dollars for a team of 25 years-old co-founders who had started 2 years ago... Our ambitions and expectations grew exponentially and our vision blurred. But as you might have sensed, the investment did not go through. We were “infected” with the megalomaniac mentality of the Valley, however. We wanted to build this new collaboration tool that would solve the work of teams in the same elegant manner as the Swipes Personal task list app. But we were running out of runway, and the sensible business decision was to fire everybody, use the funds we had to get to product-market fit and build a profitable business. ‍ The three of us cared obsessively about the work we had done and the people we had been working with. Over the previous year, we had been creating a fantastic team culture and firing seemed like we would backstab our friends. But this was businesses and we eventually had to fire half the team. You have to understand one thing about us as a team. We were obsessed with creating a simple quality experience that delights people. One of our blessings that ended up turning into a disadvantage was our perfectionism and strive for quality. We have spent weeks perfecting a product we had then release on the market just to realize we need to get back to the drawing board. Our biggest misunderstanding was that people loved our initial product because it was delightful to use. Yes, that had a huge part in their experience, but most importantly it was serving them a need in a novel way. Swipes Personal gave our users a superpower to charge through their tasks like a champ and no matter the day to feel a sense of accomplishment. While the rest of the task list apps were focusing on getting organized, our focus was on achieving results, and that resonated with people. With our team product, called The Workspace, we had many novel ideas and daring tested daring designs, but we never succeeded in cracking the value of the problem. ‍  In 2016 Kasper and Yana moved to California. They were in the process of securing a $1M investment, but the relationship with the investor went sour and the deal was off the table. Soon after, I and the rest of the team followed them. At first, it was a new thrilling opportunity. We had been accepted into Alchemist one of the top B2B accelerators. There was a multitude of mentors, investors, and talent that we were meeting all the time. But as exciting the Bay Area was, it wasn’t our place. We met a handful of incredible people who helped immensely with their mentorship (hey Michael Moon), but there were a lot of phony people. Too many for my taste. The Valley was trying to mold us into something we didn’t relate to. What do I mean by that? The whole crush it, hustle, fake it until you make it, go big or die trying mentality just wasn’t us. As a result, we were facing many rejections from investors, partners, and customers. But it was a blessing to understand who we really are and what we stand for. We were 5 people living in a 2-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of Palo Alto, on the other side of Arrastradero Road. Our window was literally overlooking at the cemetery where Steve Jobs was rested to peace. I started to feel resentful towards the place and life in general. And it wasn’t helping the fact that I was a thousand miles away from my girlfriend at the time.  But as difficult as it was, it was a moment I wouldn’t change. During this period, we learned as a team to be truthful about who we were and what we stood for. We eventually returned to Europe, a bit wiser and very exhausted. It was 2017 and we still didn’t have a product-market fit nor a working business. But like the stubborn people we are, we kept on pushing. To extend our runway we raised capital from few American and Bulgarian angel investors among whom Bogomil Balkansky and Vassil Terziev. We doubled down our efforts and released another major rework of the team product. In the product release video, we used our dire situation to form a plot around. There was interest, but not enough, so we continued. Through 2018 and until the end of 2019 we kept reworking and releasing. We eventually ceased to look for investment money and focused solely on doing design and development projects for clients. We ground ourselves to exhaustion. The company we were trying to create was feeding on our physical and mental health. One by one, we were burning out. So eventually in June 2019, we decided no more. It was a difficult decision, a very emotional decision. But it was either the company or our health at the line. We chose the latter. And this is how this chapter of our story ends.",,,," So the three of us sat down and got into businesses. Initially, we started working on a fun dating app. The hard part came from the fact that none of us knew much about dating. Anyway, it was a great start that made us realize working together came along naturally. One evening, Kasper and I were talking about task lists of the app’s development when one discussion led to another and before we knew it, Kasper and I were working on a “side project” that would later become Swipes. We realized that dating was not of our interested and that what we really wanted was to build the best task list app in the market. Kasper made the prototype in a week, while I was fiercely refining the visual design and Yana digging out information about the market and users. At that moment, our skills clicked. In less than 6 weeks we had our product on the App Store and we saw the first couple of hundred people downloading the app. We were thrilled. We kept improving, shipping and having loads of fun. ‍ Our numbers were growing and online media outlets started to notice our product and praise it for it’s simple and delightful design. The first big media review for Swipes was The Next Web and that’s when we hit our first 10,000 users. We didn’t have a business model at that time. The app was free and we were actively looking for funding. In 2014, we met our first angel investor Kristian Ottosen who put the first check for $35k. We felt like winners. Kasper and Yana, who had just relocated to Bulgaria, started to assemble and build a team. The app was steadily growing and people LOVED IT. That same year we did an integration with Evernote, which was the productivity giant at that moment. Our product aimed to deliver untapped value to Evernote users, helping them sort trough tasks. It was a success. We were invited to take part in the Evernote Conference, winning first prize for Best New Startup. Not bad for a team of nobodies. ‍",," Every good story starts with some heroes. Those were me, Kasper and Yana: three hot-headed and talented young minds… Almost like by faith each one of us had the right specialty: design, development, and marketing. But, in reality, each of us had more than one role. I consider myself obsessed with visual aesthetics and design. I am 100% emotionally connected with the work I do. I share the belief that only when you have an intimate understanding of the product and audience you can create a design that doesn’t just solve a problem but gets people to feel like a better version of themselves... it’s about the emotional response. My first steps were in photography, learning to appreciate the beauty and to capture it. My educational background, however, took on a different shape. After finishing the Spanish High School in Sofia, I studied in Denmark, finishing a BA in Marketing and Sales. Yana, who at that point was my couple, took the same education. Fast-forwarding to 2013 we were freshly graduated and aggressively unemployed. At that moment in my life, I had developed a keen interest in graphic and motion design, so I thought to myself: “You know what would be awesome? Starting my business selling design and photography services.” So I did it. And yeah, it failed. I  didn’t get any clients, but it was a far more exciting and valuable experience than being on the job market for a marketing position. Yana, instead, took a path into the newly forming startup scene in Aarhus. Startup Weekends were still a thing by that time, so Yana, being an entrepreneur by heart, spearheaded into the event, formed a team and won the award of the jury. At that point, we were not together as a couple anymore, but our friendship persevered. So when one day she called me and told me that her new boyfriend Kasper was in the need of a designer for his startup, I was in. ‍ Wait so Kasper and Yana are boyfriend and girlfriend? More precisely, husband and wife and their son recently turned 1 year. And yes the 3 of us started a company together because that’s what millennials do. Joke aside. When I met Kasper, I fell in love with the guy (like in a platonic manner!). He was sharp, honest and loved Star Wars. What else do you want from a co-founder? Kasper was working on a startup in London, but after failing to get it off the ground, he returned to Aarhus. At that moment I knew that the three of us would create something together.

Releasing the long-awaited version for Android and crossing half a million users. Swipes was hot. Media was writing about it, Apple featured us multiple times on their App Store banners and lists. We had success, but we were still not a business. Looking back, our biggest challenge was building a sustainable monetization model. We were only thinking about growth - the faster the better. We firstly tried a subscription model, but conversation rates were really low. It was 2015 and people weren’t really keen to pay money every month to use apps. So we moved to another monetization strategy that was far more challenging: team collaboration.  This way, we got into an odyssey of constant R&D and rework that defined the following 4 years. ‍"," You can find me on my personal website.

236,swoop," Hi there! My name is Amir and I'm the CEO/Co-Founder of Swoop. I’m from El Segundo, California. If you haven’t heard of it, it’s a small town located in Los Angeles and also where A Tribe Called Quest left their wallet. Our headquarters currently reside in Playa Vista alongside tech hubs like YouTube and Google. On one side of the coin Swoop is a group transportation marketplace with vehicles for any adventure. On the other, Swoop is developing tech to create a platform for transportation companies of all sizes to communicate with each other more efficiently. One key function will allow vehicle operators to simply hand off trips when they don’t have availability and still earn a percentage of the profit, all while using Swoop’s user friendly software. ",," When we first launched Swoop marketplace we were able to get by with basic tech and a lot of manual input simply because we didn’t have a tidal wave of incoming requests and our team was very dedicated to conquer any swell. But, whenever you’re launching a product in the tech industry you need to have great engineers to develop it for you, otherwise you’ll get left in the dust. Finding the right engineers who were willing to get scrappy while also compensating them fairly was difficult. The rest of the team ran off equity packages and a very minimal salary while doing most of the heavy lifting. We simply couldn’t afford to bring anyone on board to develop what would ultimately increase our profitability. Pretty much the pickle every startup finds itself in. I spent countless hours increasing my coding knowledge while the rest of the team kept Swoop afloat. Knowing how precious time was, I begged my long time friend, Ruben, to leave his job at Facebook and lead the fundraising efforts at Swoop. Thankfully Ruben said yes. He wanted to carve out his own destiny at a startup and wanted to walk the tightrope with us. After a few months of minimal sleep and daily hot-flashes, I got the call. We secured our pre-seed funding and we were able to bring on our core team with a full-time salary along with adding two engineers.  I personally find my greatest disadvantage in managing my time on specific tasks. Being able to prioritize projects in the correct order can give you a huge upper hand, especially in app development. Our initial web app took over 1 year to develop because we were compartmentalizing our time inefficiently. In a way, recognizing this weakness has taught me patience and also helps with attachment issues. There were times the team and I invested countless hours into a project and then suddenly had to scrap it and start all over again because it didn't make sense for the new direction of Swoop. There were also moments we moved on from a task that needed a little more nurturing and this led to some tedious backpedaling. Having gone through these experiences multiple times has brought me a ton of perspective while building Swoop and has actually brought the team closer.  ",," With the world put on pause due to COVID-19 we’ve had a moment to reflect on how far we’ve come and how we should plan to move forward. Our sales took a steep decline, however, we knew there were holes in the industry that needed to be filled and this gave us time to plan accordingly.  Every step we’ve taken at Swoop has been because we’ve learned what our industry is deprived of through our own trial and errors and then we've set out a goal to fix it. We didn't have to wait long to realize the most important thing the group transportation industry lacks is advanced technology. The vehicle operators we worked with were communicating through so many different channels and had so many different processes that the overall experience for the customer was being affected. Some of the operators we came across were still writing down their scheduled trips by pen and paper. Swoop depends on the service the operators provide and their capability to communicate with us. We realized this has been an issue and will continue to be if we don’t do anything about it. That’s why we’ve decided to shift our focus to developing software for operators that will manage their fleet, provide networking features, and much more with an appealing UI. This will provide an environment for transportation companies of all sizes to thrive in. Yes, Swoop marketplace will still be in full swing. This advanced tech will only connect our customers with vehicle operators more efficiently and create a better experience for everyone in the ecosystem. ‍",," Funny thing is, Swoop actually started out as an on-demand service. My parents would lend us the vehicles that weren't being utilized and we would have a few Sprinter vans on the road throughout the weekend. The team downloaded Slack to feel more professional, subscribed to rudimentary on-demand software, and launched what was recognized as “Uber for groups.”  Through this we gained a ton of knowledge while getting a realistic gauge of what the industry was missing. It boiled down to the booking experience. We realized that normal people liked to schedule in advance. Not everyone in the world is a whimsical kid fresh out of a college. Swoop then pivoted to creating a marketplace so mom and pop transportation companies can apply their vehicles to our platform and users can simply book whichever one they preferred. My parents' shop became our first vehicle operator on the Swoop platform. Shortly after we returned the favor by increasing their sales by over 20%. Without my parents and their generosity we would be far behind where we are now. Realistically speaking, we probably would have never started. Moving forward, Swoop is still developing and changing our goals after all these years. We are now focused on creating a community for vehicle operators to engage with each other to make profits from the rides they aren’t able to service. Commonly known as farming-out, this process is a popular theme in the group transportation industry and we’re working to enhance this experience for companies of all sizes.",," How Swoop came to fruition is very personal. My parents immigrated from Iran and started a limousine and party bus company in Los Angeles. From the moment I could crawl I was playing around the office and putting my fingerprints on everything. By the age of three I was handed my first towel and washed a few rims to stay busy. As I got older I gradually became more and more involved in the daily business operations, at an appropriate age of course. Being heavily interested in video gaming and other new technologies that hit the market every holiday season, I quickly noticed my parents’ booking system and operations dashboard were outdated and never got updated. It didn’t strike me as an issue at first, I just figured that’s how things were.  Throughout my college years my friends would always look to me to organize a party bus for them on the weekends because it was a hassle for them to book. They weren’t confident they were getting the best deal unless they visited the lot in person. Over time I saw first hand how the younger generations weren’t attracted to the archaic booking process for limos and party buses but the demand was there. When you set out to build a product, it typically is to solve an issue that you’re fed up with. I teamed up with some of the same friends who were asking me to help them book party buses and we created Swoop. ‍"," Having the wrong goal is more important than having no goal at all. Trial and error is essential to any business. I always laugh at the time we first launched Swoop with the ""Uber for groups"" business plan. All of the Saturdays we stayed up through the night, continuously refreshing our dispatch page to see if any ride requests came through, and if any did, someone would sprint out of the office to grab the vehicle and pick up the customer. We would do 15+ rides in a night with 3 party buses on the road and we thought we were studs. It was nuts. Would it have been an advantage to have started developing the marketplace before an on-demand service? I honestly don't think so. We learned so much about the industry and what it was like to be in the field. Having face to face conversations with customers and hearing their feedback was essential. The lessons learned during that year were more useful to the future of Swoop than getting a head start on our current business model. It created better relationships with the affiliates we work with and drivers on their roster because we had seen almost everything. The time we spent formulating our old business model became the foundation for the Swoop culture we take so much pride in today.  "," From the very beginning we did whatever it took to get eyes on our product. In the early days we applied large Swoop stickers on the vehicles and pulled up to events around town to show them off. We handed out flyers with promo codes and even gave some free rides to larger groups. This worked well to get our name out in the community but didn’t really translate to consistent sales. Next we partnered with bars and restaurants during football season and offered package deals that would provide roundtrip transportation to and from the Rams games. This got more bodies in the vehicles and also led to great advertisement but it just wasn’t enough. As a little more time went on we focused heavily on our social media presence. We had a service that was perfect for influencers to get on board with. We provided free rides in exchange for social posts which expanded our following from around 500 to over 10k in the matter of a few months. By then our branding was on point. Everyone knew what a party bus, limo, and charter bus was, but we incorporated it into their daily lives and made it more relatable. We began to see a heavy increase in web traffic and overall engagement. In order to capitalize on the marketing progress we created, our business development team strapped on their boots to create more opportunities. Peter and Ruben who led these efforts pitched Swoop to become the preferred transportation partner at some of the best wedding venues in LA. This led to some cross-marketing through websites like Wedding Wire and The Knot which spawned into more partnerships at new venues. We then created a wedding planner referral program to provide a commission for suggesting our services. The wedding industry soon became our largest revenue stream. As our ride total grew we stuck to our main goal of always providing a five-star service. This increased our popularity on Yelp which led to more sales because our product had great reviews and lots of them. Simply put, we got dirty at first and did everything we could to become recognizable. After establishing our brand, we grew with the resources around us and kept pace with the culture of the markets we were in. Once we got you in a Swoop, it was game over. Nowadays we've been experimenting a lot. Direct outreach, sales and relationship management have shown the greatest impact. We're leveraging Apollo.io for email outreaches, and Alfred.io on LinkedIn Sales Navigator. In terms of marketing, the leads on paid social sites like Instagram and Facebook turned out to be too expensive. We tried a lot on Google Ads but only got cost-efficient results for specific target audiences. Today we are leveraging our SEO strongly by building backlinks and content marketing. You don't see it picking up right away like on paid channels but it's an investment - you plant the seeds and watch them grow. ‍", You can check out our website here and our Instagram page here.," I generally check First Round Capital’s content. Some books I’ve enjoyed are “The Lean Product Playbook”, which has been helpful to keep us from being stagnant at Swoop during our journey, and “Traction” which goes around good marketing techniques. A great eBook I’ve read is “The Great CEO Within” which advises on great tactics that build confidence within a company and enhances culture. On the side, I consider myself a tool geek. I daily use Slack, Notion, Roam and Jamm.

237,syria-airlift-project," I’m an Air Force officer, a writer, a professor of strategy and innovation, and an entrepreneur. I just released a book titled Eating Glass: The Inner Journey Through Failure and Renewal. I wrote the book after founding and leading a moonshot nonprofit effort to break starvation sieges in Syria using swarms of small drones. The effort ultimately failed. Nothing in my experience prepared me for the emotional and mental journey of a major failure the “fail fast, fail forward” mantra is obviously important but glosses over the very real pain. I wrote the book to help others navigate their own journeys. ‍"," Even as we reached the pinnacle of our success, the stress and breakneck pace were taking a toll. We were badly burned out. Many of us were full-time graduate students at Stanford. I had naively imagined Stanford faculty would embrace our passion for social innovation, but our faculty saw us as hopelessly distracted from our real work of earning PhDs. Dropping out to lead the Syria Airlift Project was never an option because I was still an Air Force officer. The project’s complexity also became overwhelming. The Syrian Civil War grew more complex and brutal with the rise of ISIS (the precursor to the Islamic State), Eastern Turkey became dangerous, and any will to support the Syrian opposition evaporated. I spent months trying to find a way to get our team to Turkey or Jordan without success. We also struggled to keep up with the engineering. Drone technology was still primitive and emerging, and we spent countless hours shaking out bugs and addressing problems. We didn’t have the time or resources to do proper systems engineering. In July 2015, we crashed a drone in a dry lakebed at Stanford. The ensuing brush fire burned three acres. The Fire Department barely contained it.  I had a personal breakdown at this point. I had always prided myself on my ability to shoulder superhuman workloads and thought I was expertly managing the stress. But months of continual effort took an insidious toll. I needed to shift my effort back to my Ph.D. studies, but I felt trapped in the nonprofit we had just completed our crowdfunding campaign and all the funds sat in our bank account. I had no idea how to keep faith with our donors. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t even check email without feeling overwhelming dread.  The team wasn’t doing much better. My lead engineer was badly burned out. Many of our volunteers drifted away, focused on other responsibilities. The nonprofit survived another six months, dead in the water, as we tried to find a way forward. I struggled mightily under the emotional weight. Finally, in December of 2015, we dissolved. ‍  We knew from the beginning that this was a difficult moonshot with a high probability of failure.  The complexity and difficulty of the project were certainly a root cause. We were trying to develop and field an unprecedented kind of technology, on a fast timeline, into one of the world’s most horrific war zones, with almost no resources. So many things could go wrong. The political and legal issues in play were staggering.  Even as we devoted ourselves to the project, we kept asking ourselves, “Is this idea even a good one?” It was hard to know. We tried to responsibly challenge our thinking. We had Syrians on the team and consulted with Syrians and international nonprofits. We talked to people on the ground. But the only way to really validate our hypothesis was to get into the region and start experimenting, which was incredibly difficult to do. So we went a very long way without being able to confirm our hypothesis about the idea’s value. Many advisors urged us to scale back our ambitions. They (rightfully) told us we were doing too much by trying to implement every piece of the value chain ourselves. They urged us to develop our paradigm in non-conflict zones. We sent two teams through Stanford’s Ignite summer business program. Both teams developed business plans for turning our idea into a sustainable business--but both ditched the objective of addressing starvation sieges in Syria, which was our entire reason for existence. I wanted to address that problem, not build a drone delivery company. The project’s overwhelming difficulty aside, the root cause of failure was our lack of a viable business model. We relied on volunteers and a shoestring donor-funded budget. The project depended heavily on me personally, but I had a full-time job as a Ph.D. student and the Air Force would call me back in three years. That put us on a clock. We knew we were barreling towards a crisis but kept kicking the can down the road. I thought if we could just prove the technology in Turkey, we could build a partnership with an organization that might take over the work. In retrospect, the lack of a viable business model was fatal from the start.  I learned a lot about both the opportunities and challenges of relying on volunteers. Passion, humanitarian goodwill, and love fueled our team. That allowed them to perform miracles. Even though the effort ultimately failed, they achieved amazing feats in an extremely short time period.  However, running a team on passion and love brings real dangers. My favorite definition of burnout is “unrequited love”. When you pour your heart and soul into something, you run a real risk of heartbreak when your love goes unreturned. We cared so deeply, worked so passionately, believed so wholeheartedly in what we were doing. The project’s failure left me bereft. It felt like the universe had betrayed me. I’m now much wiser and more careful about being a good steward of both my own passion and the passion of people who work for me.",,,,," I was uniquely poised to tackle such an ambitious moonshot effort because I was an Arabic-speaking cargo pilot and Middle East specialist with a background in robotics, software, and entrepreneurship. I reached out to my network immediately and built a grassroots volunteer team to explore the idea.  This was not a conventional startup. We were all-volunteer, not profit-driven, trying to address a complex, urgent, real-time problem in any way possible. My strategy was to bootstrap support by setting and achieving small, incremental milestones, each of which could earn us more support and funding. I used my own money at first. I spent months in my garage or at the local park experimenting with emerging drone technology, while also recruiting and building a team. I was en route to Stanford to begin a Ph.D. in Political Science, which gave me access to fantastic engineers. We also recruited law students and people with nonprofit expertise, who helped us incorporate as a nonprofit corporation. These first months were incredibly difficult, involving dozens of crashes, multiple engineering re-designs, and countless meetings pitching to people who thought I was crazy. The idea was crazy. But we also started flying drones reliably, airdropping packages, and finding volunteers and supporters who saw potential in what we were doing."," At each stage, I set an incremental goal that would advance our progress and help us win greater funding and support. Our roadmap ended up looking like this: Create a low-budget video of autonomous drones dropping packages, which we could use to show that we were serious and raise some funds. Build drones capable of dropping small packages on 100-kilometer round-trip flights.Conduct and professionally film a major demonstration in the United States, involving Syrian refugees, which would prove that we had everything we needed to take the capability overseas.Repeat that demonstration in Turkey. This dress rehearsal would prove we could get aid over the border if we just secured the right permissions.Fly a single drone over the border and drop medical supplies to a hospital.Assess, partner with a larger organization, and hopefully scale. We achieved the first three goals. A year after beginning the effort, we were reliably flying autonomous fixed-wing drone flights and dropping packages at roundtrip distances of up to 100km. We conducted an amazing demonstration in California and produced a professional video. BBC also flew out to observe and produced a beautiful video story. In the wake of that success, we launched a crowdfunding campaign to fund goals 4 and 5--taking our capabilities to Turkey and then, hopefully, to Syria.  ‍"," I was an Air Force C-17 cargo pilot, tasked with flying cargo into war zones. I also grew up building robots with my dad, taught myself coding, and created numerous software projects in the Air Force. I also spent three years learning Arabic and earning a Master’s Degree in Jordan. Around 2013 the Syrian government began using starvation sieges and medical deprivation to break the will of the Syrian people. In 2014 I did research among Syrian refugees in Turkey, and it seemed like every conversation was about the sieges. I couldn’t stop thinking about the problem. It was impossible to fly big cargo planes into Syria’s heavily defended airspace, so I conceived the idea of building an air bridge using large numbers of small drones. I consulted from the beginning with Syrian activists and aid organizations, who saw promise in the idea. We called the effort. "," I went on to found and lead a second entrepreneurial venture: a drone-focused software development team inside the Department of Defense called Rogue Squadron. This felt like such a gift because I was able to leverage everything I’d learned from the nonprofit. We had real resources. Our team grew to about 15 full-time people. The team was a brilliant success in two years we became one of the most capable small drone teams in the United States government, and we supported hundreds of government organizations with our capabilities. My biggest lessons were deeply personal. Failure hit me hard it took me about two years to recover, and I still have scars. That gave me a lot of time to contemplate the lessons, especially since I was writing my book. First, I learned to be much wiser and more careful about my own entrepreneurial passion. Entrepreneurs tend to be hypomanic we pour our hearts and souls into things and then ride out debilitating crashes. Now I throttle my energy to maintain a marathon pace. I have organized my life around strong boundaries and self-care. I work extremely hard but my typical day also includes time with my family, exercise, adequate sleep, journaling, pleasure reading, and meditation. I try not to let my sense of self-worth become too entangled in my entrepreneurial pursuits, although this is admittedly a challenge.  Second, I now take a much broader view of success and failure. Innovation is so nonlinear the economist Joseph Schumpeter described capitalism as “gales of creative destruction.” We try stuff, the main effort goes sideways, and then unexpected seeds we planted along the way suddenly bloom. My nonprofit failed but we helped start a conversation in the humanitarian assistance world about drones for good my volunteers went on to do amazing things in the drone industry I leveraged my expertise to launch Rogue Squadron.  In my book I write: Each action you take plants seeds in this wild, vibrant, evolutionary jungle. Every investment in a colleague or subordinate could shape that person’s life. Your discarded creative projects become building blocks for the next generation, or for your own future efforts. Work you abandoned will surface in entirely new places, changed and yet mysteriously familiar. Lessons you learned long ago will help you avert catastrophic mistakes in the future.  This view of the world becomes almost comforting. You are not such a big deal after all, and that is okay. You faithfully play your part in the cosmic symphony. You make investments, plant seeds, and cast your bets on steps towards a better future. How much you plant will define your legacy. ",," I invite readers to check out my book Eating Glass: The Inner Journey Through Failure and Renewal. I tell the story of the rise and fall of my nonprofit, but more than that, I help readers understand their own journey through a failure and recovery process. That doesn’t have to be an actual startup failure we all have seasons when we feel stretched beyond our limits, grapple with impostor syndrome or self-doubt, or feel swamped by life. The book speaks to all that. I also blog (sometimes) and have a newsletter at www.markdjacobsen.com."," Everybody loves tools, so I’ll mention that I have a YouTube series called Tools for the Life of the Mind, in which I share some of my workflows, which are built around Obsidian, Zotero, and Scrivener. Beyond that, I’m going to give an unconventional answer to the question. One of the best and most overlooked things entrepreneurs can do for themselves is develop a rich inner life… cultivating a quiet, calm, reflective space in which you prioritize your own well-being and your personal relationships. I think of this as creating a walled garden, to which you can retreat when you aren’t out fighting dragons. This isn’t easy in our chaotic, noisy, hustling world, especially as an entrepreneur. So I’ll share a few resources to help. Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who set out to understand how to live a happy, meaningful life. He finds that control of inner experience is essential and lays out a framework to get there. Jerry Colonna’s reboot.io and his book Reboot helped launch the modern executive coaching movement. Jerry takes his clients on inner journeys through the thoughts and emotions associated with business leadership, which we frequently hide out of sight. His podcast is always rewarding. The poet David Whyte has written stunning and beautiful books about our relationship with work, like Crossing the Unknown Sea and The Heart Aroused. Every entrepreneur should have a sport or an athletic hobby. Mine is rock climbing. Exercise is crucial for health and managing stress, but it can also be an incredible training ground for life. Climbing is a zen sport that requires the complete focused attention of body and mind, which makes it a wonderful balm for anxiety. It also requires a dedication to self-improvement and grappling with continual, sometimes overwhelming fear. The benefits to an entrepreneur are obvious. "," We operated on a tiny budget. In our year and a half of operation, we spent maybe $12,000 of my own money, $3,500 of prize money from an innovation competition, and $5,000 from donors. Because we relied on volunteers, we paid no labor. Most of our funds went into drone hardware or tools. Some companies donated hardware, software, or pro bono services. Towards the end, we raised $40,000 of crowdfunded donations and won a $40,000 grant that we ended up declining. We donated our remaining funds to charities supporting Syrians. We never earned revenue nor planned to. As a small scrappy nonprofit, we sought donations. Our most important currency was relationships. We needed partners who believed in us and supported us. By that measure, we had mixed success. Many people were skeptical but we also found amazing allies and supporters. ",Software & Hardware,Bad Business Model,United States,"November 2, 2021",Mark D.

238,tactiq," Hi, I’m Nick. I’m 35, based in Sydney, and I’m the co-founder & COO of Tactiq.io. Tactiq is a freemium browser extension that transcribes remote meetings, extracts key insights, and creates notes for you. I work as the COO, overseeing operations, finances, hiring, our team, and shared-contribution to strategy/priorities, product, business roadmap, and growth initiatives. As a co-founder at such an early-stage venture, I wear lots of hats. Tactiq is a B2B productivity SaaS browser extension driven by product-led growth - we have a freemium pricing model with paid pro and team accounts. Think Loom or Grammarly, with a similar B2B + B2C distribution, but monetization predominantly through B2B customers.  ",," One of our worst mistakes was experimenting with a new growth strategy without being prepared for the byproducts. We were testing TikTok as a possible acquisition channel. A TikTok creator from Mexico found our extension from one of our paid TikTok collaborations and created a viral video in LatAm, where Spanish is the primary language. But at the time, our chrome extension didn't support Spanish. So we had an enormous spike in new sign-ups, which created a tidal wave of support tickets from frustrated users who couldn't use Tactiq to transcribe their Google Meets in Spanish.  It was an “ahhhh” moment - we needed to test for these types of unexpected outcomes in controlled ways. We had not anticipated Spanish users from our TikTok experiment until then, as our sponsored videos were solely in English. We weren’t ready for that new sign-up volume. There were a few weeks of frantically responding to an onslaught of Intercom support tickets, all in Spanish, toggling between Intercom and Google Translate. We weren't prepared for that unforeseeable outcome that created enormous user churn and resource drain for our team. ",," Over the last year, we’ve had 20x Year-on-Year growth as a business. The team has grown to 7 people. We hired one of my former co-founders, Alex Leonov, as our CTO and, more recently, an ex-Atlassian engineer specializing in team-productivity tools. Revenue is also growing by over 20% month-on-month.  We’re currently hiring and growing our team. We plan to raise a Seed round soon to reach $1.5 million ARR for our Series-A fundraising round.  We have too many ideas to try, so every new feature or concept goes through testing and validation with our existing users on a small scale. Before even scoping a build, we test for feature demand before adding it to the roadmap. So I have hundreds of ideas, but none I can talk about until we try them. ",," Our validation was simple: let the market talk. We followed the tried-and-tested lean startup method. First, we built an MVP ourselves (my co-founder coded it) with no external resources. Then we launched it to the Google Chrome store and began soft promoting it through free digital channels - Twitter, Reddit, Quora, Youtube comments. Within a few months, we had 10,000 users, and that was our validation to say, “Ok, there is a market need, and we have something valuable that people want”. My co-founder Ksenia is a superhuman - she built the entire process. She designed, prototyped, and made our MVP in just a few weeks. It was incredible. I’m lucky to have such a talented co-founder. The biggest challenges were not trying to polish the product too much, finding the courage to put it out there, and getting public market feedback as fast as possible. It was a huge mental barrier because we wanted the product to look good. We had to overcome this internal desire to spend months on the UI and design. In the end, it came down to us deciding to be courageous and click publish.",," Before Tactiq, I was working in AI across Europe and the US, focusing on IT productivity solutions. I completed my MBA and founded another startup, TaskPace AI, an AI management assistant for Salesforce users. It helped managers focus their teams on the appropriate activities in their CRM. I lived in Silicon Valley, but TaskPace’s engineering team was based in New Zealand. This meant many remote meetings, where I noticed meeting productivity was correlated to information recorded during the session. At the same time, my co-founder Ksenia was at Atlassian working on team productivity solutions and saw a similar trend. We both experienced the same problems when it came to remote working environments. We observed that meeting productivity is highly related to the amount of information captured during the meeting. Meetings are tremendously more productive if insights aren’t lost. Initially, we thought that a transcription tool could be the solution. It would record and document meeting discussions to ensure no action items or essential insights were forgotten. But as we worked on this solution, we realized that real-time transcription was just scraping the surface of the problem. Beyond capturing critical information, teams needed to be able to extract important details and insights from meetings. The problem space expanded with an epiphany that it wasn’t just about documentation but making post-meeting action seamless. "," I’ve learned that you need to test things even more than you think you should. It’s why the Cynefin decision-making framework, in particular fail-safe probing, has been a big part of my journey at Tactiq.io. It's how we prioritize our product roadmap, run growth experiments, and bring on contractors/freelancers.  The other thinking I’ve adopted is team-product-fit. Our team DNA is product-led growth, just like our business/GTM strategy is product-led growth. Everyone has worked at product-led growth organizations, or they deeply understand what being product-led entails. This alignment between business strategy and team aptitudes means our team is always aligned. There’s no confusion on direction, roadmap prioritization, etc.  "," For the first months, we didn’t spend any money on marketing. We spent hours manually responding to relevant threads and content on Quora, Twitter, Reddit, and Youtube. We tried to answer everywhere someone posted about saving captions, needing a transcription from Google Meet, or problems with remote meetings. We also commented on Youtube videos about Chrome extensions, meeting productivity, tools for online classes - you name it.  These tactics netted us our first 10,000 users.  Since then, we’ve grown to 190,000+ users and had success with Tik Tok influencers, posting content on Youtube, blog posts, product-led growth, and word of mouth.  We got to our first 10,000 users within months.

239,tailor," Hey there, my name is Joe d’Elia and I am 25-year-old software developer from London. I was born in Italy and grew up near Verona, but moved to the US in my teens. I’m currently co-founder of Upscope (a screen sharing software).  I started Tailor a couple of years ago because I wanted a simple solution to A/B test and optimize websites. It allowed you to define different versions of a page and show the most relevant to a user based on various attributes.  At that time, this sounded like an amazing idea to me, but the truth is that I hadn’t done any previous research. On the typical A/B testing platform, you have to start a test, create some variants, test each on them on your site, evaluate the results and implement the winning variant. I simply wanted to test a variant on 10% of the traffic and then show the winning variant to other 90% of the traffic. So basically people would be able to skip all the evaluation process. Also, I was planning to create some statistical analysis to find patterns on the experiments, but I didn’t have any sort of Statistics expertise apart from High School AP Stats. So this kind of worked, but only for large websites. If you had a small website, it was really unlikely to see any major difference in terms of conversion. The business model was a simple SaaS, based on the traffic of the websites. There was a free plan for websites with under a certain traffic per month, and then, prices varied from $29 to $99. ‍"," The number one problem with Tailor was that it didn’t really work, but that could have been fixed. I didn’t really know what I was doing from a marketing and sales perspective so I had all these users I didn’t onboard at all. I expected traffic to keep coming and people to write about what I had built, but it didn’t work like this. I believe that if I had partnered with a marketing guy, we would have been able to get some new customers, but at the end, it would have failed, so the waste of time and money would be much more. Anymail Finder was also growing a bit at this point so I decided to focus on that. Before shutting down the product, I emailed everyone telling them I was going to do it and made sure that the code of Tailor was not going to break their websites."," My main mistake was not doing enough research and validating the idea of the product. I spent 90% of my time building the product and 10% on marketing. And even the product wasn’t that well built. I still had a lot to learn. I hadn’t learned much about marketing from Anyemail Finder as it was a cool product that people wanted it and they just kept coming back. But Tailor wasn’t a cool product and I was trying to connect with the wrong audience (small websites). Another mistake I committed was carrying out the 12 startups in 12 months challenge. I would recommend everyone who is considering this to create a product and stick with it to grow it. Also, there was a big disadvantage on the market that was the enormous players, which offered free options. Small websites would rather go with Optimziely. ‍",,,," I built Tailor in PHP because that was the only language I knew at the time. Specifically, I used Laravel. It took me about 2 months, working almost full-time on the project. I learned PHP in middle school and then bought some online courses and books to keep improving and to learn Laravel. The initial product looked like crap, and no one understood the landing page but I kept refining it until I had a better design. I also requested for some design help. There was a major problem though: my maths was completely broken and my product did very little more than choose a random option. As for obstacles when developing the product, I wanted to build a visual editor, but that was super difficult and it was only me. I spent a lot of time trying to build it but, in the end, it didn’t work. ‍",," I went through a phase of starting a bunch of different products in a short period of time without really seeing any of them through beyond launch. At that time, I was doing freelance web development, but I didn’t want to work for somebody else anymore. And that was when I started to follow some Twitter people, who now represent the Maker community, and found about their philosophy of launching products and trying if they work. Pieter Levels was also launching 12 startups in 12 months, so I decided to try to do the same thing and discovered if it worked for me. If you are a developer, you don’t have big problems creating a new product. But I did have them getting customers for the products. I just wanted something that did well from the launch, so I couldn’t stick with anything. One of the first product I launched was called Targeting Monkey, and allowed marketers and web developers to easily incorporate the user's location and environment into a website, without the need to set up a complex back-end system. By including a CSS file at the top of the pages, this tool allowed marketers to show/hide things depending on the user's environment or incorporate his location inside the company text. Before stating Tailor I had also started Anymail Finder (my first SaaS) and it was doing alright (around $2000/mo) but I didn’t really know how to grow it further. I, therefore, decided to start a bunch of other products. I’m not sure where the idea for Tailor came from, but I knew I’d use something like that. I was probably trying to do some A/B testing for Anymail Finder but found the existing A/B tools a bit too focused on the stats and I didn’t really care about that. I wanted to set a bunch of different options and then trust the system to choose the best one."," I would stick to Anymail finder and try to learn more about marketing and sales instead of thinking slow growth was a product issue. Also, I wouldn’t try to do it alone! I have co-founders for all my current projects and it makes an enormous difference!‍ ‍"," When I launched Anymail Finder, I shared the link on Hacker News, which went pretty well, and soon a guy re-posted on Product Hunt.  So when it was time to launch Tailor, I just shared him the link and he published it on Product Hunt, which meant a lot of traffic. I also placed an ad on Anymail finder (which used to be called thrust.io at the time). I didn’t really know what I was doing, but around 800 people signed up.  But that’s all. I really didn’t focus on marketing, which was a big mistake. I was trying to follow that pattern of launching X products at a certain time, so I couldn’t spend a lot of time on marketing. ‍", You can follow me on Twitter at @thejoedelia.

The main cost was the time I spent on it, and that would probably be tens of thousands in dollars. If I wasn’t building that product, I would have probably done consulting and freelance projects. So in the short term, it was a great loss of money. However, in the long term, it wasn’t.

240,taleship," Hola! I’m Sergio Mattei, an 18-year-old entrepreneur and developer from Puerto Rico, and I make things like small products and startups. It’s my passion to do so, and have been shipping things since I was 10. I’ve shipped a variety of things, but my biggest products so far have been Taleship and Makerlog. Taleship was a social writing application that encouraged people to take the time to write every day, writing stories with friends. It initially began as a small side project, and when selected to attend the Microsoft Imagine Cup world finals, evolved into a full-fledged startup. Although it never reached this stage, it was planned to reach sustainability by offering an education SaaS, as this industry was showing much interest in the project. This never materialized. My current project is Makerlog, a dead-simple task log that helps you stay productive and ship projects faster. It works by allowing you to build in public, and receive positive reinforcement from others. It really keeps you productive! It recently launched on Product Hunt, where it met great success (#4 Product of The Day, peak #3). People really enjoy the project, and I enjoy making it, so it’s a win-win. I also learned quite a bit from my past product, so applying those lessons learned to a new one has been an interesting experience. ‍"," There were three main factors that caused this failure: ‍ 1) Hurricane Maria Let’s begin with the first and the biggest: Hurricane Maria. I spent about three months without electricity and bad internet access. This was a rough period of time - especially because of the difficulties we were going through at home. To put this in perspective, I spent a month without assisting school, and I could only sit down and work on Taleship at night. During the day, I was busy with the daily struggles of being without gas, water, or electricity. The hurricane was an intense blow to Taleship’s operations, and unfortunately, came at exactly the worst possible timing. I was smack middle in the process of writing proposals and setting up test trials for entire interested schools. Schools were paying for Diesel and repair costs - who would buy the product? As it turned out, nobody did. We lost all prospective clients. Although it was difficult, I do feel proud of my actions during this time. I’d spend most nights improving the product, reading, and preparing for even the slight possibility of getting business. In fact, I overhauled the whole SaaS, fully finished the education offering, and planned a full relaunch of the service. ‍ 2) Inexperience marketing My inexperience marketing and inability to find a good marketing consultant impaired the possibilities of revival, big time. It halted growth completely after the press faded, and in hindsight, I could’ve done MUCH better. ‍ 3) Lack of passion. This one put the nail in the coffin. By the end of this whole ordeal, I was no longer passionate about the problem I was trying to solve. I was having more fun buried in code than actually trying to make the startup successful, so I stopped. I decided to shut down the service. The shutdown process was simple: we gave a period of time for everyone to save their stories, then shut the servers down on the specific date. What wasn’t simple though, was my emotions after it. I felt mixed feelings - on one hand, I spent months crafting a product, and it felt like a baby to me. In another hand, I felt relieved that the load was off my shoulders. Working on it felt painful, and I finally had time for other ideas. I managed to move on to other projects (like Makerlog) which have turned out much more successful."," The biggest challenge was probably the MSFT Imagine Cup world finals... and it was tough. It all started in the first meeting - when I was introduced to a developer experience advocates at Microsoft Puerto Rico, who would eventually teach me the art of pitching, user design & experience, and handling the press. Also, we brought in a marketing specialist who taught me how to pitch my product with emotion and appeal to the hearts of the judges. During this intensive period of trial and error, that lasted about two months, I perfected my pitch and presentation to deliver to the judges. I also began getting much press attention for Taleship. This was one of the best learning experiences of my life, and I utilize all this knowledge on startups and pitching every day. The public speaking aspect has improved so much - I went from an introvert to confidently giving public speeches anywhere, anytime. After the two months, the deadline arrived, and Microsoft flew me to Seattle where I’d compete with 51 other teams around the world. After intense pitching sessions and demo showcases, I managed to make it to Quarterfinals, top 32 world - as a 17-year-old solo indie hacker. I would say that was the biggest challenge - the competition. What I did wrong? Well, in hindsight, I could’ve utilized the press attention much better. Mostly, they all fall down to marketing. ‍",,,," Taleship’s development story was… interesting. In general, building it was very, very fun. I’d spend all day coding Django, and writing a reactive editor using React. Quite the unusual combination, but I made it work! Using much feedback from friends and family, I also refined the user experience and removed most bugs. However, I also ran into a few obstacles while building it. ‍ The first obstacle was picking a stack. When starting out a new project, one of my weaknesses is the stack selection process. I’m always on the lookout for new technologies (they intrigue me!), and this affects my decision-making process when starting out. However, this obstacle quickly became a lesson learned after a week suffering through the ordeal. I just decided “screw it, I’m going with Django”. And it worked very, very well. The new technology I sprinkled to make it magical was WebSockets (using Django Channels). I had never dealt with it before, and using it was a very pleasant experience. Seeing things update was magical! I also got the chance to up my open source contribution game, by helping out with Channels’ documentation. That was also fun. ‍ The second obstacle I came across was time. As a high school student, I was in a situation where the time to make would be minimal and I had to make the most of it. In hindsight, I did some things I shouldn’t have done, like skipping certain class periods for feature sprints (don’t do this!), but my stroke of luck with getting selected for World Finals made it worth it. ‍ The third was marketing. I was completely new to. This one I was not able to overcome, but I learned very much from it. I launched my product on Product Hunt, where it had moderate success. That’s about it, really. I had not learned very much about marketing back then, and that’s something I wish I had done right. All in all, making Taleship consumed about 5 months factoring in the full-time work to prepare for the competition. It was worth it, though. Incredible learning experience.",," As a maker, I love solving problems - especially those of great social impact. A little-known fact about me - I love to write! As I sat down to write one night, I wondered: “why don’t I ever have time to do this?”. After thinking, I came up with a set of three simple answers why:  Content consumption vs. creationLack of time: school and projects consuming most of itInconvenience: sitting down to write is inconvenient. Then it was clear it was a problem I could solve. Using the technical know-how I acquired from previous products, I embarked on my biggest project yet - changing the way people write and updating it to the 21st century. ‍"," I’d probably take marketing much more seriously, and tell myself to stop working on it after the hurricane, as all that was wasted effort. I wished I spent less time coding, and more time giving it exposure. Which is a failure I aim to correct on my newest venture. And I think I’m doing well. Another thing at first, I was worried about competition in the market. I eventually realized it didn’t matter as much as I thought it would. Innovation is about taking ideas and making them better, and I did that with writing. ‍"," As I explained before, marketing was extremely weak. I launched in Product Hunt, posted in a few aggregators… and that’s about it. Due to the competition, the app was receiving a fair bit of press local and international, but I never took many advantages of it. ‍ Product Hunt was relatively successful, however. After launching the product there, an influx of users entered the site and bumped up the stats with about 40-50 signups. It did not go high up on the board like my latest launch (Makerlog), but enough for a considerable amount of traffic. A tactic that did not work, however, is the typical attitude of “if you build it, they will come”. This does not work, and I learned it the hard way. ‍"," Thanks for reading the interview!

241,tali," Hey there - My name I Matt Volm. I’m currently 33 years old, a dad to two young boys, and the former CEO and Co-Founder of a now-defunct VC-backed technology startup called Tali.  Tali was a timekeeping solution for lawyers powered by voice technology like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. With Tali, you could record your time via voice (“hey Alexa, tell Tali to log 12 minutes to the Hanson divorce matter”), and Tali would take what you said and turn it into a time entry form that you could sync to your existing billing system. Tali was a SaaS product, so users could purchase a monthly subscription ($12/user per month) or an annual subscription ($120/user per year). We raised nearly $1.0M of venture capital to fund the business and ran the company for nearly 2.5 years, but ultimately wound things down due to lack of product-market fit.  "," We had some hiccups early on, every startup does, but we continued to grind away throughout 2018, and what a grind it was. During 2018, we focused heavily on improving the product. Everything we did had a positive impact on user experience and engagement, but nothing really moved the needle. Our average daily active users (DAU) crept up, but was never greater than 10% of our total paid user base. We were able to get a lot more people activated because of the onboarding improvements AW and Hoi made, but our free trial to paid conversion rate (those users that started with a free 30-day trial and then converted to a paid subscriber) never rose above 3.0%. We were growing our paid user base each month, but growth was slow (only 10% — 15%) and driven mostly by direct sales efforts (which meant unsustainable unit economics). We even reduced the price from $30/user/month to $12/user/month to see if this would help drive sales, but it didn’t. We ended 2018 with around 250 paid users, more than we had at the end of 2017, but because of our price reduction, our MRR remained flat at roughly $3k. By December 2018 I knew we were in trouble. At this point, I had raised nearly $1.0M and we had 2.5 months of runway left. I went to our current investors to ask for another follow on, and they all said no. I tried to find angel investors that would write some smaller checks, and they all said no. I even tried to find some later-stage investors that would write a larger check, but they all said no too. We weren’t going to grow our way out of this problem, and we weren’t going get additional capital either, which left us with two options — put things in cruise control or zombie mode, or shut things down. I think the most difficult part in this process was simply admitting the fact that shutting things down was an option. As an entrepreneur, you need to solve your way out of a lot of problems and the odds are always stacked against you. So how do you know if this is just another one of those things you need to plow through, or if it’s different? Here’s what I did.  Talk to your mentors My initial thought was we would just put things on hold at Tali for a while until we figured out what was next. We’d keep the technology up and running, do support requests and demos as needed, but would otherwise do as little as needed to keep the lights on. Me and my team would go and get day jobs to pay our bills, and once we “turned the corner” with Tali we would jump back in full time. Sounds like a great plan, right? Turns out, not so much. I wasn’t able to admit that shutting things down was an option until I spoke to two of my mentors. Both had founded multiple companies in their lifetimes, some succeeded but most failed. They gave me the same advice — putting things in zombie mode is a dumb idea. “Give this thing everything you have over the next few weeks, and you’ll either go out in a blaze of glory or you’ll turn things around. Anything in between is not a viable option.” With these conversations, zombie mode was off the table, and we were either going to turn things around or shut things down. Because of these conversations, I was finally able to admit shutting down was an option, and actually say the words out loud. Doing this was incredibly freeing, and took a huge weight off my chest.  Consider and reflect on everything you’ve done After I spoke to my mentors, I went to the drawing board to reflect on everything we did up to that point and asked myself “is there anything I’m missing or anything I haven’t tried?” I looked at this mostly through the lens of our go-to-market and growth strategy, but also considered our product approach. I tried outbound sales, but unit economics were not sustainable. I tried digital marketing, but the results were poor. I tried Google Adwords and SEM, but this was expensive and conversion rates were low. I put reseller agreements in place with technology partners, but these weren’t driving any volume. Blogging, webinars, etc. all produced the same results — nothing seemed to be working. I even went to other startup founders, asking them if they had any recommendations or tactics I could try. All of their ideas were things I had already experimented with, which didn’t yield positive results. Then I looked at the numbers and realized that, at our average growth rate, it would take us 26 months to reach cash flow positive at our current burn rate. How on earth would we even make that happen if we got day jobs and were focusing LESS on the business?  Is a “one-step” pivot viable? By “one-step pivot”, I mean keeping one foot planted on the ground while lifting the other and moving it in a different direction (versus a two-step pivot of lifting both feet off the ground and completely jumping in a different direction). Up to this point, our strategy was to be a horizontal SaaS company, one that was building a time and billing solution that could enter other industries outside of legal, rather than building a vertical SaaS solution just for attorneys. However, since we launched our product we had a long list of feature requests from our attorney users that were not focused on time and billing — things like taking notes, adding calendar entries, and assigning tasks, to name a few. We hadn’t prioritized these legal-specific things before, but could we build and launch any of them within the timeframe we had left? It sounded like a one-step pivot — we were still focused on voice technology for our existing core user but would expand our use case to go beyond time and deep within legal (something we hadn’t previously planned). Turns out this wasn’t a viable option, at least not with the time (or money) we had left. Are there any options left?  Can you sell? We had spent nearly $1.0M and the last two years of our time building Tali. We had built a voice technology application for a business that worked, something we believed (and still believe) will be core to future enterprise software products. So we asked ourselves — “would anyone want to buy what we’ve built?” We had a few conversations, but nothing that ended up working out.  No more options After I went through all of the options above, there was only one thing left — winding down. So that’s what we did — our attorneys started the legal process, and I notified all of our investors, partners, and users to tell them that we’d be shutting down, and then closed the bank accounts. "," We were first-time founders, so everything was brand new to us. We had never raised venture capital before, built a product from scratch, or tested sales and marketing techniques, along with a whole lot more. While this was a significant challenge we had to overcome, it also helped us throughout our journey - we had no preconceived notion of how things were supposed to be done, no bias from our past experiences.  ‍",,,," While the idea for Tali may have been sparked in my dining room, it didn’t get it's true start until one random afternoon a few weeks later. At the time, I was working in Strategic Finance at HealthSparq, a healthcare technology company in Portland, Oregon. It was here that I met two other guys named Matt — Matt Anthes-Washburn, or “AW”, was a product manager and Matt Hoiland, or “Hoi”, was a full-stack dev. During a hackathon at HealthSparq, Hoi and AW had created a chatbot named Charli that would answer all of your health insurance questions based on your specific member benefits (I know, pretty awesome, right?). The ease of the conversational user interface attracted me to this project, and it was our joint passion for conversational UI that initially brought us together. As a non-technical person, I had no idea how any of this stuff worked. To be honest, I was pretty ignorant when it came to technology and just took for granted that stuff like my iPhone did what I needed it to do. But I wanted to learn more about how Charli worked, and also how something like this Alexa time tracking solution would work. So I asked them to meet up after work one day, and I quote, “teach me how AI works” — such a simple request, right? After we got together, Hoi and AW ran through some basics associated with AI in a way that a non-technical person like me could grasp. Then I told them about the problem my wife was having, and the proposed solution I had recommended. Before I even finished my sentence, Hoi was penciling stuff out on paper on how that could work, meanwhile AW was doing what AW ultimately does best — teaching me what Hoi was penciling out, how it would all work, and what it would mean for a potential user like my wife. Within 30 minutes we had a proof of concept sketched out, and I was convinced that we had something special — not necessarily in the form of a product (although I certainly hoped that would be the case), but in the form of a team. You had me, the business Matt. You had AW, the product Matt. And you had Hoi, the technical Matt. So the next weekend, over donuts and blueberry pancakes at AW’s house, we decided to make it official — we were going to start a company together. Idea? ✔️ Team? ✔️ Product concept? ✔️ Funding? Nope. One of the benefits (and pitfalls) I had as a first-time founder was naivety. Once you have an idea and a team, all you need is a pitch deck and you can go out and raise some money, right? That’s what I thought, and so that’s what I did. Hoi (the technical Matt) is not only an all-around coding ninja, but he’s also a top-notch designer and creator. He shot a high level product demo and some other footage, which he edited into a professional-looking 60 second video that I could share with investors (click here to see this original video). In addition, I prepared a 15 slide pitch deck outlining what we were trying to build at Tali. With these two things, I started sending every early-stage VC a cold email asking for a meeting. The response rate was, in one word… *sigh* underwhelming. This isn’t surprising — I was a first-time founder, we were pre-revenue and had nothing more than a product idea and a team that I *thought* could build it. But then we experienced our first bit of good luck…I got a response from an early-stage VC out of Los Angeles and we scheduled a phone call. I spoke to one partner for an hour, and he then referred me to his other partner, who I spoke with a few days later. Two phone calls with two people a few days apart. I got a term sheet the next week. They wired me $150k the following week. All of this without ever meeting in person, just two phone calls…this fundraising thing isn’t so bad, eh? Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong wrong. Turns out fundraising was a giant pain in the a$$, and I heard “no” more often than I heard “yes”. I’m not going to get into fundraising here, but we ultimately went on to raise ~$750k in total to fund the business (round was rolling, so we collected one check at a time from a variety of investors over the ~2.5yrs we were in business), but this first check and investor is what made all of that possible. We started the company in February 2017, received our first investment in June 2017, and launched our paid beta product in September 2017, six months after we initially got started. In terms of actually building the product, my two co-founders (e.g. Product Matt and Technical Matt) did nearly all of the work (we did use some contractors as well, who were close friends, so we knew their work was quality). We considered outsourcing some development work but ultimately determined that managing an offshore development team would be more time consuming and actually give us less control over the product and codebase then we wanted. Our strategy at Tali was to get a paid product into market as quickly as we possibly could. We wanted to do this for two reasons: Technology risk — we wanted to prove that our solution could work end to end, meaning you could log your billable time with Amazon Alexa and get that time entry into your billing or invoicing system, all without manually filling out a time entry form andMarket risk — we wanted to prove that people would be willing to pay for this type of solution On the front-end or input side, we started with a focus solely on Amazon Alexa (we later added Google Assistant). In addition, we built a simple web application that a user could access online to see all of the time entries they captured with Tali (we called this the Tali dashboard). Last but not least, on the invoicing side we started with an integration approach — rather than build our own invoicing and billing system (which would require a lot of engineering effort and take time), we chose to integrate with Clio, a legal practice management solutions (we later added PracticePantherand Rocket Matteras integration partners as well). We went to the market at a price point of $90 for a three month subscription (or $30 per month). This price point was higher than our competitors, but we didn’t focus on this — instead, we looked at the value we were delivering to our user. If a lawyer bills out at $300/hr then each six-minute increment of their day is worth $30…surely Tali could save you more than six minutes over the course of a month! We included a free Echo Dot to sweeten the deal for our customers, but also to avoid the objection of “I don’t have a smart speaker for my office so I can’t use this software.” This product — the Amazon Alexa skill, the Tali dashboard, and the Clio integration — priced at $90 for a three-month subscription (with a free Echo Dot) is what we launched in September 2017 at the Clio Cloud Conference in New Orleans…and people loved it! 💜 By December 2017, our paid user base had risen to 101 people from all across the globe. At $30/month, that’s $3,030 of monthly recurring revenue (MRR)…not bad for a product built mostly on nights and weekends by a team of three! We launched, and then we realized we had a problem. When a user created an account and submitted their credit card information for a $90 purchase, which got them three months of Tali, they were making a unique, one-time purchase. We never built in the functionality for the subscription to automatically renew. 🤦‍♂️ This meant that everyone who had signed up would need to submit their credit card information AGAIN, or a second time to keep their Tali subscription going. You’re probably cringing right now, which is the appropriate response. This meant I had to reach out to every person, all 101 people, to ask them to submit their credit card information again. I e-mailed 📧 I called ☎️ I e-mailed again 📧 I called again ☎️ After all was said and done, I managed to get 22 people to submit their credit card information again. Let me do the math for you — that’s a 78% churn rate…ouch. 😟",," I grew up in a small town in Wisconsin and was the first person in my family to go to college. I focused on accounting and finance, and my first job out of school was as a CPA. I only lasted a few years as a CPA, and then moved into corporate finance, which I did for a few years as well before going to graduate school, attending Berkeley Haas School of Business and getting my MBA. After my MBA, I did management consulting for a few years, but ultimately went back into corporate finance, which is what I was doing before starting Tali.  As you can see, my career path has been rather meandering and includes a variety of experiences. I always thought that starting a company would be fun, but had no clue how it was actually done. Tali was my first startup, so before starting the company I had no idea how entrepreneurs came up with ideas for their startups. I thought you had to be an engineer, ultimately solving some very difficult problems with a complicated piece of technology. Turns out, I was wrong.  The idea for Tali all started one night in my dining room. My wife is an attorney, so needs to track every six-minute increments of her day in order to appropriately bill her time. She tracks all of her time using pen and paper, and will then spend a few hours each week at our dining room table manually entering this data into her electronic time and billing system. I saw her doing this one evening as I was setting a timer with our newly purchased Amazon Echo, so I randomly threw out the idea “hey, wouldn’t it be great if you could just tell Alexa to track your time for you, and she would turn it into a time entry form?” My wife thought it was a decent idea, so I went out and spoke to as many other attorneys as I could. I learned that they had the same problem around timekeeping, and thought a voice application through Amazon Alexa would be a novel way to solve their problems. After this initial customer discovery, I thought the idea had some weight, so went to form a team around it.  "," Two things: I would have run more experiments in verticals outside of legal, such as accounting and consulting, which also have a pain point around timekeeping. This could have given us the option to pivot and focus on a different industry with potentially more growth potential and initial traction. I would have focused less on voice technology as the core of our product. Ultimately, our product was not able to meet the expectations of our users because the voice technology we were leveraging just wasn’t where we needed it to be so we could be successful. If we would have coupled voice technology where it made sense with an improved visual and on-screen UI/UX I think we would’ve been successful.  ‍"," We tried everything - inside sales, Google AdWords, Facebook Ads, reseller arrangements, etc. etc. - but nothing ended up working. Near the end of Tali, sales were slow and only growing about 10%-15% per month. We reached about $3,000 of monthly recurring revenue (MRR) but nothing we did on the sales and marketing side seemed to move the needle.  This was mostly driven by our target customer, which was a solo or small firm attorney. Because of this, account sizes were typically small (less than 10 users) and our price was also low ($10 - 12 per user per month), meaning our average revenue per account was $100 or less. This meant we couldn’t afford to spend a lot of money to land these smaller accounts in a profitable way, and we never ended up figuring out an efficient way to spend our sales and marketing dollars in a way that generated favorable unit economics (e.g. customer acquisition cost when compared to customer lifetime value).  "," You can check out my LinkedIn, Medium and Twitter."," People. Hands down, the best resources an entrepreneur can have are the people they surround themselves with. I do my best to constantly expand my network, leveraging tools like Twitter, LinkedIn and e-mail to reach out to people (typically cold outreach) I want to meet.  ‍"," We ran Tali for nearly 2.5 years and spent about $750k during that time (most of our spend was spent on salaries/labor, marketing, and travel) We did have a revenue generating product, but were only generating ~$3.0k of MRR at the time we wound things down.  ",Software & Hardware,Bad Market Fit,United States,"October 11, 2019",Matthew Volm,https://www.failory.com/interview/tali,"['https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewvolm/', 'https://medium.com/@mkvolm', 'https://twitter.com/heympv']",failure,0,,"Matt created Tali, a timekeeping solution for lawyers powered by voice technology like Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant.

242,tally," I’m Marie, 32 years old and born and based in Belgium. I have a background in Marketing and founded Tally together with my co-founder Filip Minev. We are a small team of 2 based in Belgium, Europe and Tally is completely independent, self-funded and bootstrapped. Tally is the simplest way to create forms, without knowing how to code, and for free. I’m responsible for everything marketing-related and everything operational that comes with running a startup (customer support, administration, etc.). Filip is the technical brain behind Tally. He designs and develops the product. Tally is a freemium SaaS tool. We offer unlimited forms and responses for free, combined with a paid Tally Pro subscription that unlocks a set of empowering form building features. ",," Our startup story isn't one of immediate success. Because of COVID, we had to pivot and reinvent ourselves. I had just quit my job to launch a startup in travel when the pandemic hit. Finding a new startup idea and deciding to pivot was not an easy thing to do, as well as not earning any recurrent income during 2 years. ",," We launched Tally one year ago and have now reached 12,600 users and $6,000 MRR. We want to stay bootstrapped and are not planning on hiring anytime soon. Our first goal is to become RAMEN profitable and create a sustainable lifestyle business for ourselves, while building the most powerful form builder for SMB’s out there.  Our end goal is to have the financial freedom to support our family and work wherever, whenever and on whatever project we want.",," We shared our MVP for the first time with friends and family in August 2020. Our MVP was a very basic version of the form builder, you could insert questions and that was it. You couldn't even publish a form. We didn't have an extensive network of our own, so we started sharing our first version of our form builder with the people closest to us. After processing their feedback, we started with cold outreach to creators, Indie Hackers, and startup founders who might be interested in our product. We scanned Product Hunt and Twitter, made lists of hundreds of prospects, and started doing cold outreach, asking for their feedback. Often without success, but those who did take the time to reply became part of our community of early users and ambassadors. We kept our pricing simple and didn’t want to bombard our users with countless limits and paywalls. Tally is a freemium product, 99% of all features are free and you can create an unlimited number of forms and collect unlimited responses for free. Why so free, you might ask? We were entering a competitive market, and offering free forms without limit is one of our main differentiators. We launched Tally Pro (at $29/month) a couple of months later with a set of advanced features aimed at teams and startups.  We launched publicly in March 2021 on Product Hunt and shared a checklist of how we went from MVP to Product Hunt launch. Our launch was a rollercoaster and we ended as product #4 of the day. We doubled our user base (from 1,500 to 3,000 users) after the launch and Product Hunt has been an instrumental step in gaining exposure. ",," End 2019, me and my partner Filip Minev decided to chase our dreams. I was marketing manager at a Digital Product Studio in Belgium and Filip had left Delta, a crypto portfolio app he had built and was acquired by eToro. We wanted to build a product for the rising influencer marketing industry while traveling and working as digital nomads. A couple of years ago, we got the idea when traveling in Mexico, a hotspot for travel influencers and bloggers. Hotspot was going to become a platform that helps hotels to connect with travel influencers and set up collaborations. We were going to build the platform if we could find 100 hotels that showed interest in our idea. We made a landing page and reached out to hotels we found on Instagram. We used a Google form to collect data and weren’t really happy with the way it looked, but we didn’t want to spend too much time on it and moved on. In no time, we found 100 hotels that were interested in our product and noticed most of the traction came from Asia. Beginning 2020, we had a growing number of hotels and influencers on the platform, and we both decided to go for it. I quit my job, we rented out our apartment and booked a plane to Bali, with the first stop in Bangkok. Once we arrived in Bangkok, the pandemic hit and countries were going into lockdown. Customers started churning or asking to pause their subscriptions. Flights were being canceled, and suddenly going to Bali and being stuck on an island with limited healthcare facilities didn’t seem like the safest thing to do. Borders were closing, and to stay in Thailand we had to leave the country to extend our visas, without knowing if we would be able to get back in. We ran out of options and had to fly back to Belgium. We felt like Hotspot could grow and didn’t want to give up on our startup idea so easily. So we decided to keep building and prepare for better days. Fast forward to summer 2020. COVID-19 hit Belgium hard, and hospitals were overwhelmed. We decided to organize a fundraiser and donated free hotel nights to healthcare workers. Again, we needed a form for hotels and healthcare workers to register and we struggled to find the right one. Google Forms is very functional but doesn’t look great, and established form tools like Typeform, Jotform, Formstack make you hit a paywall fast and can be very expensive for early-stage startups or indie makers. By now, we had lost half of our Hotspot customers, and with no perspective on when the travel industry would recover, we decided to pivot and build our own form tool. We wanted to make a simple yet powerful form builder that allows you to create any form without breaking the bank."," It's okay to say no. You can not satisfy everyone when you have a small bootstrapped team, but that's okay.The art of persisting. Every day, I'm replying to emails, answering questions and writing help docs.

So, just ask! "," We have to thank our growth to a combination of a lot of smaller strategies and channels: Building in public and sharing our startup story and milestones has helped us to gain exposure with fellow Indie Hackers and founders. Product led growth: most of our users are free users and share a Tally form with a ‘Powered by Tally’ badge on it.Referrals: we launched a startup-, educational, non-profit, and affiliate program.Community building: we built our own little community with early users and supporters that helped us to spread and promote Tally.Content marketing: we’re creating a lot of help documentation and tutorials about form building and new features.

243,tandem," My background is in digital marketing and product development. I’m currently a co-founder on Shogun, a web page builder for any existing website.  "," Various. First, the content just wasn’t really interesting or engaging. We thought it would be good to be able to see a live stream from a fitness influencer, and it’s just not as engaging as viewing live action gaming per se. Second, really difficult to get good stream quality on mobile at the time (this was a couple years ago, we built from scratch in about 6 weeks, no funding). Third, we realized that FB and IG were the ideal platforms for this. We offered better monetization opportunities for streamers a la Twitch, but… Fourth, monetization on our end seemed to be an unlikely sustainable business model. ‍  Taught me the value of true market validation. Tandem was consumer, so much different than Shogun, but it didn’t feel like we were really increasing value for our users. That kind of true market validation was elusive.  It made me appreciate the validation from paying users on Shogun (SaaS) a lot more, I felt like Shogun was really worth persisting on.

244,tandem-app," Hi! I'm Will and I'm a software engineer / product manager from San Francisco. My co-founder Peter and I are currently working on a weight loss coaching app called Intent, which helps people lose weight through small changes. We previously worked on Tandem, an app to help people stay on top of their medications. We tested our hypotheses in a 120-person pilot and built an MVP of our app, but found that adoption and retention weren’t what we expected. ‍"," We didn't observe the adoption and retention we expected with our initial MVP, and decided that the path ahead, while still possible, was made dimmer with the market realities we had observed. I'd break down our challenges into two sections: 1. Insufficient consumer interest. There are multiple medication reminder apps available today, but we needed to believe that there would be a larger audience than the <1M currently active American users of those apps who might be interested in trying something we built. We thought if we delivered a differentiated product experience, people who otherwise didn't seek help with taking medications would be interested in trying us out. We struggled to prove this. 2. Poor retention. Some of our users tried out the app for a few days, but didn't last past the first week - more than we expected. We thought that the combination of push notifications (and optionally, companion notifications) would mean very high stickiness for anyone who takes the time to set up their medications, but this didn't play out. We should have anticipated the acquisition and retention challenges, but we didn't, and that's largely due to the pilot we had run. We tried our best to set up the 120-person pilot as a clean experiment - we requested informed consent, compensated participants for their time, and specified primary endpoints upfront (NPS and adherence). But we underestimated the generalizability of a pilot with recruited and compensated participants. We misunderstood the enthusiasm we saw in the pilot as broader enthusiasm, when really it was just enthusiasm influenced by the study environment and compensation. At the end of the day, if people aren't very interested in a tool to help them take their medications more regularly, it doesn't really matter if you can measure X% efficacy or Y NPS of a solution that no one is going to try in the first place."," Digital health is a tough space. We observed several other companies before us trying to tackle medication adherence, and if they started as direct-to-consumer, at some point they inevitably pivoted to prioritizing enterprise partnerships. Unfortunately, those same consumer challenges - adoption and retention - follow you into enterprise pilots as well, and when an enterprise isn't able to see meaningful utilization and efficacy with their target audience, it’s a struggle to win those deals too. We were enamored with designing and validating the right interventions to improve adherence, when the much larger existential question was whether consumers were even interested in the first place. We should have recognized upfront that finding strong acquisition channels was a necessary precondition for this whole project to work, and we should've done some early testing (e.g. some Google or FB ads with simple landing pages) to gauge the difficulty ahead. I believe we would have had a path to monetization if we figured out acquisition, but more generally, it's possible the area of medication adherence may be intractable, absent breakthrough technology, stronger incentives, and larger market shifts (e.g. doctors and the healthcare system prioritizing adherence). ‍",,,," We wanted to first test our thesis: that tailored interventions would actually help people take their medications more regularly, and that people would be interested in that help. We recruited 120 American adults on Mechanical Turk, all of whom took medication regularly for a chronic disease and had access to a cell phone, and ran an SMS-based pilot for six weeks. We segmented the group into six categories: Control: SMS medication reminders onlyLogistics: reminders + help refilling medication, pill organizerSocial: reminders + support group or help from a companion (e.g. spouse, family member, friend) via SMSFinancial: reminders + lottery incentives based on adherenceKnowledge: reminders + content about their medications and chronic illnessesTailored: all interventions We built a custom admin tool to help us manage sending and receiving SMS through Twilio, wrote custom SMS content, and constructed an automated system to send out reminders, replies, and scheduled content. We also asked participants to complete pre- and post-study surveys, which were compensated. User satisfaction was high throughout, the dropout rate was surprisingly low, and we observed that intervention groups - particularly the ""tailored"" group - had improved adherence (adherence improvement was almost 2x the improvement observed in the control group). Many of our participants appreciated the various interventions we delivered: It was a really good thing to have my daughter involved. It was a bonding experience I felt that she learned more about my illness (diabetes) and she helped encouraged me to learn more, too. And when she sent me those little notes of congratulations about doing well taking my meds, well...that was priceless!My wife was able to get plugged into the medication discipline without feeling that she was nagging me, so it was positive.I will be very sad to see the daily reminders go. I will have to re-install one of my alarm apps, and they just don't have the same effect.After reading the lesson, I think twice now about eating a sugary product. The damage that sugar can do is a real eye-opener.I kinda missed getting the text the last few days, it made me think about why that was. I think this texting service would be perfect for an older person, living alone. Not only as a reminder to take their medications, but to make them feel less alone while dealing with their health issues. I'd even consider volunteering to work as such a service if there was one nearby. Based on these results, we felt we were moving in the right direction, so we decided to build an initial MVP of an app that would begin to deliver these same interventions. We picked social support as our first feature. We offered the app for free and planned to grow a base of free users. As we built out the product, our monetization plan was to partner with pharmaceutical companies and payers (e.g. insurance companies) who would be interested in solutions that would be adopted and can genuinely improve adherence. We designed and developed Tandem, an iOS app that offered medication reminders and also allowed you to specify a companion who would be notified by SMS if you didn't take your medication. ‍",," My co-founder and I are interested in health behavior change - we previously spent time doing research in molecular biology and behavioral economics - and we knew that many people don't always take the medications they're supposed to (ourselves included!). Over 60% of American adults are supposed to take at least one medication daily, but half of them don't. The common estimate is that medication non-adherence results in up to $300 billion in avoidable health care costs. We talked with professors, conducted surveys on Mechanical Turk, and spoke with individuals who take medications regularly. The more we looked at the problem, the more we felt like there was a gap between the research behind medication adherence and the solutions available in the market. Most people will say they didn't take their meds because they forgot, but that's usually cover for a larger set of underlying reasons (e.g. they don't trust their doctor, aren't sure why they should be taking the meds in the first place, don't have the time or money to fill their prescription). Given that non-adherence is a multi-faceted behavioral problem, we believed we needed to develop interventions that would address each of these challenges. ‍"," We should have focused on validating the market first - i.e. whether people would be interested in help with medications beyond those already using basic reminder apps, and if so, how we could reach them. Just because the problem exists doesn't mean it's ready to be solved. Relatedly, on the product side of things, we should have been more concerned about how our product would encourage adoption - not just efficacy. Medication adherence is hard because many people don’t really care too much about their medications, and the benefits of taking them are usually far in the future (e.g. taking meds now will reduce the risk of heart attack later). That means a tool that helps people take their meds won’t naturally produce any sort of “aha” moment until much later, if at all. We should have spent more time figuring out how to quickly show a person why medication adherence matters. There are a few techniques that we could have explored, like providing financial incentives (perhaps from an enterprise partner) or being more deeply integrated with healthcare systems. ‍"," We first launched the app to our pilot participants, many of whom had expressed interest in trying the app when it was ready. We also posted on relevant disease-specific forums where there would be people who take medication regularly. Since we believed our companion feature was differentiated, we also tried to target companions (e.g. young adult children or spouses of people who take medication regularly) through Google and FB ads, and built a simple web setup flow so that they could get the app entirely set up for their loved one. We were able to get several hundred users through these techniques in the first few weeks, but found paid acquisition cost-prohibitive, given the app was free, and didn't have a deterministic way of continuing to grow our user base. We explored the possibility of primary care physicians or nurses recommending or even setting the app up for their patients, but the doctors we contacted told us they wouldn't have the time to do so. ‍"," You can check out our old Tandem website, and feel free to message me on Twitter if you want to chat further. We've since been working on weight loss with Intent. Weight loss is a space that has considerably stronger consumer demand than medication adherence, but it’s an equally, if not more, challenging behavior change problem. Our thesis is somewhat similar - weight loss isn’t just a willpower problem, tailored guidance matters - and we’ve been able to prove this out with some strong traction from (paying!) customers so far."," I've recently been listening to episodes of How I Built This by Guy Raz: he interviews a diverse set of founders, and it’s fun hearing about how other founders navigated the early days of what would eventually become successful companies. ‍"," We spent a few thousand dollars on the pilot and didn’t generate any revenue from Tandem. Overall, we spent about 7 months on the project, including build time for the pilot machinery, the pilot itself, build time for the app, and post-launch marketing. When we decided to shut down, we notified all of our users that we would stop further development on the app but would continue to support their usage (e.g. server cost, SMS companion reminders). The app isn’t available on the App Store anymore, but we still have some users who have Tandem on their phones and use it regularly. ‍",Health,No Market Need,United States,"February 2, 2019",Will Sun,https://www.failory.com/interview/tandem-app,"['https://tandem-app.herokuapp.com', 'https://www.twitter.com/iamwillsun', 'https://www.intentapp.com']",failure,0,,"Will is a software engineer based in San Francisco, who co-founded Tandem, an app to help people stay on top of their medications.

245,teacher-finder," I grew up in the south of England, studied at university, and dropped out of a computer science degree. I did a few bits and pieces of jobs in London and traveled in Asia before finally ending up in Budapest where I live now as an expat. I started a business to help match language teachers with students. It was born out of me trying to be a language teacher, realizing I wasn't very good at it but found I was pretty good at finding students and being able to link them with other teachers. I built a website for that, and that was Teacher Finder. It had some success and then it started to decline. Because of that, I needed to search for new work. Zapier was one of the tools I've learned to use when building Teacher Finder to automate parts of it. When I found myself with more time, I started freelancing using Zapier. It developed into my current business, an agency called Luhhu. ‍"," We started in Budapest and we launched internationally at the end of 2015. For the first two years, it was good. We were getting more traffic to the website, more inquiries from students. We were making more successful matches, we were learning, and doing well in cities. In early 2018 it peaked, but then it plateaued and then started to decline. We were getting less traffic, fewer inquiries. We noticed there were other apps and websites doing similar things. We were competing for spots with Google. Where we had been number one for a particular search in a city, we were dropping down to two or three. That was translating into fewer inquiries. We thought about how much energy we put in to get these top spots in cities and realized it had translated into not so many students, and not that many teachers. There was no way we could create new German, French, or English teachers. There was only a limited amount of demand for finding teachers. We estimated we'd probably hit that in most cities. It was bringing in $3,000-$5,000 a month, which was good, but we realized you couldn't build a big business off that. If that was the peak, then it wasn't going to be a project that was going to last forever. ‍"," We got to a point where we had a nice balance in enough cities to bring in enough money. It was always a little bit difficult. We had a pricing model where teachers paid us a fee, once they've had four successful lessons. If a student dropped out before that we wouldn't charge the teacher. We'd only charge a one-off fee. We weren't taking a percentage of their earnings, which I think teachers liked, but we had to constantly get updates from teachers. As that scaled, it became a labor-intensive process of chasing up teachers, getting updates, sending them invoices, getting payments. It was difficult to automate that. ‍",," At the end of last year, we were in 60-70 cities. We found out only about 20 of those were doing matches. We stripped back to 10 European cities, and we concentrated on core languages like English, German, and French. It took a lot of the workload away. We've used Zapier to automate every tiny little bit of the business we could. It's turned into a business that takes a few hours to run a month. It's making anywhere between $500-$1,000/month. I still enjoy the fact that we're helping a select number of teachers find work in their cities. ‍",," I built the original website in WordPress. Right at the very start, it was a WordPress website and a Gravity form. A big Google Sheet was running the whole operation, and Zapier automated the process of matching up teachers, getting updates from them, and sorting out payments. After some time, I migrated away from that Google Sheet and built a custom backend using Bubble.  We were constantly battling in some cities. There were loads of teachers, but not too many people looking for teachers, or at least not looking online for them. The reverse happened in some cities. In Germany, we always had plenty of German teachers and English teachers, but we had a surprising amount of demand for Spanish teachers. We didn't have many teachers. In Hamburg or Munich, we came to find there were only two or three really good, full time working private teachers. But they had more students than they could handle. We had a lot of students contacting us we simply couldn't help. It was very hard to scale. In some cities, we will try to bring in more demand, and in some cities trying to manage more supply. Keeping that seesaw balance was difficult. ",," I thought I could teach English. I didn't have any qualifications. But people would probably want to speak to a native speaker. I had a little bit of success, but I didn't enjoy teaching. I had a bit of experience with SEO and I could build a half-decent website. When I started to get inquiries of people looking for a teacher, I started referring them on to other teachers I knew and I realized there could be a business here. I would refer the leads on and I would get a small referral fee. I built the website out a bit, and I put profiles on there. I started thinking about other cities in Europe like Berlin, Madrid, Barcelona, where people would be looking for teachers. ‍"," I wouldn't do a marketplace business again. With my new business as an agency, we have a skill, we sell it, people pay for it. There's no managing a supply and demand side. I would also have focused on online lessons. We focused on matching people that wanted language lessons in person. But there are lots of logistical issues there. In a big city, you might have a student in one part of town and a great teacher in the other. They might be a great match, but they're not going to travel for one hour to see each other. We weren't even covering a whole city. I’ll focus on a marketplace business where the supply and the demand were online, and there was no managing the logistics of that. ‍  Just start and start simple. We started without automation. It was just me managing every request we got and finding teachers. ""Every business could be boiled down to something really simple."" You're not going to lose any money building a business like that. You might not make any money but if you do, that’s a great situation to be in. Keep your costs less than what you're earning. Don’t get into debt. Don't depend on the business. Build out the business by reinvesting your earnings. As you start to earn more, you can invest in more apps and more automation, but always keep it in perspective. Think very carefully about marketplace businesses. Most people start these types of businesses because they've realized they've got a supply or demand for something and they just assume they’ll be able to match that up. But quite often, it doesn't work out that way. ‍"," We didn't do too much in terms of finding students. We didn't do too much outbound marketing. We had blog content. I think we crept up on Google search. Someone searching German teacher in Berlin would probably find us in the top listings. We never had problems finding students. In terms of teachers, my partner spent a lot of time on message boards for expats in different cities posting, looking for people posting about being teachers, and posting about work. We would go to other teacher listing sites, contact people through there, and try to recruit them. It was a lot of hustle looking around anywhere where expats or language teachers were congregated online, and just messaging them finding out if they had availability, and convincing them to sign up. ‍", Here’s a post where I talk more about Luhhu's story.You can also find me on Twitter and LinkedIn. ‍," I like to read the newspaper and I've signed up for a bunch of different newsletters on finance, tech, and startups.

It has been very useful. I meet lots of interesting people there.

246,team-voice," Hey there! My first entrepreneurship endeavors started when I was 8, when I decided to begin selling my old toys in school and on the Central Square street market. I remember setting up my “booth” I made from a couple of cardboard boxes and standing next to a few dozens of elders who were selling handmade socks, old electronics, and some other scrap. Business was going well, but because it was still USSR with communism values, when somebody told my class teacher about my enterprise, I was publicly shamed in front of the whole class and forced to shut it down. I still remember that day as if it was yesterday, and I couldn’t understand what I had done wrong. Thankfully, my parents supported me. Since then I’ve had many attempts to earn money myself. On the professional side, I learned computer science and business management in university, web-design started as a hobby and turned into a side hustle, when I was designing and hand-coding websites for friends of the friends and small businesses. For the last 8 years, I’ve been learning more about UX design and product development, understanding the needs of the customers and coming up with solutions to help them achieve what they need.  "," The problem we were trying to solve turned out to be a human problem, not a technology one. And, as one of the well-known venture capitalists said, human problems should be solved by therapists =) At the end, I realized that even though our target audience – HR professionals – understood the importance of employee engagement, they were too overloaded with daily routine tasks (e.g. interviewing, screening, writing job descriptions, etc.). They didn’t have time to sit down and think about the strategic stuff that we were trying to solve - engagement and retention. Even though all of them said it was one of the things that kept them up at night, they just had too much tactical stuff on their plate to carve out some time to do something about engagement. What this meant is that there is lack of understanding of how important employee engagement is by the people who allocate budgets for different departments. So, in order for us to sell our product it would require a much larger effort to educate and convince CEOs, or CFOs, or other execs who manage company finances. Considering our daytime availability this would be a very challenging task. And I decided that I didn’t have enough time and resources to tackle this challenge.  ‍"," Finding time to meet with my pilot group and test product iterations. I was a full-time employee with a strict work schedule, and it was very hard to get out of the office during the work hours. And in B2B business your customers are rarely available after hours. I didn’t feel good asking for their time after work, when they were going to their families after another stressful day at work. If I had more flexibility with the work schedule, we’d had better progress. And sadly, I couldn’t afford quitting my job as I had to pay bills and support my family. ‍",,,,,," Even though I’ve launched a few unsuccessful startup initiatives before, Team Voice was my first official one, with a 50/50 co-founder, incorporating, legal, accounting fees, etc. Why did I decide to invest so much time and some money into solving this particular problem? I strongly believe that people spend a huge chunk of their lives at work, and I noticed that lots of people I talked to were unhappy at work. It doesn’t make sense to waste so much time doing something that makes you unhappy. Everybody deserves to live a happier life. Coming from my own experience and noticing the same patterns when talking to my friends and colleagues, I concluded that there is a gap in safe and secure communication between employer and employees. The standard tools (e.g. annual engagement survey) with a bunch of their flaws didn’t work, and there was a need for a tool that opens up this communication channel uncovering what’s broken in the company, so they can act on it before their employees leave. ‍"," Hard to say, considering my situation I think I did what I could. Maybe, ask for money before building anything, but not sure if that’d help if the main challenge was with educating of the execs in each client company separately.  Start validating the problem you are trying to solve as early as possible. Use prototyping and testing constantly. Don’t be afraid to ask for money.  "," In brief, lots of iterations and lots of testing with my target audience. I started with showing a few paper sketches and “pitching” the idea to the HR manager of the company I was employed at that time. Then, I also reached out to all my LinkedIn connections and asked for introductions to people they knew from HR industry. As a result, I’ve got a list of a bit more than 10 great people that were super helpful and were willing to be a part of my pilot group. Lots of user research, lots of thinking, lots of doing, lots of testing and iterating. Rinse and repeat. As for the marketing strategies, we were still working with the pilot group of people when we decided to shut it down. I tried some Google Adwords and word of mouth options, but no large marketing effort."," I wrote a case study going through my design process and research on my personal website.

247,teamometer," My name is Sergio Schüler, I am 38 years old. My background is in marketing and I currently work as a product manager at a startup called Wunder Mobility, in Hamburg. Even though I live in Germany, I was born and bred in Brazil with a 4-year stint in talent development in Norway and India. But what we will talk about here is mostly about one of my entrepreneurial attempts that failed miserably: a startup called Teamometer, where I was the CEO, product manager, UX designer, janitor... Teamometer was a SaaS team assessment tool to help teams to perform at a higher level. It would assess the teams’ strengths and weaknesses via a questionnaire, then it would suggest how to address those issues.  This is a pitch video I did:  "," There are several reasons that contributed to it, but for sure the main one was that we didn’t have a valuable enough product and we failed to validate that. It was certainly nice and interesting. Literally 100% of the feedback we got from those that used it said something on the lines of “it helps me identify issues with the team”. But that was not enough to buy the software. Worst yet: a big part of the software could be easily replaced with a spreadsheet or a Google Form (why didn’t I sell that as an MVP?)  Teamometer was not like water in the desert, it was more like Coca-Cola in the desert. It was a nice to have, not a must-have. So after 2 years and absolutely no revenue, it was pretty clear that we were on the wrong track. Looking back, it is quite obvious that I should have talked to those people to validate their pains, not using all my time finding co-founders, building websites and apps and designing nice screens. Lots of our assumptions would certainly be invalidated and we wouldn’t have spent so much time (and money) in it. Another reason was that our go-to-market strategy (freemium) was completely unsuitable for our target market at the time. SaaS and freemium was not a thing in Brazil 10 years ago, we would need a much more hands-on approach to sales and customer service - which would have raised our costs, thus invalidating our super cheap pricing structure. And finally, it is super hard to have part-time co-founders if you are full time. Also, they should add a ton of value and really jove with you. That was not the case, so I was constantly annoyed that things were not moving as fast as I wanted.  After 2 years of zero revenue, 2 of the co-founders had already left the company and then we decided to shut down. I was especially in dire need of money, so I just went on to search for a job - which funnily enough I got because of my work at Teamometer. "," Besides the stuff I mentioned, being the only full-time founder working on it was personally challenging. Everyone had other means of living, while I depended on the success of Teamometer. I would never do that again. Either you believe in the idea and you are in (full-time) or you are not. ",,,," Influenced by the Lean Startup book, I tried to first validate the idea. So I created the video mentioned above, put it in a simple landing page and invested a few bucks in Google Ads. The landing page offered a free trial call to action, but when the user clicked, the user was redirected to a Google Forms explaining that it was not ready, but they could leave their email to know when it was.  The ad had a very good conversion rate (maybe 20%? I don’t remember). Any sensible product manager (as I am now) would then get in contact with those people to understand their pains. That was my first crucial mistake: instead of talking to those interested people, I judged the idea validated and went searching for ways to build it. Big blunder. I reached out to a very entrepreneurial friend of mine. He then presented me to 2 other guys from his network. They were brothers and had a web development shop. We 4 decided to co-found the company literally over a cup of coffee. This was my crucial mistake #2: choosing a co-founder should be something as careful as choosing a life partner to spend your life with and have children - because if things work out, you will. But here is the deal: of us 4, I was the only one full time in the business. Also only one of us was technical. Worst still: he was an engineer, but he didn’t join to develop software, he was used to managing, not to coding. So what happened then was that we had to hire a web developer and start paying him, while the four of us didn’t add much value. Do I have to mention this was a recipe for disaster? But there is more: then we spent ONE YEAR building the app without any customer feedback. So this is what happened after this one year of development: we launched, had around 100+ free trials and ZERO sales. Oh boy...",," I envisioned and founded Teamometer as a tool to help teams to perform at a higher level. It came to me because I had experienced my fair share of bad teams and managers, while at the same time participated in a few great ones. Because I worked in leadership and talent development, I had a pretty solid base on what characteristics a high-performance team should have. It was a particularly challenging time for me because I had just moved back to Brazil after 4 years abroad and I kind of didn’t know what I should be doing. I had decided that I didn’t want to work in HR any longer because it was just too bureaucratic. At that point I was reading the Lean Startup, so starting a business seemed within reach. ‍"," Definitely validate my assumptions much more thoroughly and faster. I got the Lean Startup book completely wrong, which is understandable when you consider I had no idea about the software development world at that time. I would not spend time on BUSINESS CARDS, websites, apps, etc. I would first validate and possibly make a few sales on the promise of delivering it in the future. Then, and only then, I would use that money to build something one step at a time, always validating with those early customers. "," We were counting on inbound marketing to drive demand. We were moderately successful with that (thus the 100+ free trials). But that was a super naive strategy for the type of business we were running. Circa 2011, when this happened, SaaS was really not that much of a thing, especially in Brazil and in the B2B environment. Looking back, it was very obvious that we should have some sort of consulting style sales to help HR folks to see the value of the software. How did we get the inbound traffic? Basically by writing one article per day about stuff related to team building and development. This was force bruting SEO at its best. At the time it worked to bring the leads. Since I had a marketing and HR background and enjoyed writing, it was “easy” to research a few related keywords, look at competitors and write something better. Soon we jumped to the first top 5 spots in lots of those keywords. 2011 was also simpler days in terms of SEO professionals. Of course, this whole effort and traffic were wasted because 1) we were not able to convert free trials into paid users and 2) we were not talking to those people to understand why they were not converting. This was a very amateuristic product development mistake from my part. One thing that was insane is that we “focused” on both the Brazilian and English speaking markets, so we had 2 articles per day, one in English and one in Portuguese. This made no sense, we should have focused on our own reality (Brazil) and later expanded our reach if things worked. ‍", Here’s a post where I talk more about the story. Here’s my blog. You can also find me on Twitter and LinkedIn.," Books: The Lean Startup: For obvious reasons.

As an entrepreneur, where things go up and down a lot, it is good to have a solid grasp of reality by using numbers and facts instead of emotions. "," Two of the co-founders were the “funding” guys. So they invested about USD 3K. I invested probably around 200 USD.  Our only fixed cost was that developer we had. All the rest was bootstrapped or super cheap. We were all working remotely or in the office of another company that the other 2 founders had. Of course, there was my own time: 2 years of my life. I could add this to the cost, but to be really sincere, it was an investment. My career would not be as successful as it is today without that experience. Hell, I probably wouldn’t even be a product manager, which I found to be what I really love doing.

248,the-agent-nest," My name is Molly Wolchansky, I am currently 30 years old, and I am the founder of The Agent Nest. The Agent Nest is a SaaS that provides digital and print content to real estate agents. We have two separate monthly plans, one for $32/month and $59/month. The $32/month plan gives the agents access to all of our content, which includes social media posts with captions and hashtags, postcards, flyers, listing videos, listing templates, Instagram stories, Facebook cover photos, and more. Each piece of content has an edit link that takes them to Canva where they can customize everything to their liking. The $59/month comes with everything above, but it also includes scheduled posting, which means they can click on the schedule button under each social media post and plan out an entire month in about 15 minutes. We have white-labeled with another company, and this has allowed us to give our customers the ability to post directly from our platform to their Facebook business page, Instagram business page, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google business page.  My job duties include creating content, marketing, and customer service. I know- it’s a lot! I have hired various freelancers to help out with content creation to alleviate some stress. ",," It is always really, really fun when your entire program breaks, your entire system just decides to take a nap. Luckily, this has happened only one time. As soon as this happened, I sent out a mass email to all of my customers apologizing for the inconvenience and I let them know that we were diligently working to fix the issue. I was panicking and I started to go into one of those spiraling thought modes. I said things to myself like, “What if the program never comes back up?” “What if everyone leaves me bad reviews?” What if, what if, what if? I try not to listen to the “what-ifs” because they are not very helpful. Side note: One of my favorite writers is Shel Silverstein, and he wrote a poem about the “What-ifs” that live inside people’s heads. Highly recommend.  As far as competitors go in this industry, there are a few different platforms that offer social media posts and print marketing for real estate agents. One of the biggest obstacles we have faced as a company was trying to be different from the other companies, and my worst mistake was comparing myself too much to these other companies. A lot of times I would get down on myself and want to quit because I kept on telling myself, “I am never going to be as successful as them!” This is not a good way of thinking. I had to push more of that negative talk behind me and start focusing on what I could do to be a little bit different. In May we decided to White-label with another company, and that company made it possible for our customers to post directly onto their social media from The Agent Nest. This was a game-changer! We are the only company in this industry that offers this in the platform itself, and that is how we figured out how to be different from our competitors. We were also able to add another plan, and if someone wants to get access to that scheduling feature the cost is $59/month as opposed to the $32/month for the basic access to our site. I am so glad that we did this! One other issue I ran into was not budgeting correctly. I am the kind of person who thinks one should spend a lot of money on marketing, and we spend around $1,500/month on Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest Ads. There was a month where I was not paying attention. I usually create multiple Facebook ads at once and give them the same daily budget, and after about three days I go and see which ad is performing the best and cancel the ones that are not performing. Well… one time I forgot to do that, and I had to pay $1,000 for an ad that was not delivering and not working. That was rough! Now I pay more attention! ‍",," We are doing great today! Our growth has continued and we are getting around 75 trial sign-ups per month. If we keep on this path we will hit 10K MRR by September, which is exciting!  In the next month or so I am starting a podcast. I have gathered real estate agents that I am going to interview, and the podcast is going to focus on successful agents (and some who have not been successful). We will talk about how they became an agent, how they got their first listing, where they are today, etc. The podcast is going to have a little 10-second advertisement promoting The Agent Nest on each episode.  We are also working on having a team sign-up plan, as well as a brokerage sign-up plan. A lot of real estate agents are part of a team, so we want the team to sign up together, and we want to allow them to customize even more. For example, we are going to add a section to where they can add their team hashtags, location, etc., and these hashtags will be auto-populated at the end of each social media caption on The Agent Nest.  I also would like to start sending out a bi-weekly newsletter. I did this at the beginning, but I got too busy to keep this going.  I am hiring some people to help out with the business as soon as The Agent Nest hits 10k MRR. I would like to speak at real estate conferences and SaaS conferences and talk about how I got to where I am today. That is the ultimate goal!",," I got the idea for The Agent Nest in late October of 2019, and we launched on January 1st, 2020. I worked with my cofounder to let him know my vision for what I wanted everything to look like. We drew out each website page on sheets of paper, and we started as a no-code SaaS. After we started to grow a little bit, we decided to implement coding, and we now use Vue and C#. Since I have had previous experience with running a similar company, I found that the money to get started didn’t amount to any kind of exorbitant fee. It cost around $500 to get the business up and running. We ran into a few obstacles. For example, when someone signed up we wanted to make sure they knew how to use The Agent Nest, and the first few people who signed up were a little lost. It is pretty easy to use, but at the same time, we wanted to make sure that everyone understood all of the features we had to offer. To alleviate this situation, we created a landing page that everyone was redirected to as soon as they signed up. On this landing page, we inputted a video that I created that was a walk-through of the platform. We didn’t take much time as far as launching goes. In the past, I have attended real estate conventions, and I also had all of the information from my past clients. I had an email list of around 1,000 people, so right when we launched I sent out a mass email to them to let them know about my new product. What’s great is I knew each person individually and have met them before, so we had some signups from that group of people due to the trust I had built with them. After that initial email, it slowed down a bit, but in March it blew up due to an ad I created for Facebook. ‍",," I have always had a business-oriented mindset. When I was about five years old, my sister and I used to sit on the side of the road selling aluminum foil boats from a cooler for 25 cents each. Even at that age, I wanted to show people that our “product” worked, so I got a cooler and filled it with water, and put the boats on top of the water. If the boat didn’t float, then I would re-create a new one to make sure that it did. We did things like this often. We sold rocks that we painted, boats made from lined notebook paper (those didn’t float!), and then, of course, the aluminum foil boats. We only made about $1. I went to school and received my English degree. While I was in college, I started an Etsy business, and my target market was long-distance relationships. My best-selling product was a long-distance relationship coffee mug. I would paint states on each one, put a heart on the city, and when the mugs were held together, the dotted lines would connect to each location. During this time is when I started to love marketing, as well, and I also realized that I LOVED to be a business owner. I took some online marketing classes, and with a lot of practice, my marketing skills improved. Before shutting down the business, I made almost 2,000 sales in total over three years. I stopped my Etsy business because I had a new idea for a business- real estate marketing. My mother is a real estate agent and she needed some marketing help, so I started posting on all of her social media outlets with content I created through Canva. Many of her friends reached out to her and asked her where she was getting her content from. A lightbulb went off in my head! I contacted each person, set up a monthly plan for them, which was around $450/month, and then I opened up a company called MoRealty Marketing. I would post on my client’s social media every single day, manage comments and followers, create print materials for them, and more. I did this for six years. It was a lot of work for one person to handle. Then, after a while, I started to create open house promos, flyers, videos- people started reaching out to me to create postcards, business cards, and logos. Keller Williams reached out to me to start teaching marketing classes at some of their branches, so I would travel around the Dallas metroplex and teach in front of a big group of agents. There were a lot of positives here, but here is my biggest mistake: I would say “yes” to everyone, and I started to feel overwhelmed. There were only so many people I could take on at once.  I got my idea for The Agent Nest in October of 2019. I wanted to create a program where it would essentially run itself, and a program that allowed an infinite amount of members. Another of the main issues I ran into with Morealty Marketing was that people couldn’t afford the $450/month, so I also wanted to create a company that was more affordable for the average real estate agent, as well. Luckily, my boyfriend is a programmer and also runs his own SaaS, so we had many late-night chats and brainstorming sessions about what we could do to solve these problems: How can I take on more clients?How can I make it affordable?How can I be less overwhelmed?  Once we were able to answer these questions, The Agent Nest was born."," Stop the negative self-talk: I would not have gotten to where I am today if I had just quit whenever those not-good-enough thoughts were planted into my brain. Respond to customers as soon as possible: I would see an e-mail from a customer and think, “I’ll get back to them after I do this!” And then sometimes I forgot to get back to them. In a business, the customer’s happiness should come first.It’s okay if I don’t meet my goals: As you can tell, I am a bit of a perfectionist, so I always want to meet all goals I have set. In the past, if I didn’t meet a goal, I went back to thinking I should give up. Now, if I don’t hit the MRR I wanted to hit for a month, I sit back and reevaluate what I could have done differently, and then I  investigate why one month was different from the last.Post every single day on social media: To build trust, and to target clients, the best thing to do is to post on social media every single day, even if it’s something as simple as “Here’s my morning coffee!” I also started posting photos of myself at the office, photos of my clients, and I even started an “Agent of the Week” series that everyone loves. ‍"," To start the business, I decided to offer a two-week free trial to members so they could get a feel of the program, and also because people tend to love free trials! During the two-week free trial, the customer would receive automated emails on how to grow their real estate business, how to create business pages, how to target their chosen audience, I would often and more. We wanted people to feel like they were getting value in addition to getting content. The Agent Nest received its first trial on January 6th of 2020, and I was so excited! It was a former client of mine from Morealty Marketing. By the end of January, I had 7 paying customers, and my MRR was $145. In February I started posting on my Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest more often, I created a real estate Facebook group that pertained to social media, and I started running my first ads through Facebook and Google. I didn’t have that big of a marketing budget during this time, so, of course, I was spending more than I was making, which is OKAY. By the end of February, I had 17 members total, and my MRR was $430. I was so excited that I almost tripled my MRR from the previous month, but, at the same time, I tend to be hard on myself. I have always been the kind of person who wants everything to be perfect who wants to be THE BEST. Can you believe after two months I was already putting THIS much pressure on myself? Sometimes it hindered me more than it helped, but it did make me more determined. In March of 2020, I continued my marketing strategies from February since it seemed to work, but also during this time I changed the 14 days free trial to a 30-day free trial. I then created a Facebook ad for this promotion with a $400 budget for the month. The Facebook ad was successful. By the end of March, I had 122 30-day trial sign-ups, and my MRR was $517. Then, in April, my MRR shot up to $2,443, and I had a 65% trial conversion rate. To continue the growth of The Agent Nest, I began running ads on my Pinterest after I created different boards about real estate marketing with my content on there. I still pay around $75/month for Pinterest ads and average 90,000 page views per month. I have also hosted real estate webinars on a wide range of topics and advertise them on Facebook Groups, pages, and ads. In August of 2020, I got invited to be interviewed on the Podcast “Getting your Real Estate Life Together” and had a blast. I’m always open for more Podcast interviews! ‍"," Here are a few places you can go to learn more about my business: Website, Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest."," We use ConvertKit for all of our e-mail automation.

249,the-blogging-manifesto," Thanks for interviewing me! I am a pro blogger who created and runs Blogging From Paradise. Former fired security guard turned island hopping, Amazon best selling, pro blogger here. I help folks retire to a life of island hopping through smart blogging. But it wasn't always that way. 3 years ago when I wanted to find my footing financially I hatched a blog and eBook named The Blogging Manifesto. That didn't exactly pan out as I had planned but I did learn a few invaluable lessons from the venture.  "," The problem? Selling 4 eBooks in 4 months was a start. I understand that the good things take time but sometimes seeing business-based results coming up way short gives you a reality check. Selling 1 eBook per month woke me up to the real problem: I had no real passion for this business. I was working the blog and promoting my eBook almost predominantly to make money. I actually created and promoted the eBook before publishing my first blog post, which was a major red flag.  "," I made many mistakes: I started this blog without having a deep passion for blogging (at that time).I started the business mainly to make money versus mainly wanting to render helpful service to solve a pressing problem.I heavily attached myself to blog traffic and revenue outcomes instead of focusing on giving I obsessed with getting, which is a business killer.I had no sound plan for following a posting schedule.I released the eBook on an unknown platform versus self-publishing on Amazon I could go on for the next hour. But I have a thriving business to attend LOL!                                                                                                                                                   ",,," My only real disadvantage was not doing this for passionate, loving, fun purposes. Because 3 months after I launched and failed with this blog and eBook I launched Blogging From Paradise. Since I started BFP mainly to have fun and to follow my passion I had success with the blog quickly and wrote a few best sellers on Amazon. Why? When you begin a business or startup predominantly to follow your passion and to render useful service, you knife through all the obstacles that folks with less pure intentions slam into. I figured out how to write, self-publish and promote eBooks just 3 months after I had no clue in Hades how to do so with The Blogging Manifesto. I stuck a strict posting schedule. I networked effectively. My competition dissolved into prospering friendships. All because I was blogging mainly to have fun. Thriving businesses are rooted in this fun, playful energy, and struggling businesses are rooted in a strained, fearful, greedy energy.",," I promoted the blog and eBook through Twitter, Facebook, G Plus, Triberr, and YouTube. At its core, this was a sound marketing strategy. I generated over 1000 page visits a day by aggressively sharing this blog in the right spots and by commenting on top blogs and linking into the blog. I did see steady progress in the traffic department. Brand awareness slowly expanded. But I had a few fundamental problems with the blog, my eBook, the entire business model and my prime motivator for building the blog."," I designed The Blogging Manifesto to complement my former primary blog. I wanted to help my readers with their blogging problems by creating both an eBook and blog to give struggling bloggers a 1-2 punch to work with. The first steps included buying my domain and hosting, spotting a pressing blogging problem and crafting my eBook, blog and subsequent income streams (which I hadn't really thought through) based on this pressing problem. I would publish a video post or article daily to address common blogging issues then I would link to my eBook via a strong call to action. So I dove into writing the eBook, finished it, had my web designer craft a cover and we went life quickly.  "," Create Blogging From Paradise :) And do it from a place of passion. This is a classic example of starting over, with a clean slate, for the right reasons, intelligently, not 3 months after a failed startup. I have been featured on Richard Branson's blog, Forbes, Entrepreneur and Fox News since I hatched Blogging From Paradise because I did a complete 180 from my Blogging Manifesto days. I picked an authentic, easy to visualize domain name. I monetized my blog from day 1 but 99% of my energies were spent solving problems for free through my blog. I guest posted and blog commented effectively. I went on to write 126 bite-sized eBooks under the BFP brand name and became obsessed with branding, ensuring that everything on my blog bled my brand.    Start a business, a blog or begin a startup almost entirely for the love or passion of following your fun.

250,the-careside," I am the CEO and co-founder of The CareSide. We provide home care and nursing services to seniors. We’re headquartered in Perth, Australia. That’s where I live.  Our clients are typically individuals who are responsible for taking care of an elderly family member or friend. They need help with the demands of caregiving, which can be a huge burden. That’s where we come in. We offer a variety of healthcare services such as live-in, companion, and respite care. Our goal is to provide the best value care. As a lean startup, we are able to keep our costs low and pass those savings onto our customers. My responsibilities have changed. Initially, I was involved in all areas of the business. However, as the company has grown, that has changed and I’ve had to get better at delegating work. The advantage of being involved in the different aspects of the company early on is I learned what skills were required for different jobs. This has made hiring much easier because I know what to look for when interviewing vendors or employees. ‍",," The main hurdle we faced in the early days was ensuring we had the proper paperwork. Our industry is heavily regulated. We were audited seven different times by different government agencies. That’s probably a good thing for consumers, but can be frustrating for business owners. It was a very bureaucratic process. We overcame this challenge by hiring a consultant who helped us apply for the required licenses.  We believe in value. People love great value for money. Better services are hard to quantify and hard to justify. People always expect a good result from your services. Our experience is that people expect to pay for baseline acceptability. Anything above this they do not want to pay for. They would rather spend their money on something else. So I always design service delivery to execute with optimum value. Charging extra money for a premium service is quite hard to justify. It took us a while to realize this. I think that has been one of our biggest mistakes so far. But now we have our pricing strategy and USPs optimized. ",," We’re fortunate that the coronavirus pandemic has been so well controlled in Australia. The economy here has not been impacted as much as it has in other countries.  We are currently growing revenue by 16% per month and profit by 9% per month. Our profit margins are over 20%.  By the end of this year, we hope to be turning over $10M in revenue. We will need to hire another 2 managers and another 30 employees to support this growth. Currently, the team consists of three managers, two administrative assistants, two accountants, one bookkeeper, and over one hundred carers.  We’re growing the company two ways. One, we’re expanding geographically by opening offices in new states. For example, we just opened our first office outside of Perth in Adelaide. It’s a coastal city in the southern part of the country. We hope to expand into additional two more states this year as well. The second way we’re growing is by offering new services. We recently qualified to offer disability services. From an operational perspective, it’s very similar to home care. However, it’s completely different from a legal perspective. It’s regulated by a different government body. We’re excited to roll out disability services soon.  We have spent the past couple of years reinvesting some of our profits back into the business. We’ve used this money to develop our own CRM software. There are very few software solutions for our industry. Our software helps with sales, payroll, and HR. In the future, we would like to sell this to other companies.  ‍",," The advantage of starting a service company is we didn’t have to invest a lot upfront or raise money from investors in order to develop a software or hardware product. Our product is our human capital.  Our pricing strategy is simple: we want to provide the best value. All of our competitors charge as much as we do. That’s because the Australian government sets the pricing of the healthcare program we provide, which are called home care packages. In other words, each home care package level includes a set amount of government funding. However, the services that are included by each home care provider can vary greatly. We offer more hours of service for the same care. So while the cost is technically the same on paper, the value we provide is much greater.  ",," Oddly enough, my background is in management consulting and data analysis. Prior to launching The CareSide, I helped organizations develop enterprise software solutions. I worked for multinational companies in Australia such as ANZ, KPMG, and Western Power. However, I’ve always wanted to start my own business. My wife and business partner is a registered nurse and also has an MBA. Her background as a healthcare worker is one of the reasons we decided to start our own company. We wanted to combine my business background with her industry expertise.  We saw the Australian home care industry was going through large regulatory changes a few years ago. Opportunities were opening up and we wanted to start our own venture. Since we have children, the challenge was giving up the stability of our full-time jobs. It was a risk. But one we’re glad we took. ‍ "," I have learned that you get what you focus on. Whatever area of the business you invest your time and energy in will tend to do well. If you put energy into marketing, you get more leads. If you put your energy into process improvement, you get more efficient operations. Whatever you do not focus on will slowly fall apart. Each area of the business is like a garden. It needs constant attention. Without it, problems grow and become more urgent until you are overwhelmed by them. We are big believers in building our own software. This gives you complete control over your operations. You can make the software reflect how you want to do things, and this can be a huge differentiator from your competitors. Your operations are largely determined by your software systems, and those businesses that use standard software are doomed to all have the same operating processes which will lead to the same cost model.   ‍"," We tried different strategies to get the word out. Most of the things we did initially weren’t successful. For example, we ran ads in newspapers. But eventually, we learned that people aren’t looking for home care when they read the news. Then we tried direct sales by leaving business cards on the doorsteps of seniors. But our messaging was off.  Eventually, we shifted our marketing efforts to our web presence and digital marketing. And it’s worked. We realized that our business isn’t something that you buy while browsing around or because you happen to land on an advertisement by chance. Instead, it’s like a plumber’s. You need it when you need it. Outside of that time period, you’re not looking for it.  Our primary drivers of growth now are PPC, content marketing, and social media. We got traction right away with Google Ads. It took about 6 months to start to see some results from SEO and inbound marketing.   ‍"," We frequently publish content on our blog about different aspects of caregiving. One of our most popular articles is a post we wrote about home care package programs, which help seniors in Australia afford home care services. I’m also on LinkedIn. ‍"," Although we have developed our own software suite, we still utilize other tools. There are three that I recommend. For internal and external communications, we use the Google Suite (e.g. Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, etc.). We also use Xero for our accounting. It helps make sure that we have a single source of truth if we get audited. Finally, we’ve had success with CanIRank’s SEO tool to manage our inbound marketing. The nice thing about CanIRank is it provides marketing recommendations, not just data.  The books that have had the biggest impact on my career are the Four Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss and E-Myth Mastery by Michael Gerber. The former gave me the courage to leave my full-time job. The latter helped me hone my skills in leadership and management. I also listen to the Y Combinator lecture series by Sam Altman. It’s great for startup advice.

251,the-nerd-cave," Heya! My name is Dave Desi, one of the founding partners of The Nerd Cave in Sydney, Australia. Longtime retail manager and 2-time business owner. ‍"," Much like any failure, I don’t personally think it was due to any one singular reason. Through the Cave’s lifetime, we moved 3 times. Our first move was based on a lack of space within our store. We had people sitting on the floor and we were turning customers away at the door. It was obvious that we had outgrown our first tiny location. The 2nd location was the longest-term location and it proved to be our best. It was, however, within a fairly decent proximity to 2 other game/hobby stores (both franchises of the same company) which caused many issues for us. Our retail sales dropped off after this move and we had to adapt a larger portion of the store towards a wider variety of retail items to be able to compete with them. Our 3rd location was a move we weren’t all that excited about. The 2nd location’s building was slated to be knocked down and the owners refused to settle a new lease agreement with us, leaving us on a month by month lease with an axe dangling above our necks. It took us 8 months to find the 3rd location, mainly due to the constraints on location and size. In our 3rd location, our demographic shifted. We were further away from the universities, meaning we lost a little bit of the 20-30 age bracket. This caused a shift on what was selling well for us and generally less income. We closed our doors after being in the new location for only 5 months. I believe during our time of operation, board gaming and gaming clubs evolved around us to be similar to what we were trying to do but distanced enough away from a normal gaming store to stand out. A lot of “gaming bars” have come about in the last few years (we never sold alcohol) and many other locations offering table space for board games. The market became more diluted than when we started and I am not sure we did enough to set ourselves apart.  Near the end of the business, I spoke with a few other store owners about our situation and someone said something that struck me as quite prolific when people start a business, we all think that the “thing” that will set us apart is “us”. We all say, “Well I will treat my customers well and always have time for them”. The problem with this mentality and thought process is that we aren’t selling ourselves. Your customers don’t know you are a nice guy until they have already become a customer. So, find the “thing” that makes your location unique. ‍"," We started with a very low capital ($75,000AUD). This meant that our start was slow and we really had to prove ourselves in the early portion of the Cave’s existence. Another challenge we had was defining ourselves. We had a little of everything, which meant some people were confused as to what we were actually doing. This was generally overcome once they stepped through the door and experienced it for themselves, but we definitely should have had a stronger identity to really breakthrough.",,,," I initially started by finding some business partners. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to get the loans out I needed by myself. After we gathered and all worked out our individual loans, we pooled our money and began building.  We did everything on an EXTREMELY tight budget. This meant fine tooth combing almost every aspect and finding the most affordable means of achieving every goal (this became known as doing it “Cave style” between us). That’s not to say the equipment we purchased was bad, but it was always on a budget. We were worried about stepping really deep into it without being able to 100% ensure our methods would work. We built each of the 10 PC’s by hand, ordering parts from the cheapest locations we could find. Those PC’s lasted the full 4 years of operation.  Through our time being open, our focus was always smaller upgrades as we felt comfortable. When we had more people using our board game tables than we used to be able to seat, we upgraded our tables and seating to be more functional and space efficient. When certain games weren’t playing or selling as well, we moved them on as quickly as possible to maximize retail space for only current best-selling items (where possible).  When we found the first location to be overly full and capped out with customers, we moved to a new location. We only made changes once it was past the tipping point. This kept our setup constantly changing and flowing with what worked. Initially, the business plan was a gym membership style model, but this quickly changed as we heard from our original (and small) community that they would only be willing to pay for use of the electronic items, rather than the “analogue” stuff like board games.",," The Nerd Cave was supposed to be a new kind of retail model. One that blends community centers, retail and hobby store all into one place. Our focus was on building a truly safe space for gamers of all kinds to come and enjoy their passion and hobby, without the pressure that is generally present in a standard retail store.  The idea was rattling around in my head for many years, but (believe it or not) the idea actually comes from the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle live action film. There is a scene where April O’Niell’s editor’s kid heads to the foot clans city hideout. When he arrives, he is greeted into a massive space where kids are playing arcade games, gambling, skateboarding and more. My plan was to make that place a reality, minus the gambling, drinking, and smoking… and foot clan.  Our plan was to approach it slowly and build the play space rather than being purely focused on retail. We were always working with key people in the community to facilitate events and make The Cave the most desirable location to run games/events.  "," This is a tricky one. Me and the other partners have had lots of thoughts on this one, but if I’m being honest I am not sure I want to share them! Keep your eyes peeled in the future. What I can say is that having a strong identity and selling point would be key. ‍  Apart from general retail management, I learned skills that I am not sure they have come from any other experience. Negotiation, interpersonal skills, economic, the list goes on and on.  The most valuable lessons are the ones you learn through experience and running a store gives you plenty.  "," Our strategy was simple. Approach the existing gaming clubs, find out their needs and fill them. Offer the local ones a new location to run their meetups and events. Once we had that ball rolling there, we moved onto more consistent social media advertising which always worked for us. Our biggest generator (as for most business’) was word of mouth. We made sure to always have time for our customers, this really helped with word of mouth as we became the store that had staff that was interested in interacting with people. We utilized multiple different websites to advertise events, local “things to do” guides and websites like Eventbrite. We didn’t always sell tickets online, but it always generated traffic. ‍", The only living vestige is Facebook! Feel free to drop us a line there and we will always try to answer as best we can.," The only thing I ever looked at in regards to business was /r/Entrepreneur. Me and my partners have never been a “by the book” group of people, so it never made sense to us to follow old practices. We did, however, seek advice from other store owners in similar industries, in an attempt to widen our knowledge pool where necessary.   "," As stated above, we had an initial capital of $75,000AUD. We took on one additional partner in our second year to help with moving and equipment costs which added $25,000AUD to the initial investment.  I am quite happy to say that we all only have a very minimal debt after the 4 years of operation, with the majority of it being rental debt based on exiting our lease early. ‍",Entertainment,Lack of Funds,Australia,"March 17, 2018",David Desi,https://www.failory.com/interview/the-nerd-cave,['http://facebook.com/the.nerd.cave.au'],failure,0,,"The Nerd Cave was a new kind of retail model, a truly safe space for gamers of all kinds to go and enjoy their passion and hobby.

252,the-punjab-kitchen," I’m a hard-core sales professional and, although I have never worked in the food & beverage sector, I was able to utilize my skills from healthcare in building a new F&B brand.  At the back of my mind was the assumption that if the fundamentals were correct, then the industry didn’t make a difference. The main idea came into place mainly because my wife is a fantastic cooker, and she was constantly receiving numerous feedbacks from family and friends who had tasted her cooking, telling her she should try to commercialize her passion. We started brainstorming a few ideas. But we could easily identify a gap in the regular homemade food market, which most of the migrants living in our city (Gurgaon) were missing the most. It is perhaps impertinent to inform you that North Indians usually consume homemade meals including bread, lentils, vegetables, chicken, and meat. So, after a few weeks, we started The Punjab Kitchen. As the name says, we were specializing in the cuisine from the state of Punjab, which the majority of the people in Delhi NCR are familiar with. The business model initially was B2C with the intention of pitching to corporates (B2B) in the later stage. We wanted to cater to direct consumers who wanted to buy homemade measl, so our tagline was: “homemade food that fits your lifestyle”. ‍"," Price was our biggest barrier to dominate the market. The competition was available at half of the price. We didn’t have a much better product. And the packaging was good, but the customer perhaps didn’t care too much about it. We wanted to get some benefits from the economies of scale, but we couldn’t scale up instantaneously to drive the pricing down. The signs were clear within the first year. The numbers were not growing the way we thought they should and the monthly payouts started to hurt us. We tried several attempts to get a breakthrough on B2B. We tried to become vendors to corporates which bought the food for their employees but here we found that established restaurants were already hooked on. It was indeed a sad moment to close as the plan was to grow internationally. But then, we couldn’t continue to bleed. The resources were minimal and after the first 12 months, we hadn’t even achieved break even. ‍"," The major challenge was to create acceptability for our product at the price point. We could have overcome this challenge if we had the financial capability to run a campaign to educate the customer about the differentiated product. The market is really price elastic, especially for the kind of cuisine we were offering. We could not have been successful at the price point at which we were playing without making some kind of changes either by on products, packaging or elsewhere in the value chain.",,,," Once we have decided that we were getting on this new project, I carried out a market research and found that it was completely fragmented between a few big organized players.  Anyway, we went ahead with the idea and created an online menu and got into contact with a few professionals from the F&B sector. One thing that was tricky to carry out was the design of a good packaging. It took me a lot of time to sort with multiple vendors. We also designed some assets to promote our business, such as flyers, posters, banners and stands. With the positive feedback on the sample tasting and menu, we were clearly ready to go. You can check our website here, and our marketing efforts on this Zomato article and this Facebook Page. This whole process took us 3 months of intense preparation. This included the following steps: Incorporation of the company.Hiring a creative freelancer for branding.IT outsourcing for the website.Photo-shooting of food.Menu finalization.Building marketing assets (packaging, brochures, carry bags, posters, banner standees).Outsourcing delivery and cook. We hired one for each.Preparing a dress code for the delivery boy.Negotiation with food platforms such as Zomato and Swiggy. Both websites are discovery platforms which help the customer find and order food from thousands of food shops.Shortlisting influencer marketing partners for social media. ‍ The whole process listed above lead us to the launch stage, which was clearly the fun part. The real challenges surfaced only afterward. The pricing of our food was the biggest puzzle to solve. We were clearly not close to the market benchmark, the current price consumers were paying to get a meal, which was around 1$ (70 RS). Our competitors were selling the meals much lower than we. The only 2 ways we could solve this big problem was by achieving economies of scale, which meant to have thousands of customers so that our costs of producing a meal reduced, or to re-use the packaging of the delivered food. Both of them were not possible options. After working out a basic profit margin, we decided to price our product at $2.5 (150 RS) the vegetarian meals and $3.5 (200 RS) the non-vegetarian meals.",," Our motivation was to cover a missing solution in the market. Considering the gap, we identified, we had little doubts that we would face any difficulty (first error!). As my wife shared the real passion for the sector, she was in charge of the main operations of the whole business. Instead, I was the marketer and the logistics in charge (which was the backbone of the whole business). Prior to TPK, I had held numerous positions within the corporate sector either as head of sales, marketing, or business development. But in either consumer or healthcare sectors, I did not ever have anything to do with F&B. I had little clue on what kind of challenges we would be facing there. ‍"," To be honest, I would only jump into the game again if I had enough financial resources to start big and cover the expenses. Although I had several thoughts at the time of closing that we might have succeeded in the B2B model, I now really doubt about that. Where I would now spend much less time and money is on branding exercise (we changed logo twice). Perhaps this was not given much weight by our customers. ‍"," Publicity was another challenge as we had wasted much of our resources. We were only hoping to get traction either via newspaper inserts or Zomato AD inserts. Additionally, we created some banner stands for placements on corporates who had started taking our products. These are some of the marketing strategies we carried out: Mass emailing: It obviously didn’t work.Newspaper inserts: They didn’t work.Our AD on Zomato brought some customers, but the ROI was not justified. We ran lots of campaigns making permutations and combinations with various categories under the Zomato platform for a year, but the results were still not justifying the costs.Facebook Ads didn’t work. We did get likes but they did not convert into customers. Within the first year, we reached 9K likes on our page.We invested the most on food bloggers by sampling them free food to ask for genuine reviews and ratings on Zomato platform. This definitely worked for us in spreading the word around. Within the first year, we had reached 4.3 rating out of 5 on Zomato. ‍"," If you want, go and visit my LinkedIn profile."," I read about other entrepreneurs on various platforms, such as LinkedIn, YourStory, VCCircle and Tie. ‍"," We could not break-even after running for almost 18 months of the venture. Our expenses were more than revenues in short. At the time of closure, we had only got $800 (50K RS) in revenue while we were burning $1,200 (75K RS) every month which included salaries of 2 full-time employees, marketing cost and other expenses.

I could build such a thing in like half an hour, but when you’re depressed, it just doesn’t work. You can see the different letters of code on your screen but you can’t read it, you just don’t understand what’s going on in the code you just wrote. Examples on GitHub don’t help either as you are unable to comprehend them. Receiving every new block from a designer was a nightmare. No matter if it was actually great or not, voices in my head were already shaming me as if my product was already released and failed miserably. I was seeing nightmares about tens of thousands of downvotes on my release page with comments that shamed me. I was seeing that I came to the job interview later and they just laughed at me for my failed product. The power of will can do nothing with depression. It’s caused by a chemical imbalance inside your brain, so there’s no thought process you can establish to escape such a state. Existing medical treatment strategies weren't effective enough in my case, so I’m still on my therapy.  As I was unable to complete the product, I decided that it’s better to write a story about it and end it all rather than to continue the fight I couldn’t win. Several of my friends also have depression and are trying to build their products so at least my story could be useful. As I published the story, I felt relieved. This was a great experience and I have no regrets."," It’s hard to think of mistakes of a product that was never launched and was shut down at the early stage of development. As I’ve never monetized my products before, I think my main marketing mistakes were ahead, never actually destined to happen. The main challenge was making my product not generic, a point where it would be impossible to compete with other mature products that had more functionalities because of the years spent building them, better marketing budgets, and experts.  I think my main mistake was realizing that I was unable to continue but still deciding to proceed. It cost me two years but as I have a habit of celebrating my mistakes and turning them into advantages, I learned a lot and it all made a great story. ‍",,,," Initially, Thepresence description called Project Orca was written in 2018 and featured much more than just the website builder – there was the blog module, the e-shop functionality, and even the opt-out hub where all the published content of all Orca-powered websites should’ve been displayed. I saw that YCombinator was accepting ideas and I decided to submit mine. Either because I had no previous experience with how to make your submission attractive or the initial idea wasn’t good enough, my submission was canceled. I wasn’t worried about that because I was submitting it as an experiment, just to see what happened. I decided to build it myself then. I read The Lean Startup and decide that it was better to strip the idea down but actually ship it than eventually face the fact that I alone couldn’t build such a complex product. So I reduce the functionalities to just the static website builder with blocks that allowed publishing the website with a custom domain name. Later on, I decided to reduce it even further to just the HTML exporting. All the products I’ve launched were built by just me, so I decided to design everything myself. I took the design courses by Calarts and got some practice designing sample mockups. Later, as I was browsing Awwwards for design ideas for the blocks, I realized that I only had the experience to copy them at best, but not to fuse the ideas I was seeing into universal blocks that could be put together in arbitrary order and still work as a website. Maybe this time I should hire someone. I have a friend who is a great graphic designer and he also prefers modernist design language. I saw a fit and hired him. I had the experience of working as a team leader, so I knew how to manage the process to make the whole experience not frustrating for the designer. At this time both my depression and a so-called treatment with neuroleptics made the further work process impossible. I abandoned this project and quit my actual job.",," I saw the Launchpad iOS app that allows people to create music. As I tried it, I saw an interesting pattern – even if I close my eyes and just tap the tiles in the app randomly, a pretty listenable music was coming out. I love and collect great graphic design examples and websites, but I always thought that you need to be talented to create a website that would be this good. But what if I could design great, modern website blocks and allow people to create websites with them, just like what Launchpad app does with pre-recorded samples? No matter if you are talented or not, just a random sequence of such blocks would come out as a modern website with a striking design. I saw the success of Designmodo as they did the same thing, but I wanted to do this differently. Instead of focusing on conventional design trends that would appeal to the general public, I wanted to focus on freelancers and design geeks who seem to prefer a more modern, unconventional, experimental design. This is already a huge trend in the graphic design community led by freelancers you can see on Awwwards and Instagram. Experimental typefaces, glittery 3D-models, visual glitches, and overall modernism – right there, at your fingertips. Thepresence should’ve been just that, allowing you to build a website just like those which you saw and liked but never knew how to design. ‍"," Of course, I wouldn’t submit it to YCombinator. I wouldn’t start over with a complex idea and eventually reduce it. The only thing I achieved building Thepresence is probably a finished simple idea of what this product should be. With that idea, if I heal completely and want to do it all again, I would do just the same thing. I still see Thepresence as a great product. If someone builds it before I do, I still would’ve used it. ‍"," I was working with Alexander Isora who made The Unicorn Platform and successfully maintains it as his main job. He shared some useful insights and connections to help my product gain the initial momentum when it launched. He was the one who taught me how to launch properly. I used what I learned from his tactics and it worked perfectly with what I built before. I was aware that Thepresence is a niche product and shouldn’t be targeted to the general audience. I wasn’t trying to change the whole industry, I just wanted to build the first project that I could monetize. You can’t truly focus when you’re trying to satisfy everyone. So instead of doing that, I decided to focus on a small but loyal auditory and its needs. I wasn’t looking to build a Squarespace killer but a product that my auditory wanted to stay with. I wanted it to be shared among their friends as an insight, a tool that isn’t for everyone. For the pricing, I decided to pick a market average value of $28 a month. Not so cheap that it doesn’t feel premium but not so expensive that it raises expectations that the product is unable to meet. ‍", You can read the full story on thepresence.io.," The Code Complete is a book that allowed me to code fast and create a code that would do the job. I think it’s important to not get caught in an unproductive process of rethinking the code over and over with the sole purpose of using the bleeding-edge technology.

254,toki," Hi! My name Vladimir and I’m currently living in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Toki was a one-stop solution to find trends and analytics on TikTok. I started working on it almost a year ago and it was my side-project. The main idea was to create a SaaS platform where marketers could get insights on “mined” data from TikTok. The business model was the typical SaaS subscription with a free trial, plus different tiers showing various levels of data, reports, and other features. "," We didn’t follow one of the most important rules: “Get paid customers before the first line of code, before investing hours and hours on the product.” Despite the lack of revenue, we worked hard and the project looked promising until the week after the PH launch. I was waiting to better understand the project direction based on relevant feedback. ‍  We made a few mistakes. The first one was that founders should have a fit with the idea, feel an obsession to create a company that solves the user’s problem in a concrete niche. Founders need to feel a deep connection with the idea and the problem they are tackling to be productive and positive even in hard times. Otherwise, founders give up in a few months when things are not going as expected. I had curiosity in that market but looks like it wasn’t enough to keep me motivated.",,,,," First of all, I planned to build the tool as quickly as possible. I gave myself two weeks for research and one month for development. Also, I started to think about finding a co-founder. Remembered a good friend, Alex, who probably would be interested in the idea. I pitched him my vision and we became a team of two. We started talking with few known marketers who work regularly with influencers and got insights about their pains and the daily time wasted trying to measure the success of their campaigns. Then I started to code the product. Alex created an awesome landing page and we did calls every couple of days about new features, priorities, and pivoting options. In the beginning, the hardest part was the UI. Another issue was getting data from TikTok. They don’t have an official API and almost all tools and libraries found on Github were unstable. But we found a way to automatically get the data from what was displayed in the app. Two months later, we went live."," It was the hardest part because of our lack of marketing experience. We planned to get the first paid users from friends and cold emailing. Our second step was to launch on Product Hunt and then scale. It looks naive, but it was our plan. We started with cold direct messaging on Facebook and commenting in marketing groups. We had interviews with marketers with crazy optimistic feedback. We got some signups. None of them was a paying user, but we started getting feedback from real users.  One month later, we decided to launch Product Hunt. We ended the day in the 6th position. We got some traffic, feedback, and messages like “Toki is awesome!”. However, Product Hunt will not do magic for your project. Our launch translated into thousands of visits, a few dozen free users, and zero paid users. ‍"," I’m a tech guy, with more than 10 years in the web and mobile development industry. I mostly worked in backend engineering, architecture, and technical leading areas. A few years ago, after failing with a game development company, I gathered interest in analytics and data-driving decisions. The reason was that the biggest mistake we made in building the game development business was a lack of experience in game analytics. A few months ago, right after the whole world had been locked in their apartments, I decided to spend some time on new ideas. A question was resonating in my head: ""How do marketers search for trends and measure their success on TikTok?"".

255,toygaroo," I started out as a musician but after deciding I also like to have food on the table, I got into writing software in the early 90s (yes, I am old). I wrote traditional software - Macintosh applications - in the beginning, but starting in 1996 I got into the fledgling internet. Since then I've worked in Canada (my homeland), US, and across Europe starting in 1997 (writing software is a much better way to see the world than joining the military, in my opinion). I always was a consultant and started lots of companies. Back in the early 2000s, I co-founded a company that wrote gambling games for mobiles (WAP - remember that?!). Other companies included Filmamora, a DVD rental by mail company, in Spain. A kind of Netflix for Spain. That led to my contact with Team Toygaroo. Right now, I am living in Japan and I own and run two large websites - the first is Zonmaster, an after-sales support service site for Amazon sellers. We provide auto-responders, financial views and the like. The other is LotteryCanada, a site I’ve been running for 20 years. Oh god!  "," There are differing views here, I’m sure. I can only give my opinion and recollection. Toygaroo was doing well and we were always getting more customers. The issue was getting control of two things - inventory costs and logistical costs. We had hoped that O’Leary would be able to introduce us to people in the toy business, given his past with Mattel. If that ever happened I didn’t hear about it, and certainly, we never saw any purchasing benefit. Maybe he tried and failed, I don’t quite remember. So, we had a pretty high cost for the toys. We were even going to the local Walmarts and ToysRUs to get toys as they were selling retail cheaper than we could get wholesale. That in and of itself is not a bad business model for a startup, but, because of our new partners we were under close scrutiny and high pressure to “grow grow grow”. We had little to no interaction with Cuban himself, but he did assign an assistant to monitor us. They claimed that the Toygaroo team was infighting, but the truth is we were battling with them. We knew that the model was wrong - we offered free shipping and because toys were so variable in shape and size that was the wrong thing to do. My recollection is that we wanted to move away from the ‘free shipping’ model but Cuban’s team was adamant that was a USP for us and also ‘part of what they signed up for’. So costs spiraled. I honestly think that had we been able to source more cheaply and change the shipping model we would have kept going. When it became apparent that the finances were sinking us, and that we weren’t able to fix these two key issues of sourcing and shipping, we approached Cuban (and perhaps O’Leary) for another cash injection, which they declined to do. Funnily enough though, once we were really down to the last dollars, they did offer to ‘take Toygaroo off our hands’ for essentially nothing. I don’t know what reasoning they had for offering to take a sinking ship. I can guess. I don’t think - knowing those guys - that it was charity. We decided to close down the company as we were majority shareholders. All of us had other opportunities, and all of us had run other companies. So we knew sometimes you just have to move on.",,,,," We had the Filmamora codebase and I had a lot of experience in the concepts as I’d been running Filmamora for a few years by this point. We had a small warehouse in the Los Angeles area that we ran all the logistics from. We had a very spiffy toy cleaning device. Toy cleaning was the #1 concern of our customers. (top tip: listen to your customers! it’s not about you, it’s about them.)  ",," Toygaroo was an exciting twist on the “rental” phenomenon - we called ourselves the Netflix of toys. People would sign up for a “toy box” subscription and pick how many toys - 2, 3, 5, whatever the subscription level was. They could have x number of toys out at a time. If they returned one we’d send a new toy from their list. That way there could be a near constant stream of toys coming into the house. And if the kids really loved a toy they could buy from us. The company was founded by a great group of people based in Los Angeles. They had good marketing experience, but needed the software. I came in, licensing the Filmamora software to them and modifying it as needed - which essentially turned into a re-write of the code. ‍"," Not go on SharkTank, just build organically. Always have a handle on the key components of your business. We just didn’t. We were at the mercy of pricing. I’m sure the shipping issue could have been overcome, I’ve since done it in other ventures. But sourcing toys...that’s tough. ‍"," We never really had an issue with attracting customers or press. We were on national TV shows (including GMA, if I remember correctly) before the SharkTank appearance even. I think that everyone could see the idea had potential. Really it was a matter of contacting the right people - once they heard the idea they were on board. I am not the marketing guy, so I can’t really get into the nuts and bolts of that side of it."," If for some insane reason you want to listen to any more of what I have to say you can find me on YouTube or my website. I tweet on occasion at @psmy, but mostly about how I am getting shafted by Air Canada all the time. If you sell Private Label on Amazon I can’t imagine why you wouldn’t be a Zonmaster customer already, but if you’re not, head over there."," Entrpreneurism isn’t rocket science (unless you’re Elon Musk of course!). People spend so much time listening to podcasts and all of that, when there are some very simple truths. Come up with an idea, research it, work on it, see what other people think, don’t spend money on it unless you absolutely positively have to, don’t get investors until AFTER you are making a profit, provide great customer service. For business books, I loved the Sam Walton autobiography. I love Peter Drucker. Books that are more about social phenomenon - like Jonah Berger’s Contagious, Bold by Peter Diamandis, or Ryan Holliday’s The Obstacle is the Way - are also awesome. It is about a mindset. Create something, make it as good as it can possibly be. Don’t accept mediocrity.  ‍"," The SharkTank money was spent, obviously, and unfortunately the other partners, who had funded things, also lost money. I can’t really say how much. It wasn’t millions, but of course, it’s upsetting for all. The only small sense of satisfaction I got from the whole thing was that O’Leary lost money and I made money, as I owned the software and had simply licensed it to Toygaroo, and that license fee was paid.  ",e-Commerce,Bad Business Model,United States,"March 17, 2018",Phil Smy,https://www.failory.com/interview/toygaroo,"['https://www.youtube.com/philsmy', 'http://philsmy.com/', 'https://twitter.com/@psmy', 'http://zonmaster.com/']",failure,0,,"Toygaroo was the Netflix of toys.

256,trackin," Hi Failory! I have a master degree in Computer Science, and I’ve learned how to code and use computers when I was 12. I released my first website when I was 14 years old. At that time XHTML was fancy and JavaScript was the ENEMY. I was also leading a couple of video game teams that were at the top of the French scene. Even though I’m a ‘tech guy’, I’ve also always been a people person, which allowed me to build products while creating direct relationships with people who needed them and acquire skills that some techies might not have. I’m currently the CEO of Trackin, which has released the technology for any company to start a food delivery business within a day, and MobyDish, which is our main focus today. MobyDish is a full-catering online service for companies of 10 to 1000+ people. ‍",," Deciding to leave the life I’ve built in San Francisco to start Trackin was already a big step. I am an entrepreneur and wanted to get back to that life, but this time it meant giving up on a visa, job, life, friends, cheap place etc. Then getting back to France, it was hard for people to understand my ambitions, I kept hearing that I should start “slowly and not aim too high and slow down on international expansion” Follow your guts when you hear people telling you that it’s not the right thing to do and how to approach things is tough, because some people will be right about some aspects of your business, but some people will be wrong...so how do you know which one to listen to? Deciding to keep working on this adventure alone was another big challenge, and it has been since then. Getting into YC, talking to investors, managing your company...you are expected to do as well as other companies, even though you’re alone. I’ll always remember Michael Seibel during the program explaining to the batch how solo founders are supposed to be “superheroes” because expectations are at least the same and nobody will help out. Although I feel very fortunate, because looking back, I have learned so much about everything related to creating and growing a business: management, sales, hiring, marketing, accounting, technology, customer support, scalability, fundraising etc. There are days I wish I had more time to be a normal CEO, but overall, it’s a huge chance to be able to lead a growing company by yourself, because the amount of new skills you get is extremely valuable and will help you not only in your business life but also in your personal life. Everything becomes so easy! The last biggest challenge I had to face was being in the food space. We came late in the game and humans are not really objectives...After some bad investments were made, and after some companies failed, (mainly because of lack of business models and leadership), food suddenly became a ‘bad’ market. Which forced me to build a business sustainable and profitable right away instead of taking the VC shortcut. But at the end of the day, it made us stronger and we have solid foundations to scale! ‍  I’ve made huge hiring mistakes, multiple times, always ended well though, because I don’t think like you win anything by fighting with people for your ego. And I kept people for too long in the team when I knew they weren’t performing. ‍ We also made mistakes regarding our first targets with Trackin: we wanted to build the product for chains, but started talking to small businesses, so developed features based on their feedback, then realized chains were making more sense as target, but needed different features and had longer sales cycles. After trying to sell to chains and talking to experimented investors, I realized that to build a solid business I should sell to small businesses. A lot of them. Chains would ask for custom features and would take tons of time to make decisions, payments etc. Plus, they would represent a high percentage of your revenue and losing one of them could be meaning laying of people. Another mistake I’ve made was spending too much time to get money from government, loans, and contests. This is honestly all bullshit. It’s not because you’re winning contests that customers will show up, love your product and pay you. Contests are only good to have press articles and to get some credibility but it’s not a long-term strategy. This is still a common mistake made by entrepreneurs. The money helped me start hiring people, but the paperwork needed for it and still needed today wasn’t worth it. Keeping people too long in your team when you know they are creating problems or not performing the way you want is also a big mistake. I’ve tried to help and change too many people, at some point you can’t help everybody and need to hire people that will bring great things since day 1, especially in a startup. Then in a big corporation, you can do the opposite. Last but not least, as a co-founder of a company before Trackin, I’ve built the product with my engineers and my CEO without actually talking to the market. We thought we knew what people wanted when we actually didn’t. We spent almost a year building a product that didn’t make any sense to the market we targeted and closed almost as soon after we “launched”. ‍",,," I guess my last paragraph above answers this question. Being a solo founder, in the food space in the most expensive city of the world is not ‘ideal’ facing some of the most founded companies in that space. Luckily for us, things are doing great! :)"," I will always remember the first days working on Trackin. Looking for the right name, right domain, right design. I spent about 3 days working of the first version on the logo, and my computer crashed...my work on Photoshop was all gone before I got a chance to save it...Worst day of my life at that time, and first lesson learned...Save your work ALL THE TIME. I pitched the idea to a few people and a friend decided to join the journey as a backend engineer/DevOps while I’d take care of the rest. After a few months building the MVP, I’ve traveled to meet with restaurants, collect data and improve our tech and features. The first time I tried to show the product to restaurants, I was petrified. I felt like my baby, ideas and product were about to be judged for the first time. Fortunately, people liked it. Then, in order to scale, I needed to find money to hire some people. We won some French national contests, got money from the government, loans, banks, and other European awards that gave us enough to hire people. Unfortunately, my friend decided to leave the startup to focus on his full-time job instead of Trackin. ‍ With all the excitement around us and my knowledge of the food space, I decided to take over his role as well and kept working on Trackin as a solo founder. After six months of improvements, and a couple of press release, I closed our first paying customer (which wasn’t even a restaurant but an alcohol delivery company at night) and things became real. I officially incorporated the company and hired interns to get things going. Dealing with inquiries, marketing, and sales. The first version looked okay, but pretty bad for my current standard, and the new generation of employees was able to use it pretty easily. I’ve always enjoyed showing the product to someone and just stare at how the person would interact with it, where he would struggle, what kind of questions he would have...at that time there weren’t yet online tools to record the online experience and stream it back at you ) ‍ I will always remember how I was answering to calls from my first customers at 2 am. I would be pushing code and new Android apps based on their problems the minute we’d hang up to keep them happy (like connectivity issues, UX, etc.).  Our first pricing model was to charge per driver tracked on the platform, kind of salesforce charges for number of seats, but it didn’t make sense for restaurants. Then we decided to charge per deliveries. We felt like it was easier to convert restaurants this way because if they were just launching or were small, we were helping them grow faster, at a lower cost. If they were already established, they would pay more because they use us more and would improve their service, brand, and efficiency. When I’ve started, I knew nothing about sales processes, but I’ve learned by talking to people with more experience than me. Then I started to execute. We grew 10x in 4 months and I got lucky enough to sit down with Michael Seibel in my city (Lyon, France). After having dinner with him and sharing my story, he invited me to apply to YC. I didn’t think twice to jump on the opportunity, rented a house in San Jose, left my life in France, sold my furniture, gave up on my lease, prepared my employees, and moved back to California...Then I went through the program, learned a ton, fundraised enough to survive and then started to work on MobyDish.",," I’ve always been an entrepreneur. As a kid, I was a student of a private school, and hanging out with kids that received money from their parents. In order to have the same level of life than them and not be left behind, I would find out what students would need, and just make it happen! Before my work on Trackin, I was CTO of another catering company. One of our main pain points was the delivery and find out where the food was. It really makes you look bad to not be able to answer such question when the order size is worth $1k+. I quickly realized that it was a worldwide problem. Even the big brands like Pizza Hut didn’t know what was going on with their drivers as soon as they left a restaurant. I looked up online and didn’t find any technology to streamline deliveries, so I just went ahead, quit my job, my visa, my girlfriend, and life in San Francisco. I went back to France and started to work on the tech! Then long story short, I showed it around the world to different restaurants after a few months and an MVP, then I launched it, got some interesting growth and joined Y-Combinator.  Being half French and half Italian, I really care about food, and I couldn’t keep seeing people having bad experiences towards it. It definitely made sense to come up with technology so that people stop being scared to order food online and wait for hours without any news from the restaurant. Also, as a people person, I do care a lot about user experience and making people happy. With MobyDish, it is the perfect opportunity to have a huge impact on the food space and to connect people together, the right way. The idea is not just to feed people but to create such a great and easy experience, that we’ll democratize catering like Airbnb democratized renting apartments from individuals, globally. ‍",," I’d say there are not many secrets to growth. Combining techniques and doing it the right way by paying attention to details and knowing what you do is key. I’ve always been good at multitasking, and quick growth, to me, means combining many channels, then focus on the ones that work for your business. My main idea though as always trying to create a strong brand, and it has a lot to do with growth. People need to be emotionally attached to what I create. Long term, it decreases marketing costs, increases retention and organic growth. Online Marketing (SEO, Adwords, Blog, Content creation) Find out who your target is, what keywords they’re looking for when they have the pain points you’re trying to solve. Address these pain points through blog articles, short sentences for SEO and ads, etc. Establish your credibility by sending these in newsletters or on social media. ‍ Direct sales: Almost everything can be automated or outsourced nowadays. But when I started I did learn by doing all of it myself. Although I hadn’t realized how important it was to start with a good list of leads. Talking to salespeople I quickly came up with ideas on how to automate SDR, Follow up and Sales pitch. Constant email tweaks, A/B testing and looking at opening rates/conversion rate is key.   Product growth: Just think about ways your users can recommend you or add gamification for stickiness and make your users feel great about your product. Then when you make them feel great, invite them to talk about your product to someone else! I always use the Candy crush example. People love playing it because they feel great about themselves when they’re playing it. It’s fairly easy but challenging sometimes, and most and foremost, you get animations and congratulations for almost everything you’re doing. The game keeps praising your actions! I also like to make others laugh or feel good about themselves so the notifications in Trackin are pretty funny and different from what you would read in standard SAAS.  Getting a sense of self-improvement, especially regarding sales was amazing. Finding the right introductory sentence to get to talk to a manager and by-pass employees, being aware of what to answer based on questions, being able to read people concerns, see their reactions to the features we knew they would love...were all great feelings. Today with MobyDish, I love to hear customers from Silicon Valley (used to deal with the best products) how they enjoy working with us VS companies like Doordash, Caviar or others. Because these companies have raised millions and are hundreds, when we’re super small, profitable and mainly backed by angels, and still being the company they like most. Another funny fact is that some of the biggest VCs in Silicon Valley that have invested in these food companies, are using MobyDish to feed themselves :) ‍"," You can learn more about Mobydish here. You can visit Trackin here, but we’re not accepting new customers at the moment. And one day, I’ll have time again to share all my knowledge on my website!"," I think that learning from books is a great start, although it’s not always easy to remember everything and apply it in your life. If the book tells you to do one thing when a situation shows up, and if your emotions are taking over your brain or you just simply can’t remember what it was, then you’ll make the same mistakes again. Having some kind of routine to digest new lessons learned and what to do based on a specific situation is very important. I like to plan ahead and have a vision of what I want to do with my company long term, but it’s also very important to set shorter term goals, that will take you there and try to reach them. You’ll face new challenges that you will have to solve. Being highly focused on solving these problems one at a time, one after another and cut the distractions, will allow you to reach your main goal, then the next one and so on. As you’re facing these problems, you can then look for answers in books or ask people that have been through similar issues. Then looking back, you’ll realize how far you’ve gone. You can get to smart people from networks of entrepreneurs, incubators, alumnis of your school, or just shoot an email to someone you really want to talk to. Explain why you’re asking for his/her help.

257,tuff," I’m Ellen, founder of Tuff. We help startups unlock revenue by plugging in an on-demand growth marketing team.  We drive growth by creating the strategy and then executing Facebook and Instagram Ads, Google Ads, Google Shopping, Retargeting Campaigns, Landing Page Optimization, Link Building, Technical SEO, Content Strategy, and more.  Over the last three years, we’ve worked with 35+ different startups - from individual bootstrapped founders to large established players with multi-million dollar ad budgets. ",," Being a woman and the founder of a growth marketing agency has been pretty bumpy. I’ve been really lucky to have supportive partners and mentors but it can also be lonely and isolating. You learn to get really good at being outside your comfort zone almost 100% of the time.  One of the biggest challenges at Tuff has been building a fully remote team. This is a huge focus for us and I’ve had to systematically change the way I think about team culture and team building to get us to a place where we’re humming as a team, share values, and people are excited to log in to Slack in the AM.  Like any other startup, we’ve made a lot of mistakes, and continue to make mistakes and learn from those.  I think the biggest thing for me has been not acting quickly enough when we’ve made a mistake with hiring when there has been misalignment around the culture we’re building. One of our values at Tuff is creating a work environment where people can make mistakes, have ownership, grow, and learn. To make this possible, we have a clearly defined career framework so people know specifically how they can grow and develop in their role. This has been especially helpful as a small team because not everyone is going to (or wants to) grow into managing.  But, it took us two years to build. If I could go back a year or so, I would put more resources and time into building a career framework early that defined team roles, salaries, and career paths.  ",," We are growing slowly and intentionally. Right now, we have two open positions at Tuff and plan to double the team by the end of the year.   For our team, it’s not about churning out as many ads as possible or working on more than four or five accounts at once. We want to keep it this way, even as we scale up.   Our top three priorities are providing value to our clients, testing and running experiments, and creating a great place to work. ‍",," We’re still building Tuff! We have five full-time employees and aim to double our team size by next year.  It’s been an iterative process and one that we’re building on each day as more people join the team. I think, as your business grows, so does the complexity of hiring the right people. And finding the right growth marketing talent can be a huge obstacle. That’s why we’ve really put time and resources into the way we hire and grow the team at Tuff. The more diverse our team is, the more inclusive we can be in helping startups drive meaningful results.",," I believe entrepreneurs and startups with unique ideas deserve access to the best growth marketers available. My passion is working with small startups led by diverse founders who are solving problems others aren’t really thinking about.  And, I think the traditional agency model is crap. I was tired of seeing startups set back a year because they hired an agency (or in-house hire) that wasted their time and money with sloppy execution. So, I started to freelance. I got my first client (a partner we’re still working with today!), from a marketing agency that was over capacity and needed to find a home for a smaller client. They knew I could run Google campaigns and let me run with it.  The transition from freelancer to founder was a slow one and I had a lot to learn. Being out on my own was easy and I felt confident as a one-person team. I didn’t have much overhead, I could travel, work on my time and schedule, deliver results fast, and pick and choose who I worked with. But after about a year I knew I wanted something bigger and more meaningful with a group of smart and talented people, which is why we now have Tuff.  Before Tuff, I was a Head of Growth & Marketing for Uppercase, and previously on the marketing teams at Adaptly (acquired by Accenture) and Nielsen.  ‍"," I would have started saying ‘no’ earlier and more often.  Tuff’s mission is to build a team and culture where people can grow, are supported, and can help startups drive meaningful results. And as our founder, I’ve taken on a bunch of commitments and spread myself super thin. When that happens, I can’t be the leader of my team (or our partners!) needs.  I’m in a better “no” space these days, but if I could go back to a few years ago, I’d try to hone in on what really matters and strip away all the extra bullshit.  ‍"," We have a 5-Step Growth Marketing Framework that we use for our clients. And, we treat Tuff as a client.  It’s pretty simple and the theme is rapid experimentation. The framework lives in a Google Sheet and it helps us prioritize high-impact growth campaigns to quickly drive R.O.I. and key learnings, then invest in additional campaigns to scale up what works.  We start with foundation research. Then, list out as many growth tactics (paid, affiliate, content, events, pr, partnerships, etc) as we can be based on what we’re trying to achieve, select experiments based on impact, and then execute the campaigns. From there, we analyze the data and repeat it.  We test 3-5 new experiments per month for Tuff (we sponsored the Failory this month - this was one of our experiments!).

258,tweet-hunter," I’m a 32 years old French dude with 10 years of experience in marketing, product, and entrepreneurship. I live in Bordeaux, France. I’m the co-founder of Tweet Hunter, a bootstrapped SaaS making $41k/mo. We help people build and monetize a Twitter audience. I handle a good chunk of the product and the marketing. ‍",," It’s just always a challenge. We’re in a competitive space, and we strive to be the very best Twitter tool. So we’re constantly in a state where we’re working on a new killer feature, adding value to the product. It’s tough, but we have gotten the hang of it. It used to be that we were very good at inspiration and less good at other things like scheduling or automation. But I think we caught up nicely. Also, we weren’t ready for all the growth we had. Fun story (or not): a couple of times, we hit the daily quota of tweets we were allowed to post every day, which meant some scheduled tweets weren’t being published. Fortunately, we were able to sort things out with the team at Twitter, and we now have plenty of room for growth. Coming back to a personal level, I’ve had to deal with a couple of pretty hard things in my life in the past few months. Having Tweet Hunter go well during those tough times was a blessing. I can’t imagine what it would have been like if things weren’t going well professionally.  As a team, I think we’re very creative and love everything that’s shiny and new. It’s cool when you’re trying to figure out what to work on, but it turns into a disadvantage when you have something that works and you have to double down on your focus and start doing the same things multiple times. In other words, we get bored. In terms of product, we pack a LOT of features. Of course, this is great, but it also means we need to invest more into onboarding, help center, explanations, etc. We started with a minimal set of features and had 0 support and no help articles. Now we need to gear up. Not everyone is used to using SaaS tools and we need to take that into account. As for mistakes we made, well, there’s a ton. We have the luxury of making decent revenue, so sometimes we don’t spend on the right things. There are a few marketing efforts we invested in that didn’t pay off (yet). ‍",," We love going from the idea stage to the revenue-generating stage. I don’t know yet if we’re going to want to build a significant team around our product. It’s not in our DNA, but you never know. I think Tibo and I want to find a way to keep the growth going on Tweet Hunter and also, at some point, build new products. We’ll see what the future holds. In terms of pure revenue, we want to hit $1M ARR in 2022. On a more personal level, my goal for the year is to buy a house.  ‍",," About a week went by between the idea and the launch. On the tech side, there was Tibo and another dev who ended up not wanting to get more invested in the project. And on the product and marketing side, I did my best. It took a few days to build something very basic but usable: a searchable tweet library and a sign-up flow with the ability to pay. We set out for a price of $9/mo, thinking we were being super ambitious (spoiler: we weren’t). And we launched. On Twitter and Reddit, basically. Immediately we started getting sign-ups and a few paid customers. Tibo and I believed we were on to something and decided to spend all our time on it.",," Up until a year ago, I was working in a product position at a startup. My former co-founder Tibo (who I had built a startup with a few years ago) reached out to me. This informal “how are you doing” conversation led to me quitting my job and going back to full-time entrepreneurship within a few weeks. We had no product idea. But we had a problem in mind: how can we help other makers find users for their products? We thought the best way to solve this was to actually confront ourselves with the problem. So we made a bunch of products that took a few days to build, and we launched them. After a while, I realized Tibo was bringing in a few new customers very early after launch, thanks to his decently followed Twitter account. I thought: “Man, I’m the marketing guy and he’s bringing the users, that sucks, I have to start tweeting”. So I did. And I was terrible at it. It turns out we had a tweet database that we had been using for another project, and we thought we could turn that into a product that could inspire people for their own tweets. So we made it. I used it. And immediately, I got better at tweeting and spent a lot less doing so. This is how it all started. ‍"," For Tweet Hunter, 2 things come to mind: Start with a higher price point (always do that).Include tweet scheduling right from the start. With those, we maybe would have even better numbers today, but honestly, I’m pretty happy about all the choices we made. These are minor details that perhaps could have improved the outcome just a little bit. But if I had to go way back into the past, I should have started my Twitter account sooner than I did, but I’m glad I ended up doing it. And I should have gone to engineering school or taken a dev Bootcamp rather than business school. ‍"," We did a lot of stuff. Our first launch happened through our Twitter accounts and in a few subreddits. We were also leveraging the email list we had built from previous products we made. Then we started making free side products and resources that we launched on Product Hunt. Doing this helped us reach $5K MRR within 3 months. And then we partnered up with JK Molina, a pretty well-known tweet writing and Twitter growth expert with a nice audience around that topic. He loved the product and wanted to join us, and we were happy to welcome him as a part-owner of the product. He launched toward his audience, and in a matter of weeks, we tripled our MRR. At that point, we had also developed a lot of new features like scheduling, automations, and other core features for people who want to grow on Twitter. We had also raised our prices to what they are today. In the past month, our growth has mainly been organic. We like to do “eventful” stuff, so we organized a Twitter growth contest, a Twitter growth conference, and a few more things like that to stay top of mind whenever someone thinks about using a Twitter tool. ‍", You can check out Tweet Hunter and say hello on Twitter!," I’ll be very honest: I’m not a huge reader/watcher/listener of startup content. Some of the resources out there are undoubtedly great. But when I take a break from work, I truly take a break. I don’t go and listen to a startup podcast. But it doesn’t mean I haven’t read or listened to a few things: My favorite startup book is the 4-hour Work Week, because it made me want to be a time millionaire more than a $USD millionaire. I learn a lot of things from people on Twitter. And my favorite blog in the world is Wait But Why. ‍",,Social Media,,France,"May 28, 2022",Tom Jacquesson,https://www.failory.com/interview/tweet-hunter,"['https://tweethunter.io/', 'https://twitter.com/tomjacquesson']",success,1,$25k-$100k/mo,"Tweet Hunter helps people build and monetize their Twitter audiences.

259,twitch-highlights," Tzelon: Hey, I’m Tzelon, a 30-years-old, frontend developer and maker from Israel. Though at the moment I’m doing research on the question “How to launch a product as a Maker?” I’m learning about the process one should go through before launching a product. From building an audience to what to do after the launch. With that knowledge, I’m creating a tool for Makers, to guide them through the process. You can check it out at CreateCamp.co.   Ron: Hi, I’m Ron, 30-year-old software developer, studied computer science at the IDC Israel, an addicted podcast listener and an amateur poker player. Tzelon and I are friends since we were 6-year-old, we share the same passion for creating our own things, over the years we have started many projects and abandoned them soon after. We always waited for the “right time” to take a leap of faith and work on something full time, until Twitch Highlights. ‍ What was Twitch Highlights? Twitch.tv is a live streaming platform focused on video game live streaming, the streams are interactive as the streamer talk to the viewers and they can chat with him. The average length of a stream is ~8 Hours. That's very long… most of the viewers don’t watch the entire stream. But what if the most interesting\entertaining part of the stream happens when you are not watching?  This is where Twitch Highlights kicks in, we analyzed the stream and created a short video with only the most interesting and entertaining parts of it. ‍"," We failed to build an audience around Twitch Highlights. After we couldn’t find any beta testers it’s was hard to continue, our motivation and momentum were declining fast, very fast! There was no one to give us feedback on our work and tell us it was useful for them. If you can’t help others with your product you have no energy to work on it. Instead of confronting with our real problem, we tried to improve Twitch Highlights by adding more features, classic mistake. It didn’t took long until we realized we fail to execute on our idea, we run out of money and with no potential users on the horizon we had to go back to work.",,,,," We knew it’s important to validate our idea before jumping into coding. We followed the “The Lean Product Playbook”, we create personas with their struggles and needs. We work to refine the feature list that we will build to our MVP, we also created a landing page and sent cold emails to professional streamers. We got few responses from streamers who recognize the problem from their daily routine, and a lot of silence from others. Taking all we learn from that week, we jumped right into coding, using Computer Vision algorithms and OCR to detect objects and text on the video, setting up our environment on Amazon servers and Lambda functions. We worked on it for three months, writing code and nothing else. We loved it! We had no knowledge in Computer Vision so we needed to learn it from scratch. We use Node.js and found a great open source library for Computer Vision, Opencv4nodejs, the owner of the library was very helpful and kind, thanks Vincent Mühler. He helped us get started and after a few weeks, we were able to analyze a video stream from different perspectives. First, we tried to figure out what is currently happening in the game so we started to look for text messages that were displayed in the game such as “Victory Royale” in Fortnite, this way we knew that we have detected an interesting message, the streamer won the game. Another perspective was looking at the messages frequency at Twitch.tv chat, we figured out that when there is an anomaly in the average messages per second, something interesting might have happened and the viewers are going crazy. So by combining those and some other “secret” indicators, we have figured out pretty well what are the interesting moments and extract them. We still had a long way ahead of us, but we minimize editing time of a stream from ~12 hours to ~4 hours! Three months in, we wanted to get some beta testers, but we failed to make connections in the streamers world. The streamers who were willing to talk to us before didn’t answer our emails now, and it was hard to find professional streamers to try our product in other social networks. It was our first obvious failure. ‍",," As enthusiastic Twitch viewers with families and a full-time job as developers, we couldn’t watch all the full streams as they are very long (~8 Hours), but we didn’t want to miss it entirely, so we took inspiration from sports, mostly NBA. Shortly after each NBA game a highlights video with the most interesting moments of the game was available on the NBA website. We have tried to build many things over the years and we thought that we need to go “all-in” on Twitch Highlights for it to succeed. We quit our jobs and start working on it every day. Our business model was simple, streamers will use Twitch Highlights in order to generate highlights videos out of their raw streams, and by doing so they will increase their overall viewers number. The equation was pretty clear to us, as a streamer “more viewers” = “more revenue” so as long as we will help the streamers make more money they will be willing to pay for Twitch Highlights monthly subscription."," Tzelon: I definitely would work very hard on building an audience around Twitch Highlights, and my personal online presence before I quit my job. I always thought that be 100% on something will guarantee its success, but I now think we should as makers, first build a platform on which we could build our products, and building this platform takes time, months even years, it includes knowing who we want to serve, get involved with that community, building our reputation with them and really live with them. I'm here to run a marathon, not a sprint.   Ron: I would have spent more time on networking and building a community around the problem first, before going after the solution. We have started working on the product without gathering enough “intel” from our audience and actually make sure that it is a real pain for them and they do see the value of our solution. Because we are developers the easiest part for us is the actual execution so we just jumped into it as fast as we can, even though we knew that the validation and market research part is crucial. So I would definitely spend more time on research, planning, validating before writing the first line of code. But I think that the main reason that we rushed into building the product is that we were scared that our time will run out, in terms of our savings. ‍"," We failed to understand how important it is to have marketing strategies and build an audience around Twitch Highlights. Yes, we tried sending cold emails, post on forums and Reddit. But it’s hard to get anyone attention this way for a brand new product when no one knows you. ‍"," Tzelon: You can follow me on Twitter, I’m now working on my personal blog.   Ron: My Twitter handle is @ronco1st."," Tzelon: I love Justin Jackson (@mijustin) podcasts, “Build you SaaS” and “Product People” and his blog. Great books I recommend for every entrepreneur are “Getting Real” and “Zero to One”. There are great communities I’m part of like IndieHackers and MegaMaker. ‍ Ron: I consume most of my knowledge from audio, mostly podcasts and audiobooks my favorite podcast is “Hashavua”, a podcast in Hebrew that was made by two incredible guys that shared their experience and interviewed so many great entrepreneurs, I have listened to the entire show twice :), very recommended for Hebrew speakers. “Lean Startup” is also an amazing resource and can really help in working in the right process. ‍"," Some numbers, we live in Israel so we were burning about 2500$ a month from our savings just to put food on our table and rent an apartment (We are both married). We spend about $500 on AWS servers and lambda.

260,unicorn-platform," Salut! My name is Alexander Isora. I'm 27 y.o. solo-founder of Unicorn Platform — the landing page builder for startups. The bootstrapped project is profitable and currently serves 5,000+ websites. If you are curious how did I managed to launch this $4,000+ MRR SaaS, welcome to this interview 🤓 ‍ I live in Russia. This country is just awesome to kickstart a tech company because the cost of living here is small. I live in a beautiful city - Saint Petersburg. Happy me can behold heartstopping architecture every day.  It is important to me to be constantly inspired. Beauty around gives me pushes to bring more beauty in the world. ‍ Unicorn Platform today is a team of 3 passionate people: Asad, the COO. A young man with a colossal potential. His keenness often surprises our clients and me.Artem, the frontend developer. Artem has the diligence of a soldier.Me, the CEO. I do UI/UX design, coding, marketing, business development. The story begins in July 2018, when I built and launched an MVP… 👇 ‍",," There is one thing I can not get over for many years. This is a dead simple, obvious and quite a popular problem: I work too much. When I work a lot, I can finish many things. This sounds fine in theory, but in reality it is not true. It turned out that the less I work the better my results and the longer run I can go. Let 's see why. First, working too much makes me feel low energy and in the end - burn out. Gosh, I burn out 2 times a year!  Burning out means I can not do any other job that is responding in the support chat. No strategy planning, no hiring, no creative posts, no product improvements, no updates, no new connections. Each burnout removes 20-25 productive days of my life.  Now we will do some simple math. Imagine, I work 10 hours a day instead of 8.  Ur-r-rrgh, I can go even more hardcore! Let’s add an extra working day - Saturday.  It will add 104 additional working days per year. Yay! I can do more coding, more design, more this and that. This is just a-w-e-s-o-m-e, isn't it? 😁 But this lifestyle will end in 50 wasted days during the burnouts and restoring. Besides, each hardcore 10 hours day ends with falling down in the bed with zero energy in the batteries. It means I can not spend quality time with the family. Also, I can not contribute to my hobbies which make my life brighter and eventually help to be more productive, focused and creative at work by giving me a mind relax.  So I try to follow this simple rule: work as little as possible. Here are some tips that help: I leave the laptop at the workspace. If there is something urgent, I can use my spouse's laptop (there were 0 urgent accidents since 2018).Tick-tack. It is 7 p.m. You stand up and go out of the work space. Just shut down the Mac and go away. No questions asked. Just do it.2 vacations per year. Unfortunately, I can not afford a vacation at this moment. But this is something I want to bring back to my life.Weekends were invented to have a rest. So rest! ‍"," Wix added their stocks on NASDAQ before I even learned to code.  SquareSpace booked an ad at Super Bowl (~$5 million for a 30-second commercial). WordPress serves 50% of the entire goddamn Internet! And there are other competitors. A lot of competitors. Trust me, I tested ~all existing website builders and I know the amount. It is crazy. So how is there a space for a new self-funded russia-based website builder founded by a single person?  Oh my friend, I see a huge HUGE space out there! 😌  Allow me to explain myself. The products of big popular companies definitely have good parts. They are stable, reliable, they have solid community and infrastructure. But with complexity some disadvantages come. Your feature requests and ideas will never be heard, you will drown in help guides, plugins and themes. If there are any problems with payment or the product, you will be on your own. When people are fed up with ignorance, confusion and bad experience, they start to look around. Thousands and thousands of people start searching and sometimes find newborn projects like Unicorn Platform. We are 2 years old. It is enough to build an initial trust to give it a try. And this is where we need to make a good impression and show that you are in good hands. People choose Unicorn Platform because of 3 main reasons: 1. Focus on a small audience.  Our website builder is niched down. It is made for founders and marketeers from SaaS companies, mobile and desktop apps and other tech startups. Narrow focus gives us an ability to provide a product that fits the needs of this small audience very well. For example, you can frame your apps screenshot into a realistic 3D device: ‍ None of the giants will care this much about the owners of mobile apps because the strategy of the big companies is to conquer the whole world. They need to serve 1,000 different audiences, whereas our goal is to satisfy a small group of people. 2. Simplicity. Since our product is small, we do not have all the endless features that the major website builders have. Cut down the loose, keep it simple - this is the secret recipe of a good user experience. If someone needs more power or a feature that we do not have, our support crew will provide a piece of custom code for free. 3. Support. A+ blazing fast passionate support crew which contains engineers-only 😎 It makes a huge impression on our users. We will cover this part later in this interview. ‍"," We have 5,091 users in September 2020 and the number is growing. ‍ My goal, metric and the main purpose why I wake up in the mornings is to make these 5,000 people as satisfied as possible. There is a simple trick to make a user happy: bring more value than the price is. By shaping our product we bring joy to our users. When they get requested features, people feel cared for and listened to. It gives a deep feeling of warmth and helps to build a strong connection.  Next, exciting product updates make users feel like winning a lottery. Imagine, you already agreed to pay X for the Y amount of features. And then there is a surprise: an additional feature comes out and you can use it for no additional cost. Cool! We try to bring such gifts every month.  And the last but not the least: good user support. Not just good - splendid, astonishing, lightning fast and thoughtful. Just like if you have a skilled engineer on your team. Thanks to the COO Asad, our support process was dramatically boosted. It is so well maintained, users send us odes. ‍ We spend a limitless amount of time to make their experience smooth and fun. I believe that support is a huge part of Unicorn Platform (at least a half!).  When a new user joins - no matter on a free or a paid plan - we take them as a part of the family. And when a user feels like being truly accepted to a family treated accordingly, they become loyal and spread Unicorn Platform around the world. This is how we manage growth - we get by giving.",," The MVP of Unicorn Platform was built in just 160 hours. I have explained the whole journey in this popular article. The biggest question in developing an MVP was to decide when to stop.  We imagine our future product so huge and grandiose and scalable and powerful and and…  But in reality the simpler your MVP is the better. It is hard to shut up your inner Steve Jobs, but it is required if you want to deliver real things, not words. I had a solid experience in the market. And I knew exactly the amount of features which would be required to start sales. Thus, building the very first version of Unicorn Platform was a breeze (~˘▾˘)~ The next step was to launch the newborn project. I published Unicorn Platform on Product Hunt. Yet I was sure about the product quality and its market need, I did not know how good the sales would be. In case of zero or low cash flow I would need to get back to a desk job. So I crossed my fingers and clicked “publish”. The crowd was awed by the quality of the MVP version of Unicorn Platform. That launch brought me $5,892 of subscription sales and $9,271 in lifetime deal licenses sales. As I said, living costs in my city are low. This is why the sum was enough to build a more powerful version of the website builder which is now available to the world and used by thousands of users.  Let’s talk more about it 😄",," Idea picking is the hardest thing: you are afraid to invest time and money in a pointless project. I understand this fear 🙌 I believe the only true way to pick an idea which you will be able to carry on for years is to follow your heart. What do you truly love? Traveling, databases, bikes, cats, websites, music? Pick an industry first. If you do not know, perhaps you need to start becoming interested in a wider range of things: make new connections, visit local events, try something new.  Keep being curious and you will notice real problems to solve. Then just do some customer development to validate your ideas. I simply did this: started being interested in coding and fell in love with the websites 🥰  I started my career as a web developer in 2014. After 100 created websites every web developer starts to think about making their own website builder. There is nothing romantic about finding this idea 😅 The problem is to get confidence and quit the job to follow the dream. It took me 2 years working as a web developer and 2 years of working as an  entrepreneur to get to the point where I could say “I can do it!”. After gaining enough experience, wisdom and confidence I decided to quit my current job position and build the product. I remember that moment very well: a crystal clear understanding of what and how should be done. I’m sorry for saying it like this is an easy-peasy question. This is definitely not.  Idea picking is hard and requires diligence and luck. Let me know if you have problems with ideas. Perhaps I can help or at least show you my ideas list to give some inspiration. ‍"," Do not listen to the ones who teach you how to be an entrepreneur (not even to me! 😂).  Each entrepreneur’s story is unique. It is like writing music: you can learn notes at music school, but you will still need to compose them in the right order to create a symphony. Same with business: you can learn how to run a Google Ad, but you need experience on how and when to launch such an ad. No one knows when your particular project needs this.  And you yourself will not know until you spend a few grand either. This is why I encourage you to try and fail, try and fail.  Watching smart videos may feel like progress, but without actual practice this is nothing but old good procrastination. ‍  There is one thing that I’m missing and it can not be fixed: a partner. If I could invert myself in time, go back to the past and talk to my former self in the past, I would spend some time and try to find a fiddy-fiddy co-founder who will share responsibility and help me during hard times. Being alone, I need to constantly work on myself and improve my discipline, learn new huge skills (e.g. managing a team). I also need to take care of the slippery biz dev parts such as legal and finance by myself. This is tough. I often feel exhausted. A partner would be a great addition. However, moving solo gives me enormous decision making speed. Boy, I move 5 times faster than when I was working with partners! ‍"," Most of the time we are working on the product.  I’m interested in growing our MRR and user base, but our top priority will always be the product. I’m a fanatic. My passion is the product. And I want to continue shaping it.  I do not feel like I want to spend much time on promoting Unicorn Platform. Instead, I believe a good service can grow by itself. I will talk about it in the next chapter of this interview. Nevertheless, I regularly discover new marketing channels.  My current bet is side-project marketing. I believe I can bring value by building something useful for startup folks and therefore drive attention to Unicorn Platform.  My current side-project which I’m evolving is Broadwise.org. Broadwise.org is an old school online forum for discussing tech, design, marketing and other startup-related topics. I believe in the subforums-based form of communication and have big plans for the project. Welcome! 😁 ‍", Thanks for the interest in my humble person.

261,uptrend," My name is Maverick. I was born and raised in Singapore. I’m 22 and I’ve just got out of the army.A few years ago, I founded Uptrend, a consultancy that specialized in deal sourcing for M&A firms. The business model was a B2B lead generation agency.  It had a very lean operation - I handled everything, leveraged automation software, and outsourced menial tasks such as designs. In Jan 2020, Uptrend was shut down. Writing this interview really helped me reflect on the things I could have done better so thanks Failory! ‍"," The failure boils down to 3 things: Timing: During the 2019 period, the economy was still booming, and many business owners weren’t willing to sell their business. Outreach campaigns could get leads but most of these business owners looking to sell would just flake after the first few calls which made it hard for these advisors to pay for my monthly retainer. Some of the advisors I worked for wanted to target regional businesses and this was really difficult. Others were very niched down, meaning they targetted a specific industry such as renewable energy or healthcare, and it was relatively easy to get results for them. But again, they were flaky leads and low volume due to the timing issue. The market only started moving after the COVID-19 incident, which signaled the start of a recession. Many business owners feared the repercussion and wanted a way out. The buyers were also willing to grab a share of the market given the falling prices. Branding issues: Poor choice of domain name that didn’t really convey intent. Despite the rather small niche in the U.S, no one remembers the brand of Uptrend neither does it tell them what we do. It was a fundamental problem that I failed to realize until my friend got me into domaining. Lack of tools: I didn’t have the necessary resource or tools to develop a database of business owners for these advisors. Most of these advisors’ ideal clients tended to be old people who weren’t on any form of social media. They also tended to be skeptical about everything and only trusted referrals. I decided to shut down operations on the 10th-month mark as I was burning out. I couldn’t see any foreseeable future with it - even if I had gotten more clients, I wouldn’t have been able to scale it much as the niche was small and retaining clients was a major problem. I felt lost because I didn’t know what I would do next. I could go back to running an agency, but I would have to put myself through the same torture again. During the period, I also picked up a couple of other projects with my buddy. Things got overwhelming so I decided to shelf some of them.",,,,," I first invested in a really expensive course (around $2k) which taught me how to start a consulting agency. It was a large sum of money to me at the time, and I wanted to get back my return on investment. The initial idea was generating leads for RE agents through Facebook. I then also began sending cold emails to try to land deals. It was through a lot of trial and error, that I kind of struck cold.  My cold email copy and strategy could land a 10% call rate.  It was a unique experience as I was pitching to New Zealand real estate agents from Singapore. I realized I was no longer restricted by my geolocation as I could land cross border deals. However, I soon started to get demotivated as I couldn’t hold a sales call for more than 5 minutes before prospects hang up. I didn’t have the skills or system to close deals. So one thing led to another and I met an M&A advisor on a FB group who became my accountability partner while snooping around in Facebook groups. He introduced me to the Sandler sales system and taught me a thing or two about closing deals. Soon, he decided to hire me to help him out with his firm. Things took off from there, I knew a lot more about this niche itself and I knew the main problem these M&A advisors faced. I went 100% into it because I realized I could solve their problems."," Mainly just cold emailing and using Linkedin for direct outreach. I posted blog content on LinkedIn groups once every 2 weeks. Starting was darn slow, but as I got my messaging dialed-in, I got more and more sales calls. The initial solution was generating leads through Facebook ads. But after the first 10 sales call, I realized that this wouldn’t be the right application given that we’re dealing with businesses (B2B) while Facebook was more suited for consumers (B2C). That’s also why I pivoted to generating leads through Linkedin. ‍ I bombed my first 60-70 sales calls, as I was still getting better at sales. Think of it as learning to ride a bicycle the first few times. You probably suck at it and fell many times before you can ride smoothly. Pitching to these 7-9 figure guys was not easy. They were sharpshooters, brutal, and would tear my sales pitch apart. I had my ego bruised real bad, but after a while, I kinda became immune to rejections. It was only from the 80-100 calls onwards that I started to get better at sales. I started noticing similar patterns of smokescreen these guys would throw. Things got easier because I was fully prepared. I entered each call knowing what these guys were going to say, and how I could counter their objections. That’s when I started closing clients and getting paid (3 clients at $2k retainer). That hurdle was over, but delivering results and retaining clients was a bigger problem I couldn’t solve, and eventually led to the downfall of Uptrend Consulting. ‍"," Just before Uptrend Consulting, I was studying for my degree. I was also actively involved as a student-athlete for the Singapore weightlifting team.  I enjoyed the “grind” of having to balance school and sports, which gave me a sense of purpose. But once school was over, I was stuck in this vacuum of time wondering what I really wanted in life.  This was about 4 months prior to enlistment. That was the “oh shit” moment when reality hit me. Lifting weights wasn’t a feasible option during the 2 years of service, neither was it after. I set down and thought real hard about it, and came to the conclusion that financial stability and freedom was what I truly wanted.  So I decided to drop the sport of weightlifting and dedicated the 2 years’ downtime to focus on building a business and fixing my injuries (2 shoulder surgeries).  I had to start from scratch as I didn’t have any skills at all. Uptrend Consulting was largely failed experiment of constant pivoting to find a market fit. ‍"," I’d steal existing ideas because they are already pre-validated. Pick a generic niche like Roofers or Dentists, and study the top guys in the market. Figure out what those guys offer, how are they branding themselves, reverse engineer their success. The other important thing is getting the branding down, so a solid domain name and a good copy would have easily set me apart from the rest. I’d look for freelancers with experience in the niche and leverage their results to secure the clients. Skip the step of needing proof of concept because the idea and results are already validated.  I’d just focus heavily on securing the first 10 clients while fully outsourcing the service delivery. Eventually, build an internal team that fulfills the delivery to keep cost low, and reinvest more capital into promoting the service itself through organic and paid traffic means. ‍",," Currently working on Endorsive where we help entrepreneurs save more time through automation, delegation, and systems.

262,upvoty," I’m Mike, a 34-year old entrepreneur from Holland. I’m the founder of user feedback tool Upvoty and the host of the SaaS Pirates Podcast. I started working on Upvoty 3 years ago after I saw an opportunity to create a user feedback tool. After hiring a small team of devs and marketers, we launched the first beta version in August 2018, and during the beta, we immediately noticed that our product had the potential to become a successful SaaS product. We launched in February 2019, and within a couple of months, we reached $1,000 MRR. Right now, fast forward to 2021, we’re at $20,000 MRR, and we’re growing with over $1,000s a month. Since I’m not a developer myself, I have outsourced almost all of the tasks regarding Upvoty. I have developers working on the software, marketers working on marketing activities such as our ""Upvoty on Product"" blog, and this leaves room for me to work on my vlog and podcast. ",," With Upvoty, we - luckily - didn’t have any significant obstacles yet. But I’m sure they’ll come because it’s inevitable when you’re building a business. But, like Ryan Holiday stated in his book: ""The Obstacle is the way"". And this is something I always keep in mind. I never see things as an obstacle or as a bad thing. ‍",," We’re working with a fully remote team of 8, and we managed to grow organically to now $20,000 MRR. We are looking to hire new team members, especially customer support since we’re growing in users (over 500 companies are using our software right now). Next year, we want to achieve an MRR of over $50,000, which sounds ambitious, but our strategy is to go all-in on sales and advertising. Personally, my goal is to grow my YouTube channel by vlogging even more. I’m not yet at 11,000 subscribers let’s go and get that silver play button ). ",," We launched a landing page with an explainer video and a signup form, and we asked people to sign up if they were interested in such a product like Upvoty. That product validation was straightforward and something I’ve learned from the Dropbox story.  Within 2 months, we had over 300 sign-ups and, mainly because we also wanted to build the product for our own, we decided to work on it. Most of those signups came from communities such as Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, Makerlog, and platforms such as BetaList. Besides that, we launched a couple of eBooks, went all-in on content marketing (blog), and did a lot of interviews (which not only boosted our brand, but also our SEO rankings). I also shared it within my network (back then I had a pretty big following base on both Instagram and YouTube), and I participated in FB groups a lot, just to attract some first beta users. Within 3 months, we built a first version, which was a very slim and basic version of what the product is today, but it had everything we needed to go to the next validation stage: How will our customers use it. The actual validation came soon after our first public launch: Paying customers! From that moment on, we kept listening to our customers (of course by using our software) and started building features based on their needs and pain points.",," So, back in early 2018, my team and I were growing with a previous SaaS product. That SaaS startup was doing over $1,000,000 ARR. And with that growth in users, the amount of feedback was increasing as well. Back then, we were documenting feedback in a spreadsheet, but at one point, this wasn’t sustainable anymore. When researching other user feedback tools, I quickly noticed an opportunity to build one of my own. I thought of making a new product instead of using existing ones because I wasn’t fulfilled anymore working on the product we were working on. Although we had created a fantastic product, I wasn’t passionate enough about the market we were serving and decided to sell it. This also became one of my biggest lessons learned: If you’re not passionate enough about solving your customer’s problems, it’s not going to work in the long run. ‍"," Like I mentioned earlier, the biggest lesson is to work on something you’re passionate about. Otherwise, it will kill you in the long run. Another thing I’ve learned from launching over 5 products is: Narrow down your target audience, especially when you’re just starting out. I always like to say: Dream big, start small. Make sure your product is helping a couple of customers in the best way possible and expand later on."," From the start, we focused on content marketing. Our ICPs (ideal customer profiles) consist mainly of early staged founders or product managers. Both are keen on learning new things. So by providing content that could help them build a better product, we could convince them to use a tool like Upvoty because, as we experienced first hand, manually documenting all the feedback and requests isn’t sustainable and requires a lot of time and work. We also launched a couple of ebooks, did a lot of interviews, sponsored some podcast shows, and of course, I promoted Upvoty to my audience on YouTube. But, the best marketing strategy was our product. Not because it’s a fantastic product (at least, we think so), but because we’ve added a ‘Powered by Upvoty’ mention and link in our feedback portal. We get referrals from our own product because the customers of our customers also want to use such feedback software. Every time our customers share their Upvoty feedback portal or boards, new potential customers see our name. If they need a feedback tool themselves, they will click through, sign up for a trial, and stick around. "," You can follow me on my blog, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter."," My personal and business life entirely runs on Asana. So, I can recommend using a project management or task manager app such as Asana. I just store every task, future to-do, or idea in the app. This helps me clear my mind, and it also enables me to focus on what I have to do right now without worrying about all the things after. One book I can recommend, especially when you’re building a SaaS, is Intercom on Starting Up. It helped me with every aspect of building a product from scratch.

263,urban-masterclass," Hey there! My name is Chris Schwartze and I’m a 25-year-old entrepreneur and music producer from Enschede, The Netherlands. Like many others, in my early days, the internet struck a chord with me. In 2009 I stumbled upon music production because of this video from Ryan Leslie. The ability to create music from nothing to something in your bedroom fuelled my creativity. I co-founded Urban Masterclass with my best friend and cousin Robin. Since 2011, Robin sells his beats online to singers and rappers on his website Robin Wesley Instrumentals. Earlier in 2017, when we conducted research on his email list, we found out that 400+ of his artists repeatedly struggled with songwriting, mixing and recording. We both thought there was an opportunity because we couldn't find anything online that solved these problems—without tying together all the pieces yourself. Instead of coaching artists one by one, we decided to pack all our knowledge and expertise into an online masterclass. Depending on the masterclass, we offer one-off payments and payment plans. Once a student enrolls, he or she can log in and access the masterclass. ‍",," We tried a lot but never really saw the traction. Of course, we managed to get in a few new students, but we couldn't find a scaleable marketing channel. It was frustrating because our pre-order did well. Most of the students that converted on the pre-order where Robin's loyal customers from years ago (so that was a bit of a ""red flag""). We knew that we needed to build stronger relationships with artists and change their beliefs about investing in online courses if we wanted to be truly successful. In the summer of 2018, Robin and I were out for dinner and we talked about the state of Zero to Radio Ready and how to continue (don't worry, he was laughing about the size of the chicken on my plate). We were frustrated and we both thought it was time for a pivot.  Before launching Zero to Radio Ready, we should've conducted more interviews with customers and prospects. This would've helped us in tremendously with positioning and copywriting. Another mistake is that we didn't give Zero to Radio Ready all we got in terms of marketing. We could've pushed it further, and maybe traction was around the corner. But as months passed, we were less and less motivated. My own mistake is probably buying a tool we didn't need. It cost us around $800 but we ended up not using it and used a free product instead that did the job much better (if you read this Robin, I'm sorry). ‍",,," Our biggest disadvantage was probably time. We both needed to work on our own business to pay the bills. And we wanted to bootstrap Urban Masterclass. So we had to be very strict about certain decisions and say no to some opportunities. There were times where Robin or I could only spend one hour a week. One of my personal disadvantages is that I'm not a developer. I can read code, and I'm pretty good at CSS but that's about it. So it was a lot of trial and error to build our own WordPress theme from scratch. But in the end, it was well worth it because now we have our own API and we're in total control of the design 💪. ‍"," We already decided we wanted to do a pre-order launch to get our first students. And that the masterclass should cover songwriting, recording, and mixing. The masterclass is called (from) Zero to Radio Ready and enrolment starts at $249. Robin initially only created a fraction of all the course content. And I used a WordPress page builder to quickly design a pre-order landing page. When validating a product, you have to be careful with your time in case your hypothesis doesn't work out. For the course platform we used Teachable and for the email, we used Robin's existing ActiveCampaign account. Around October 2017, it was time to start the pre-order phase. Together, we wrote seven emails that were spread over one week. Included in the email automation, was a 30% pre-order discount that would disappear after the pre-order window was over. Nothing fancy. The pre-order did roughly $2000 in sales and we ended up with 12 students. That was enough validation for us! In the weeks after that, Robin focused on finishing the course, while keeping our early students engaged in the process. Here's what the first version of the course looked like in Teachable. I shifted my attention to designing our homepage, and a new sales page. Also, setting up different tools like BigPicture for tracking our marketing efforts. Remember that we were limited in our time because Robin had to work on his main business, and I was mostly occupied by freelance clients. Luckily, the early pre-orders gave us a bit of runway to pay for the tools and our time. ‍",," Back in 2008—when I was a 16-year old kid, with no sense of direction—I was looking for a study. Music seemed like the most natural path but I wasn’t confident enough nor did I have the skills yet. I decided to study web design. One of my teachers introduced me to HTML, CSS and eventually WordPress. I was sold. Long story short, I failed that study twice (yes, twice) and called it quits after two years. I felt miserable and my parents were disappointed… perhaps college wasn’t for me. ‍ I decided to quit I've always enjoyed working and getting my hands dirty. I got my first job when I was 13 years old, delivering a weekly paper where I made about $6 per 500 deliveries. Awful! But hey, I was young and it paid for gaming, clothes etc. Anyhoo, I decided to quit school in 2010 and work in a restaurant whilst I figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Between shifts, I had a lot of time to think and on the off-days I was making more music than ever before. After years of no contact, I got back in touch with Robin in 2011 and it turned out he was producing the same style of music (and even selling it online). The fact that he was actually making money online and that it was a side-business blew me away. And this was my first proper introduction to online marketing and selling digital products. ‍ Takeoff Three years later, I took a leap of faith and auditioned for the Herman Brood Academy, a well-known music school in the Netherlands. I didn't think I was good enough, but I got it in 😮! During my second year at HBA, I couldn't stop consuming content and thinking about marketing. After I graduated the Herman Brood Academy in 2016 I started working full-time as a waiter. On the side, I did some web design at Heroic Academy—a course platform and blog for electronic music producers. Eventually, that led me to join the Heroic Academy team full time and later on become Head of Marketing. Budi Voogt and Tim van Doorne—the co-founders of Heroic—taught me a lot about online marketing, management, and transparency. And here's where all the pieces came together. Years later, and Robin and I were still talking every day. About our side projects, marketing ideas and so on. As I said earlier, every time an artist joined Robin's email list, he or she will get an automated survey. This allowed him to get a ton of data from artists. As you can see the majority struggled with mixing, recording, and songwriting. The more we thought about it, the more sense it made to create a course for Hip-Hop and R&B artists and launch it on a new website. We were looking to partner up for a long time, and this was the perfect timing. In the summer of 2017, project Urban Masterclass was born 🎉! We wanted the name to be as self-explanatory and as flexible as possible. And cater to both artists and producers. I guess I've always carried the entrepreneurial bug, but these life events made it crawl out of its cave. In December 2017, Heroic Academy and I parted ways because I wanted to grow Urban Masterclass and focus on freelancing."," if we could start over, we probably would've focused on producers right from the start. Producers are kinda like developers, they actively learn and try to find solutions to their problems. No disrespect to artists, I'm sure there are some that do this too—but it's hard to find them and provide them your solution. Another thing I probably wouldn't offer again is 30-day no questions money-back guarantee. We had quite a few of our customers abuse this. A while ago, we switched to a 14-day money-back guarantee. But if we believe you have purchased the course/product, downloaded or been through all the material and then just ask for a refund, chances are we’ll say no. I wrote quite extensively about this in our knowledge base and I enjoy being as transparent as possible. Actually, a lot of our students praise us for being transparent and honest. ‍"," We officially launched our first masterclass Zero to Radio Ready at the start of 2018 with a brand new sales page. Our initial marketing strategy was to funnel users through Robin's existing website with ads on his site and to promote the masterclass in his email funnels. Those users would hit the sales page and that would trigger retargeting ads on Facebook. This strategy kinda worked as the audience that came from Robin's site were not complete cold and were somewhat familiar with his face. Long story short. We tried a lot of different things and none of them took off. Our biggest roadblock was that we couldn't find a way to get more students. Most Hip-Hop and R&B artists don't necessarily have a place online where they like to hang out. And we didn't have cash in hand for paid acquisition. Here are some the other things we tried for Zero to Radio Ready: Some artists voiced that the pricing was too high. So we started playing with pricing, but not until we charged below $50 did we see a bit of an increase.We tested a monthly subscription plan of $10 but that resulted in a lot of tire kickers. People who'd join, absorb the content and immediately cancel their plan again.We added 30-day money back guarantee which backfired and our refund rate increased.I cold emailed YouTube channels that sell beats and asked if they wanted to be an affiliate. I managed to get a lot of producers on-board as it's a logical up-sell to their audience. But the traffic barely converted.We wrote several blog posts for artists. But came to a conclusion that artists don't Google their struggles as much.We tried an evergreen email funnel with a discount that will expire.Plus much more, trust me. Beyond these issues, we were still paying $99/month for Teachable. And that was something my brain couldn't handle. So I decided to create the course platform myself in WordPress from scratch. For the WordPress geeks out there 🤓... I ditched the page builder and 3rd party theme and decided to use WooCommerce and WooCommerce memberships to handle the transactions and content restriction. For our custom theme, I used the Tonik WordPress Starter Theme and Bedrock for the WordPress boilerplate. I'm using advanced custom fields and two custom post types course/lesson that work together. ‍"," You should definitely check out Urban Masterclass.

264,vacation-bird," My name is Gene Maryushenko and I am an independent growth designer and consultant. I work with SaaS and e-commerce companies to find conversion opportunities and ways to grow their revenue. I’ve spent most of my life living in the United States on the West Coast in California, but I currently reside in Japan with my wife and kids. The bulk of my time is spent on consulting while I build out my info products on the side and explore various SaaS ideas. Currently, I sell two products that are closely related to my consulting - a SaaS swipe file and an e-commerce file. All of my products are focused on helping founders grow their sales and contain strategies to do so. I also started a paid community called Founder Circle that focuses on weekly self-accountability to get founders closer to their goals.  Vacation Bird was my very first attempt at a startup back in late 2011, early 2012.  The name Vacation Bird is a play on the word “Snowbird”. A snowbird is a person who migrates from cold weather to warmer weather typically during the winter months so they don’t have to deal with the cold and snow. The website was a marketplace for finding your vacation rental. Think VRBO or an early version of Airbnb (back before there was an Airbnb).  Our business model, or at least the plan, was to charge for listings once the website became viable and to charge a booking fee for people who book through our website. ‍"," Many months into the daily grind of adding listings I started to question the whole thing. My friend was less and less engaged, at times not doing anything to contribute to “growth”.  My savings started to take a big hit and I did not see any reasonable timeframe that would allow for profits. Had I simply thought about this before starting, it would be apparent very quickly that the whole thing was a foolish idea.  I don’t recall our exact conversation or even the theme of what was said, but we decided to call it quits. In hindsight, I don’t think my friend was ever serious about it as I did most of the listing hunting. That’s not to say that I blame everything on him, the whole thing was a non-starter and we made the mistake of assuming it may go well. I wasted at least 6 months in the process and tens of thousands of dollars, with nothing to show for it. Just talking about it now is very embarrassing, but I hope someone reading this who is about to go down this path takes time to pause and seriously consider what they are doing.  Do I think the business could have been successful? Of course! However, this would require a very different approach. Unfortunately, I was burned out and didn’t want anything to do with it at that point. ‍  Given our situation, I think the main cause of failure was the misalignment of incentives and poor planning. Here is a summary list of where I think things went wrong: Underestimating the amount of work required to build a website with thousands of listings.Undercapitalization. Technically, if money was never an issue we could keep going until the website was populated sufficiently to start generating organic traffic. But in reality, everyone has to make a living and you can’t work for free forever.Working with a friend. There is a very good reason everyone tells you not to work with friends. The big issue is that most people ignore this, thinking they are different because things are going great with their buddies. But, when you face tough times, it becomes difficult to have serious talks without ruining friendships. Focusing on building instead of selling. As I said earlier, we didn’t even need a website to generate traffic to listings. Technically we just needed one or two listings and find ways to get people to book them. This could have been paid ads, referral traffic, SEO, any number of ways. We could have charged per lead and slowly add those listings to our website. The entire approach was focused on building out the site and clearly, that was not the way to go.Working on grand ideas instead of doing something simple. They say when you’re young, go for the big ideas. I say, when you’re young, learn from the mistakes of people who were ahead of you and just avoid being stupid. If you have a grand vision, put in the work researching and understanding what’s involved. The ultimate reason for shutting down was lack of traction and revenue - no visitors to the site, no money coming in for too long. ‍",,,,," Once we had the initial idea, we started an extensive SEO planning session to figure out the best way to lay out the structure of the website for maximum footprint. This wasn’t very hard and we quickly moved on to designing the first version of the website with all the proper URL structuring. ‍ Our plan to overcome the marketplace chicken and egg problem We were facing a classic chicken and egg marketplace problem: you need listings to show to visitors, and you need visitors to book listings.  Luckily, finding listings wasn’t hard on Craigslist. We simply emailed the owners and asked them if it would be alright to list them on our website. Most agreed, but this was not a quick process. In hindsight, I would have asked someone to scrape all the listings and bulk emailed them to see which ones permit us to enable them live. But, since we were both non-technical, we decided to just manually add listings one by one for quality control.  ‍ To get the back-end set up, we hired out a developer that we knew from previous engagements. He had no trouble setting up a great functional backend. This, of course, cost significantly more than having to do it by ourselves if we had the chops.  The process of hiring out a developer, however great the outcome was not without issues. For one, I was not a great project manager at the time and did very little in terms of properly overseeing development time frames and getting a basic version shipped fast. Looking back, making a custom back end was a terrible mistake. We should have simply looked at existing options like WordPress. This would have saved a lot of time and money and allow us to start testing our ideas quickly. The other challenge of building this out was a problem brewing under the radar. Having decided to go into business with my friend was a great mistake, but one I did not realize early on despite everyone saying “never go into business with friends”.  I had no idea what was happening with my friend at the time but noticed a lack of enthusiasm as the work dragged out over months. Despite onboarding some rental property owners, we had a hard time staying enthusiastic. Our monetizing strategy was to first seed the platform with listings, wait for SEO to pick them up, and then use other websites to acquire traffic (while SEO started heating up slowly).  The plan was for most of the money to come from property listers who would eventually see that the website had a lot of activity and the price could be justified by the number of visitors to the site.  This too was a terrible idea. Property owners do not care about your website traffic, they care about bookings. We could have just as easily charged per booking and hustle to drive traffic to their listings. We didn’t even need a website!  For some reason, the obvious solution just didn’t click. All we had to do was make deals with the property owners to get a cut from a booking if it came from us. Then use our affiliate marketing chops to drive traffic to their listings (via our landing pages). Instead, we took the long route that eventually went nowhere.  Building in public was not a thing at the time and we did little in terms of promoting the project. My daily routine was pretty dumb - scour Craigslist and email listers to get their properties on our site. It was a time-consuming process that eventually drained me of all my savings. ‍"," Technically, our business never took off because the entire time we made ZERO revenue. I know… shocking. Looking back at this time I would have slapped the younger me so hard that I’d need to reconsider everything I was doing.  Nonetheless, the main marketing strategy was hoping for SEO to succeed. To get listings I reached out on Craigslist and added them for free. I vastly underestimated the amount of time it would take for SEO to work considering our website had no authority whatsoever. You could say the startup fuel was hopium.  One advantage we had is that people were eager to be listed (well, it was free, duh!). I found that property owners or managers were mostly kind and fun people to talk to. Many understood our mission and were eager to be a part of it. Not being a larger company played to our advantage in terms of communicating with people. ‍ I cannot underscore the gravity of just how bad we did during this time. At our height, we had maybe a max of 200-300 listings. For the organic SEO strategy to work, we’d need thousands of listings on day one to start getting aged in SERPs, assuming we did an amazing job building backlinks to the site."," Before starting Vacation Bird I was spending all of my time on affiliate marketing. I did fairly well promoting other people’s products but you end up on a hamster wheel where the harder you work the more you enrich other people. This made me want to create something of my own. When my promotional methods were killed off completely by the platforms I used to promote, this was the final nail in the coffin and a signal for me to shift to something new. I could have found new ways to stay in the affiliate marketing industry but by that time I had lost all motivation and desire to continue. ‍ Double Trouble At the time, I had a partner in crime - a friend with whom I tagged along for pretty much every new project or endeavor. We’d always scheme together on what to work on next. We were friends from high school and at one-time roommates before going our separate ways.  I don’t know if there were any particular reasons why we thought a vacation rental website would be great other than the fact that once you got it going it could have huge potential. In late 2011, the biggest vacation rental industry players were VRBO and VacationRentals.com.  We poked around to see if there is room for another player and thought we saw an opening. After all, we were both great at SEO and the plan was to get the site SEO’ed out and indexed quickly for organic traffic.  This was not a terrible plan considering we both ran multiple websites in the past that did well with organic SEO traffic. We thought we’d translate that experience into something bigger, more ambitious, and more fun. I had some savings from my previous endeavors in affiliate marketing and decided to take a risk and try something bigger. The only trouble was that both of us were non-technical co-founders which would mean we’d need to hire out development - a costly activity."," If I had to start over today, here are some things I would do differently: I would not start over ) (on this project). Marketplaces are not easy businesses to pull off and you need a lot of capital or other connections to make it happen. Frankly, there are far easier things to work on than a marketplace.But let’s assume we start over. I would not spend a dime on any development. Instead, I would reach into the areas of my expertise and just start sending traffic to a landing page focused on finding cheap vacation rentals. No listings, no website. Once the traffic came in, I’d squeeze it through a search form and show sample listings with the ability to type in a desirable discount %. Once the visitor goes through the form and gives us their information, I would then use THAT information to find desirable properties and reach out to them with a hot lead. The property manager or owner would need to come up with the specified discount to get the lead and I would then charge them for it. In a way, this is just a lead-generating business, but it creates a significant upside - reputation and income. I would then use this interaction to build out a website of trusted and “hand-picked” listings. The property owner would know that I am capable of generating leads so I could start asking them to pay me a monthly fee if necessary. This would generate recurring income all without spending a dime on development. (I had sufficient skills to make basic websites).Then, as I was able to generate more and more leads, I’d start adding these listings to a marketplace website, which would give me a sufficient run rate to keep going without burning out or going broke.I would never partner with a friend. There’s not much to say here other than it’s a huge mistake and rarely works. I would set deadlines for revenue figures and leads generated. If I missed those deadlines I would start looking at possible ways to pivot. If necessary, I would freelance part-time to make up any lost income. I’m not sure why I didn’t do this other than “I was stupid”.I would seek outside critique and advice periodically. I think it is vitally important to get other people to give you honest feedback on your ideas and plans. Had I done this, the entire project would never take off the ground in the shape that it did.  ",, You can find me on Twitter @cogentgene or hanging out in our Founder Circle community. ," I’ve read, listened to, and watched countless numbers of articles, podcasts, and videos. Honestly, I lost track of all the knowledge I’ve accumulated in the process. Some things stuck, some dissipated entirely.  It’s kind of funny when people see “overnight successes” while the entrepreneur in the room knows that it is the years before that lead up to the “success”. Nonetheless, here are some of the memorable resources I enjoyed: MicroConf videos by Rob Walling and Jason Cohen. There are a ton of golden nuggets in most of the videos.The Mom Test book by Rob Fitzpatrick. Mixergy interviewsIndie Hackers communityIndie hackers Twitter in general. There are a ton of great people on Twitter that if you just reach out and ask your questions, they’ll happily answer them for you and point you in the right direction. I think this is the most undervalued “resource” for anyone just getting started or looking for their next startup. By following people you can see their journey, their struggles, what they are doing that’s working and what’s not working - plus you’re building an audience and networking.The YCombinator YouTube channel - has a ton of very useful information. ", I estimate that we spent at least 6 months building out the site and acquiring about 200-300 listings if my memory serves me well. The web development cost at least 10k for the back end. The biggest expense was not earning any income in the process. I probably burned through 60K in savings before realizing the whole thing was a total mess.  Why didn’t I freelance on the side? Who knows. Today I just refer to that period as “the time I was very dumb”. ‍,Travel,Lack of Experience,United States,"April 13, 2021",Gene Maryushenko,https://www.failory.com/interview/vacation-bird,"['https://twitter.com/cogentgene', 'https://www.foundercircle.club/']",failure,0,,"Gene founded VacationBird, a marketplace for finding your vacation rental.

265,vidico," Hi! My name is Michael Pirone and I’m a co-founder at Vidico, a video production agency that works with startups and tech companies like Square, Spotify, and Uber. Vidico is 5-years old now and is moving from startup to scaleup in 2021. I’m 29 years of age and based in Melbourne, Australia  Vidico produces video campaigns and explainer videos for neat tech companies and emerging e-commerce brands. We also work with a lot of Y-Combinator alumni. By the numbers, we’ve earned over 1.2 billion views, so odds are you’ve probably watched one of our videos without realizing it.  ‍ ‍ In addition to being co-founder, I’m the Account Director, which means I lead our business development team in establishing new projects. I have a lot of interesting conversations with startups from seed stage up to late-stage, whether it’s founders, CEOs, marketing managers, or a Head of Brand. Our business model is quite simply fee-for-service, though we do engage in retainer work with some of our closer client relationships. ‍",," Started servicing broad-industry instead of a niche first. Don’t do that — too much competition, and very hard to differentiate unless you have top, top brand expertise. We were OK and could design relatively well, but even that isn’t enough when you're against much larger incumbents.  This isn’t the same as not being horizontally ambitious. You can be that, but you should focus first, get product-market fit, and then repeat with another adjacent market or product. The disadvantage we had was zero relationships with agencies, which feed production companies' work. We weren’t in a position to make the agencies change suppliers, so we had to go direct. Paid ads are hard to get right for B2B that doesn’t offer a self-serve product like SaaS it cost us a fair bit in experimentation. ‍",," We’re profitable, and growing team size 2x YoY since we started. We’ve also seen a lot of startups come through, and have formed many ideas based on all the cool trends we’ve seen. One of these ideas is turning our service knowledge into a product, and that product is going to be called Vidi. I will soon be starting the startup journey again with Vidi, and look forward to applying all my learnings as a co-founder to this project.",," The website went through 5-6 major iterations in the first year and a half. We originally went vertical agonistic, but this was a huge error.  It would have been so much easier if we went all-in on startups from the beginning. Probably would have been two years ahead of when we are now.  Learning: Specialise, and then broaden out only once you have obtained some kind of product-market fit. Classic YC lessons like validate with a small group of users first appear true, and Peter Thiel’s idea of starting with a small concentrated market and then seeing bigger markets as larger concentric circles over time was also very correct for us. I think we had only two clients in the first year, which is not something everyone is prepared to go through. It’s an extremely tough life for the first 1-2 years, and that was with us working 12-14 hours a day on the regular. We ran ads with almost no success. The best way of getting new customers was honestly knowing what they looked like, and reaching out to them with a highly personalized note on why our collaboration would be beneficial whenever we came across them.",," In some ways, startups live or die by their ability to tell their story clearly. And not just their story, but how they provide differentiated value. It’s somewhat of a need when it comes to startup success. It seemed relevant to me if a group of creatives could focus on this particular niche, that there was a business.  Whilst more and more startups were appearing, video was also dominating the online media landscape. It’s truer today than it was five years ago, and I think COVID played its part in accelerating video’s adoption for both businesses and consumers.  Whilst in retrospect we could have been a broader agency and included UI, brand, and the whole works, I’m really glad we specialized in video, as it allowed us to focus on our internal processes in a way that reflected externally through an excellent client experience. I was studying communications and film at RMIT, which is also where the confidence in heading into a video career came from. I was also working at a Mexican restaurant that served great tacos. This was super important, as I’m convinced that there is some kind of advantage to a founder/someone in business development who has worked in hospitality for an extended period you have to think quick, talk quick, and get drilled on the difference between good and terrible service. I wanted to travel more but found that hard to balance with giving a meaningful effort to starting Vidico. I admire people that can do that, but I’m not one of them. My co-founder and brother Evan also studied film and scriptwriting. We always had a love for the movies and got heavily interested in the idea of startups during our last year of university. The idea came from a web-series that we both produced it wasn’t a startup, but it was a project. Learning: start with a project first, and if 3-5 people tell you you’re onto something without tilting their opinion, I’d take particular notice and double down on your efforts. I’m a person that values independence, and also someone that didn’t see themselves fitting well in a corporate environment. I’ve had experiences in previous jobs where people just didn’t want to try ideas if you put them forward. Vidico has grown on the exact opposite foundation our team is part of an environment where if they want to try something new, Evan and I will back it 9 times out of 10.  It’s hard to do this in larger organizations where the decision-making process is too hierarchical and matrixed.  Lastly, there was also disruptive reasoning: I consider the traditional advertising agencies to be heavily overcharging their clients. This meant that a tonne of startups simply couldn’t meaningfully participate in having a high-quality video, and that just didn’t seem right to us. I had an idea for a travel app called Myway, that allowed 1:1 tours with locals. Got the app to the prototyping stage with Evan and the timing was good. But the wider team wasn’t right, and our momentum got stalled with Vidico (then Lunamik) getting traction. Airbnb Experiences then launched some years later, and I watched several startups get high valuations based on the business model. That’s the difference between having a concept and being able to meaningfully execute. All things considered, a travel business would have been a nightmare to run in the COVID era, so it all worked out in the end. Also had an idea called Menyu. Digital and physical menus. Got as far as designing the website, but Vidico got even more traction to the point where it just had to be our only focus. Later Mr.Yum and HungryHungry emerged, which did sort of validate our framing of the problem. "," #1: Be on the axis of not just one, but two exponential growth curves. Ours was video and startups. #2: Make a product so good, people tell others about the experience (aim for high NPS and keep iterating until you obtain it). #3: See the team you build as the company you build. Hire collaborative people, who aren’t necessarily the most experienced, but have the most potential. ‍"," What worked: reaching out to clients that we genuinely wanted to work with. Doing the best job we could for those clients, so they’d work with us again, or tell a friend/colleague. Doing that about 300-times over. What didn’t: offering free videos. No one trusted us at the beginning, even though we honestly were just trying to get a portfolio to show that Evan and I could make high-quality videos.  We worked with some big name clients like Koala and Square, where the work got seen on national TV campaigns in the US and Australia. It pretty much solved the credibility/trust concern each new client had in one-shot. The work was also so widely seen that most new prospects had seen the videos too, which helped. We couldn’t have ever started with these clients, but it would seem you do have to keep working your way up until a very high leverage opportunity presents itself those projects were good examples. For me, it felt validating. If you can do work at that level a few years into your professional career, it felt like I was on the right track, and that there was substance to all the thoughts I had around whether the company was going in the right direction. Revenue has grown steadily, and it’s been reflecting nicely in the size of our team growth (we’re completely bootstrapped). Year 1: Myself and Evan.  Year 2: 1 employee. Year 3: 4 employees. Year 4: 9 employees. Year 5: Will be 23 employees in May. ‍", You can see our work at Vidico.," The tools I recommend are Slack, Notion, Figma, Adobe CC, and Dropbox.

266,viewst," My name is Victoria, and I’m the Founder and CEO of Viewst, a no-code design, and automation tool for everything related to ad production. I’m 37 and I'm a solo founder. Building a global company means constant travel, but I mostly tend to split my time between New York and Moscow. Together with my team, work on Viewst started in November 2019 with the goal being to automate routine tasks in the ad-production process and thereby allow creativity to be unlocked. Despite the core concept being to democratize the design process and let users with any level of design experience create cool images and HTML ads, we were also cognisant of top design professionals spending their precious time on mundane tasks like copy/pasting. With Viewst you can scale your design to as many sizes and formats as needed with a single click you can animate your images without having to code, and you can stream the ads directly to your Facebook, Google, or Shopify accounts. ‍",," Viewst is my second venture and wherever possible I’ve applied my knowledge and experience and thereby avoided some basic operational mistakes. But somehow it still doesn’t get easier! For me, the most difficult aspect is creating the optimal working environment and ensuring that communication is transparent and clear. We faced the new reality of total isolation after just four months of working on Viewst, and the team hadn’t had enough time rehearsing together to perform like a harmonious orchestra. Subtleties were missed, which affected our productivity and resulted in some operational mistakes. Within our team we lacked sufficient expertise to bring the product to the market, build a community of users, and structure and analyze the data. I had to learn a lot in a very short space of time and as a result, made mistakes and was angry with myself and the team. I never communicated my frustrations. In retrospect, I think it set us back several months, and time and again communication issues and transparency are sources of problems. I hired a professional coach and a therapist to help me to overcome my limitations and to improve my interactions with the team. I’m happy to say that this has had a very positive effect – and I believe the team would say the same thing!  ",," We started to monetize Viewst only a month ago with our insane lifetime deal on AppSumo. We earned more than $50k this month, improved the rolling retention rate, which is now above 10%, accelerated our growth, and broke even. Our major short-term goal is to maintain the growth rate and dive deeper into product analytics. We have started to develop an infrastructure to collect and unify all the data from different sources to analyze it and use it as a basis for our marketing and engineering decisions. Viewst is on the radars of large media agencies and brands across the globe, making the team confident that we should be able to reach $1MM ARR in 2021. We would love to hire more team members over the year to be able to invest our time into valuable content and accelerate the shipment of new features. We live in an increasingly digital world where many aspects of our lives are now automated. At Viewst we are driven by the idea that we can bring creative freedom to our users, eliminating routine tasks that are currently time-consuming to accomplish. ‍",," I read Robby Martin’s The Hockey Stick Principles just before we started brainstorming Viewst. It helped me to figure out how to work on the idea and prioritize market research. Initially, I just invited two members of the team to brainstorm and to describe the prototype in words – the product designer who had experience in banner making, and the CTO, who helped us to understand the tech limitations. The second step was to create the product interface in Figma and to describe the logic and the workflow. I also interviewed a lot of our existing clients in different countries about their production pains and wishes, and the major risks stemming from these constraints. As soon as we finished our Viewst Figma mock-up, we again approached our clients, this time with a stress test. Fundamentally, we needed to ensure that our concept was consistent with the solution they imagined and desired. We got more feedback and improved our mock-up, and at that point involved additional people to create a prototype. It took us three months to develop this very first version. It was so simple and imperfect that I felt physically uncomfortable showing it to investors and our first potential users! But I did it as I knew that if it sought to address a real market pain point, early adopters wouldn’t punish us for the user interface but would tell us whether they liked the overall vision. Another book that encouraged me to go out with the prototype as soon as possible was The Lean Startup by Eric Ries. As you can see, with Viewst we have engaged with our users and prospective users from the very first day. This has helped us to navigate our development, be agile, and as a result, build a solution people use and like.",," I dreamt of becoming an entrepreneur while working in Investment Banking, but I had no idea where to start or what to create. Ultimately it was serendipitous. Given my investment experience, friends asked me to help raise funds for their venture. When I had accomplished this, I was invited to join the project and become the COO/CEO. I knew nothing about how to build a start-up I didn’t even know the meaning of the word! But I was inspired by the fact that I would be responsible for all the decisions I made. I used to be a professional tennis player when I was a kid and I see building a company as being remarkably similar. You learn to become a better version of yourself every day, you constantly discover new things and practice a lot, you grind away to overcome obstacles, and face a lot of challenges. On the other hand, there is travel to different places, building new connections, and a great sense of enjoyment and accomplishment. For those reasons I quickly fell in love with my new professional role. I bought a one-way ticket and moved to New York City as it was clear to me that The Big Apple is the capital of advertising and media. The first project I was involved in as a co-founder expanded into three continents in the first year, but it swiftly became obvious that it wasn’t scalable. I was disappointed, frustrated, and despondent as I did not want to return to working for a corporate, having experienced and loved the creative freedom of being a founder. Working on the first project, Profit Button – a new type of rich-media ad solution – we lost contracts because we didn’t have sufficient production capacity. I started to explore this niche and realized that it is a bottleneck for many brands and ad agencies.  That’s how we ended up developing Viewst, a cloud-based solution to scale digital ad production. One of the reasons Profit Button failed was that we didn’t do the research and we developed a technology that didn’t solve a crucial market problem. Viewst is different. Together with the team, we have learned how to talk to our users and prioritize the roadmap, how to save funds on infrastructure, and how to be agile and quickly and easily adapt to market changes. This enabled us to overcome COVID-19 challenges, save the team, and scale Viewst’s user growth. ‍"," I made my biggest mistakes when I was working on my first venture. I honestly think I did everything wrong! But experience is everything and I learned to save money and time, and look after my mental health while working on Viewst. When I was working on Profit Button, I didn’t do proper market research and was building something that users don’t need. I spent a lot of money hiring a big team at the preliminary stages when one needs just two quality engineers. What I didn’t do was invest in my relationships with the co-founders and that was ruinous.  When I became a start-up founder I moved to New York and surrounded myself with other founders, and these interactions have been essential – they are the best way to learn things quickly. I also read many books by rock star founders such as Ben Horowitz, Phil Knight, Richard Branson, Brandon Webb, and others. This convinced me that entrepreneurship is a challenge – it is not an easy path and overall, it’s tough. But it's 100% doable if you are persistent, passionate, and driven by the dream. The Lean Startup, Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility, and The Hard Thing About Hard Things, among other books, offered practical advice and tools. The Y Combinator Startup School also helped me tremendously and I strongly recommend it to all first-time founders. The biggest treasure is the team! I think that founders should hire the best people and learn from them. We are not afraid of mistakes and we do it a lot. I try to encourage each member of the team to take initiative and be creative."," To build a tech start-up you need to invest funds upfront, and it takes months – if not years – to start earning from the solution you develop. Most of the early-stage funding is channeled to product development with little left over to spend on marketing. Viewst was no exception, but that said, spending on advertising before being sure of your product/market fit, isn’t prudent. ‍ We therefore literally reached out to our first potential users in person while simultaneously starting to share updates on our social media channels, like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram. We set up a bunch of analytical tools such as Amplitude, and Google analytics, and used a CRM system to track the results. The first few metrics we concentrated on were DAU (daily active users), WAU (weekly active users), MAU (monthly active users), the retention rate, and the sources of our website traffic. The first wave of interest was fuelled by several articles about Viewst. With this, we realized the power of public relations, but as a rule, we don’t pay for PR, while clearly understanding the importance of being in the spotlight for momentous reasons. The second wave of enthusiasm was fuelled by our launch on Product Hunt, a well-known website that curates a selection of early-stage start-ups’ solutions for tech lovers and other makers. We went live on PH 8 months after our public launch. At that stage, Viewst was still extremely basic and could only solve certain, simple ad-production needs. We didn’t reach our desired audience, but the campaign helped us to spread the word about Viewst and prompted tweets and re-tweets, and several mentions in different communities and media. The third growth wave was thanks to our campaign on AppSumo, the biggest marketplace for early-stage SaaS. This coincided with the team celebrating Viewst’s first anniversary. It was a real turning point that forced us to start building a proper marketing strategy. The AppSumo numbers convinced us that pain points indeed exist, that our users are ready to pay for Viewst to solve this problem, and that they would make use of the service several times a month. I think it’s worth emphasizing that in our first year, all instruments we use to market Viewst were available free and that growth was purely organic. My view is that it is too early to share our experience on building a proper marketing strategy. We are still testing hypotheses, investing in content, and doing our best to create value for our growing community of users. ‍", You can check our website or our YouTube channel with video tutorials.," I think that it has never been easier to launch a tech start-up. These days big companies offer a lot of perks to help ventures to try things and to grow. At Viewst we use perks from Google Cloud Platform, HubSpot, Notion, Miro, Stripe, Sentry, and smaller solutions that cover almost all our infrastructure and operational needs. Most acceleration programs provide these offerings. We got these perks from two different start-up programs: Station F – Founders Program and Aurelia.Ventures Program.  ",,Marketing,,United States,"May 25, 2021",Victoria Duben,https://www.failory.com/interview/viewst,"['https://viewst.com', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2wKpRTFZ01VYQfhE5jsDdA/videos']",success,1,$25k-$100k/mo,"Victoria founded Viewst, a no-code design, and automation tool for everything related to ad production.

267,vimcal," My name is John Li, and I’m the co-founder and CEO of Vimcal. I’m 29, and I’m not based out of anywhere. I’ve been nomading around the last year, working out of Hawaii, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, NYC, and Italy. I plan to move to NYC permanently next spring. Vimcal is the world’s fastest calendar, beautifully designed for people who work remotely and live in their calendars. It comes fully featured with timezone conversion, booking links, keyboard shortcuts, and everything a modern calendar app should have.  ",," The biggest challenge has been that my cofounder and I have very different personalities, working styles, and preferences. We clashed at first after the honeymoon stage was over, but once we were able to get over this, our differences became a considerable advantage. His strengths were my weaknesses and vice versa. Different preferences meant we debated rigorously about every decision. Once we learned to disagree well, we started moving fast and executing better. We could also delegate much better because tasks became something one of us was better at or preferred to do. Other than coaching, one thing that helped a lot was that we promised each other the day we incorporated that we would be friends when it was over no matter what happened.  ",,,," We spent 6 months building the first version of Vimcal before introducing it to the world. Designing and prototyping the product was one of the most fun and creative periods of this entire journey, mainly because we were building a product for ourselves for the first time. Decisions were simple - do we like it, and would we use it? We launched Vimcal in the internal YC forum, and new users found out about us through word-of-mouth. We borrowed a useful tactic from Superhuman: we required a 30-minute onboarding call for every new user. No exceptions.  From January 2020 to October 2021, we onboarded thousands of users. This means we could watch everyone use the product for the first time, tell us in person what they liked and didn’t like, and forge a personal connection with our users. A side effect of this decision is that talking to customers is now a part of our company DNA. Every employee at Vimcal has personally onboarded at least 100 users and has a dedicated on-call time every week to respond to support tickets. As a result, our team is especially good at listening to the user and knowing when to ship something better than what a user asks for. Vimcal works on desktop for GSuite users. We hope to expand to iOS, Outlook, and Android in the future. ",," My co-founder, Mike, and I met in college at Berkeley. We got along immediately and ended up scheduling the same computer science classes every semester to be project partners.  After graduation, we started hacking nights and weekends on interesting ideas while he was at Microsoft and I was at Twitter, which led us to start two companies before Vimcal.  The first was banner ads for augmented reality. App developers could install our SDK into their AR app, and when their users pointed the camera at a wall or floor, there’d be a Coke ad there.  We then pivoted to the fitness space and created an app that helped you improve posture - think Headspace for people who hunch over their computers all day. We consulted yoga gurus, hired instructors to teach foam rolling classes at tech companies, and studied other successful fitness apps to learn about the space. Ultimately, we found that fitness apps required too much marketing for our comfort (and lack of money in the bank). We first came up with the idea for Vimcal while fundraising for the fitness startup. Almost overnight, we started needing to schedule 30+ investor meetings every week. As much as we loved using Calendly, sending just a URL to an investor came off as rude. We had no choice but to coordinate what times we sent to who manually. Mix in Asian and European time zones, and the result was a bunch of embarrassing double bookings, “oops, that time is taken”, and accidental 4 am calls. The tools supposed to help us got in our way, so we decided to pivot and build our own as any maker would do!"," Find the magic moment in your product and show it as early as possible. This can be before the user even gets into the product. Put it on your Twitter page, website, etc. Feel overwhelmed by meetings? If you split your day in two at lunch, you have ten chunks of half-days per week. Pick 2-3 every week as ‘me time’ to do your work and put them on your calendar. Schedule meetings freely in the other blocks but protect these at all costs. I make better, more precise, and quicker decisions after working out. Hate that it’s true, but it is!Experience a lot of different things in your life outside of work. Creative ideas come from seeing the same thing from contrasting points of view.If you’re sending cold emails, include a funny GIF in it! People will respond more and be in a good mood."," We’ve seen significant upticks of signups when people shout us out on Twitter. Productivity tools tend to do best on Twitter since tech/VC Twitter is always searching for the next cool thing. One thing that doubled our retention overnight was sending new users a tutorial email every day for the first few days after signing up for Vimcal. Often, people sign up for a new tool on Friday, close their laptop for the weekend, and on Monday, they’ve already forgotten about it. ", You can check our website and follow me on Twitter.," Tech and business tend to skew left-brained - analytical, logical, black and white. I think it’s important to keep in touch with the fuzzy, subjective part of human nature to hone your gut instinct and be aware of how you feel when making decisions.  I don’t have any specific resources to recommend because this type of stuff is a personal preference. I like to work in different cafes, watch stand-up, read fiction, surf, and learn new languages, on top of consuming business books and podcasts.

268,visualsitemaps," My name is Artur and I’m the CEO and co-founder of VisualSitemaps, a platform that automatically generates beautiful visual sitemaps of any public or private website. I’m currently based in Bariloche, Argentina. Originally born in Ukraine, and grew up in NYC since 1979, where I survived the internet bubble and almost died on 9/11. ‍",," The biggest obstacle was convincing my wife that after one year into it, we should double-down and pursue this startup more aggressively. We had plans to move from a big city to a tiny town in Bariloche as our 7yr old was starting 1st grade and it was an opportunity to start fresh. But she thought it would be more opportune time to take a long pause on the project and recover from our past startup deficits, as the first year was quite time-consuming and I had to sacrifice a lot of my family time. I had to convince her that pausing our momentum = Death. That the momentum we gained from our past year to build was our only asset today to leverage, and that we had to double down on our focus and see where we would net out one year later. Perhaps If I didn't have a co-founder, I could have been open to making that choice, but I also felt compelled to keep my commitment to him as well and follow-through on phase 2 of our product roadmap.I’m really glad I listened to my instinct. 1 year later we doubled our ARR. ‍  Probably not putting enough early focus on content marketing and SEO. But as we had very little resources starting, I felt more compelled to double down on product quality and let that speak for itself. I've also been told by a close advisor that I should have stopped building more features, and switched to 1:1 sales much earlier. About 6-months earlier. But my gut told me to stay on the product as it felt more compelling at the time.  Making the switch is not for the faint of heart as it is so time-consuming and you inevitably lose product-focus. I just felt I couldn't start selling until it was beyond just OK, because for me when you do sales you kind of just have 1 shot in making your first impression, and our target is other high-caliber end-users who were used to seeing mature products..so it felt useless wasting their time until I could knock them out of their seats. ‍",," On the product side, we plan on evolving our UX a lot to make our tool even easier to use while improving data organization and search. We are also looking into a plethora of integrations like GA and other performance, technical audit tools to add more informed data to the crawls. At some point, we may rebrand the platform once we go past just ‘sitemaps’. We've been growing quite well month over month (around 7%), even though the pandemic. We may plan on pursuing a seed round in late 2021. Meanwhile, we have enough runway to get ourselves sorted, with growing MoM traction. ‍",," The best products come from solving your pain-points.  As a +20 year product designer, I wanted to solve my own problem. Every time I had a new web project, I kept having to manually create a visual sitemap for myself and my clients just to get an idea of the scope and page flow. I also had to manually take screenshots of key pages to later use for reference and in my proposals. I looked for a modern solution that would provide the same professional output I was used to making, and there was just nothing out there. So we built it. It took almost 2 years.There are some markets in which consumers demand a lot but are willing to give little in return (by not being constructive, providing feedback, etc). That was, fortunately, not our case. This product is catering to web professionals who are creating other incredible products, so they truly understand and are willing to provide very detailed product feedback when we reach them. And that’s how we were able to quickly validate our ideas and assumptions. The next major break was to confirm the technical feasibility of the automation I had in mind to build the product, so after some deep due-diligence on the state of browser-cloud-crawling technology...it was clear the time was ripe..but there was a key missing piece.  For this startup, I wanted a complimentary talented co-founder & CTO. In previous businesses, I was the solo-founder and I hired developers as I had enough development knowledge to hire and manage them. However, at the time of starting VisualSitemaps, I understand that being a solo-founder would limit me. I was now a dad and I had to better think about my time and energy needs. I was very lucky when I started looking out for a CTO to find that a friend of mine (Luciano Panaro), who I had always kept track of what he was doing, was available. He was one of the few Argentine developers at that time that had got into a forward-thinking technology early on and had stuck with it. Because of that, he got himself into four startups in San Francisco. That made him work at a totally different level than most of the developers that I was working with locally in Argentina. VisualSitemaps was one of these things that required a very experienced and creative CTO, who was not afraid to look at newer technologies and try them, but at the same time, who was mature enough to avoid getting us into technical debt, which would hurt the business as we started to grow. Luciano was a perfect fit. He, fortunately, joined me and has since done an amazing job. One of the challenges we had from the beginning, for example, was that all websites are built with different technologies and so it was difficult to make the tool work on all of the cases. We managed to build a product, anyway, that worked in at least 95% of the cases. As for the business model, we decided to go with a monthly subscription as we thought that businesses that had monthly recurring revenue were the best ones to have. In the beginning, it was very difficult for us to sell a monthly subscription model because when we launched the MVP, it didn't offer enough MoM value at the time. A lot of first adopters saw it as a pay-per-unit 1x sale. So we had to look way past just the sitemap generation feature to validate the long-term recurring model we were aspiring to. ‍",," My NYU background is in digital animation and graphic design. When HTML 1.0 surged in 1995, I jumped into it fast, and within a few weeks, it got me the dubious title of “Mr.Internet” at Doremus, a banking agency in NYC. It was a very exciting time to work in technology. In 2006, after working all over Silicon Alley, I co-launched Design2Dev, an “agile digital agency”, along with a very talented tech partner who at the time was one of the most talented flash devs I’ve ever met. While there, I came up with our first SaaS idea to provide modern portfolio solutions for creative professionals. It was a flash-based application and there was nothing high-end out there at the time, so we thought we could make a decent offering. It took us more than 1.5 years to launch the product. We were both perfectionists and we were always wanting to add more features, instead of releasing something quickly and validate our idea. By the time we launched, Flash was already dying out fast! The timing was horrible and we sadly had to shut down the business. If you can’t beat them .. join them!Having all this Flash know-how helped us figure out a way to opportunistically take advantage of the tech-void Flash left behind. So we built a productized service called ConvertMyFlash, which semi-auto-converted Flash websites into WordPress themes... in just 72 hours. On the outside looked like a fully automated product, but on the backend, it was my agile dev team that performed semi-automated actions to quickly create these custom WP themes. We had decent success for more than a year, and the most important part was that I proved to myself that I could pivot and find success much faster. One year later, I was losing that burst of inspiration. The business was essentially becoming a tedious factory-style process..and our market-window for this service was closing. So this time I decided to jump into a completely different idea..something closer to my heart... ART. This led me to build a social-marketplace called Juicy Canvas, which was a very new way for people to consume art and even design their own lifestyle products (read our manifesto). We got into an accelerator called Startup Chile and had some early success. Sadly two years later, we decided to pivot, as we ran out of runway and there were too many mega-large embedded competitors fighting for the same consumers. The new product we created was called Pop Team and it was an on-demand service we provide to companies who wanted to celebrate their team while sprucing up their boring office decor. This idea had enormous success as we managed to validate it in just 1 week!.This simple solution killed 2 birds at once. It creatively demonstrated that the CEO cared about their team while sprucing up the office/team vibe, matching any decor they had.Our main acquisition channel was mostly email and Instagram which performed really well at a very low cost. Two years later, my cofounder and wife fired me as the CEO and she felt more confident and empowered to run the business her way. It was a smart move, as it made our relationship a lot easier. This liberation gave me enough time to work on new products and my agency, https://Design2Dev.com. While working with clients there, I kept having to create visual sitemaps which took up a lot of my precious time..so we decided to automate this manual process, as it was how VisualSitemaps’ idea came up and the business was born.",," We do marketing on a small personal scale and with the highest quality. For example, we frequently send highly targeted personalized emails or LinkedIn messages to agencies, along with an example of one of their clients’ websites’ visual sitemaps. 99% of the time they don’t need the service immediately, but they might over time, so we try to nurture those relationships through emails and meetings we have with decision-makers of the agencies.

269,vivalatina," Hey there! I am Nicolas Tranchant, a 37-year-old French mechanical Engineer. Before starting my own business, in 2012 I worked in the Aeronautical Industry in France as an Industrial Engineer. However, I had to left everything to follow my Mexican wife to Mexico, where we settled down in Puerto Vallarta, on the Pacific coast. As I had traveled before, I already knew Mexico and spoke Spanish, English, and Portuguese. Back then I had no specific skills in web, coding or marketing. In this scenario, I decided to start an e-commerce, which ended up failing.  "," The main reason for failure was my lack of experience in digital marketing and SEO. I lost a lot of time trying to do it by myself. I should have learned with a great onine course or hire someone to do it. The second reason was that I knew very little about my market, which was really small and full of competitors. In fact, online silver jewelry market in France is much smaller and competitive than gold (or even diamond!) jewelry markets. ‍"," As I have said, my biggest obstacle was the lack of knowledge about digital marketing. Now, I truly believe that my businesses depend 100% on my knowledge. It gives me the vision of what is possible to achieve and how to do it.",,,," In the beginning, I tried to code the e-Commerce site using the OScommerce platform but it was a heck. Too much code to learn and write.  Suddenly, someone hacked my website, so I gave it up and looked for an easier solution. That’s when I found Shopify and decided to give it a try. I completely loved it!  With Shopify, I could get my hands off the code and spend more time designing the shop appearance, editing product images and doing web marketing. However, I still wanted to manage the design and template of the e-Commerce. It ended up being a pure loss of time with really bad results.",," The idea of Vivalatina rose when my Mexican wife moved to France to live with me, in 2010. We wanted to set up an e-Commerce to sell Mexican sterling silver jewelry that we would import from Taxco and resell in France. I had lived a while in Mexico so I had lots of contacts in Taxco to source the jewelry. Moreover, as my wife could not work in France (her medical degree was not approved by French authorities), this was a big opportunity for her to make a living. However, living in France we almost didn't try to turn our idea into a real product as I was very busy with my full-time job, and my wife was trying to work in the health sector while selling Mexican jewelry through eBay. It was when we moved to Mexico in 2012, to a town with no industry and where we didn't know anyone, when I decided to give a try to this business idea we had in France and put all my efforts to succeed with it. At these times, the idea had changed a bit. I wanted to find some local sterling silver providers and make an e-Commerce that would sell Mexican jewelry to France. My selling argument was the low price I could offer. The plan was to run the business alone, doing it all by myself: finding providers, taking pictures, managing the web, and marketing the site. I wanted to cut costs and offer really good prices, as this was my main advantage. ‍"," In fact, I have already started over! 2 years of failure weren't enough. This time, I feel more confident about myself. I have spent a lot of time discovering my market and experimenting with digital marketing. My actual business (which has the same domain) keeps the jewelry concept. But I have completely changed the business model. Here are some things that I have done differently: I bought an expensive Shopify theme that looks very professional.I switched my service from jewelry re-selling to jewelry making.I created a great marketing strategy.I am now targeting clients who are willing to pay expensive custom jewelry designs.I got a CAD software specific for jewelry design. I am now offering custom designs to my clients.I bought a jewelry 3D printer to be able to print my 3D models.I have a long contact list of local jewelers who are willing to design the models requested by my clients in silver and gold.In 2016 I opened my own jewelry workshop in my town. I now have 3 employees.Lastly, a few days ago I launched a new Viva Latina e-Commerce for international orders. It is now only in English. But I am planning to translate it to Spanish in 2019. ‍ This is how the actual website looks like: Our analytics: And a yearly revenue comparison: ‍  I learned that riding alone is much more difficult than with a team. You will lack the help of experienced guys on different topics. I also learned how important is to focus on clients willing to pay expensive products. Everybody is already selling cheap stuff online, so why don’t you try to sell high-quality items with real personalized services? Some people will definitely be happy to be your client. That way, you won’t need so many sales.  "," I focused only on one strategy: Search Engine Optimization. The reason why I didn't carry out any other tactic was that I was far away from my clients and couldn't interact with them personally. I started learning SEO on my own, especially through tries and failures. In 2012 there weren't many online courses, so I started reading blogs and a few books that explained some tactics and concepts about SEO. Growing the e-Commerce that way was a big pain. As you probably know, SEO is slow if you are not an expert. And if you commit many mistakes (as I did) is even worse! It was in spring 2013, when some of my mistakes led my website to get hit by a Panda Penalty, that I decided to get a true formation on SEO and stop losing my time with pure errors. The Panda Penalty forced me to improve the quality of my content, learn more about SEO and clean the website. The positive side of losing a lot of visitors and possible sales? I learned a lot about Search Engine Optimization. ‍"," Well, I am not so active in social media, but you can visit our website here.

270,vo2-sportswear," Hello everyone, I’m Matt Tomkin and I’m currently 35 years old from Bolton, UK. I’ve started a number of businesses over the past 15 years. Some with success and one with a significant failure. I now run a Search Marketing agency in Bolton called Tao Digital Marketing and a start-up called quotonga which helps generate leads and opportunities for businesses.  The significant failure was VO2 Sportswear which provided custom performance sports clothing, such as Triathlon kit, Cycling kit and running kit, to clubs and teams mostly in the UK, but throughout the world.  As well as being the founder of the brand, my role within the team was that of Managing Director and therefore covered the majority of areas.  The main areas of focus for me were in the sales and marketing side of the business. We would generate an inquiry through the website then design a completely bespoke kit range that was always very unique. The kit would then be manufactured to a very high standard in Lithuania (if you have never been, get there it’s a beautiful country).  All of this would be done through our website and enabled us to grow into countries that we didn’t even realize had big Triathlon scenes.  ‍"," I realized the company had issues when we turned over £40k one month then the following month we turned over £550 with big overheads. We were going into the quiet season (winter) too which meant we’d struggle as sales were few and far between.  We took the decision to take the company into liquidation as we were only building more and more debts by this point. It was a really painful experience and one which 3 years down the line I still find very hard to talk about. Looking back the main reasons for failing were:  Not diversifying enough So, on our best days, we were receiving a good level of leads. The problem was this was only in the summer months. If we had moved into even one or two winter sports we would have been able to sustain better revenues through the winter months I believe.    Hiring too soon I was always in a rush to prove something with VO2. This lead to me making rash decisions on “building the team”! Instead of building a good level of cash in the bank before bringing members of staff into the company we employed who we thought would need to be part of the team instead of giving it some time to fall into place a little more.  We started the company using an outsourced function to process smaller orders we made the decision to bring a sales person into the company and this in the end turned out to be a poor choice. It didn’t work out very well at all and meant we’d quadrupled our overheads and didn’t end up getting the boost we expected.  Looking back I wish we had kept the processes as they were (working) and not decided to bring them all in-house.   Not understanding the effect of overtrading  When someone tells you “you need to be careful of overtrading” you need to listen. It was mentioned to me over and over again when we first set the company up. We had an investment team working with us to prepare us for the “big pitch”. I just didn’t believe it was something that could happen. I mean surely if you were selling that much product someone would come in the help fund it right?! Wrong! I spent a number of years not being part of the things I enjoyed after the company closed. Whilst running VO2 I was really lucky to get involved with Help 4 Heroes Team True Spirit we used to manufacture the kit for the whole team but also I made some great friends. My pride stopped me from going and joining in with the team for a good year or so. To anyone that goes through this, just keep talking to people as they will not judge. If anyone does they’re not worth your time."," We grew too fast I’m not sure how you get over this one really. To this day I still feel we were let down by the UK financial sector. We were growing so fast and we just couldn’t get any more from the banks and the investment sector seemed adamant that if it wasn’t a tech business they weren't investing.  One thing I do keep going back to is that we maybe should have pitched the business more as a tech business with clothing manufacturing behind it rather than a clothing brand using a website. It was very ahead of its time so maybe I got my pitch wrong.  Also, we took on a salesperson way too soon. I wanted to grow before we should have and thought we’d catch up on the revenue and profits needed by bringing them on board. We’d worked with an outsourced company for a year before this to process smaller orders and bringing a salesperson in quadrupled the cost of processing sales.  ",,,," So from initially deciding, I’d start the brand to actually finding a factory who could produce the kit I wanted to the standard I expected it took about 12 months.  It’s not easy getting clothing samples organized from all over the world when the only bit of purchasing I’d ever really done was speaking to Telecom networks and manufacturers who were all over the sales process.  In the early stages, there was just me looking for garments that fit the quality I wanted in the product.  Then I partnered up with the design company behind our branding for Comms Consult. The lead designer was very much into the brand and how it could grow, ending up being a shareholder another year down the line.  The beauty of having a graphic designer and not a traditional clothing designer was that he saw the garments as a blank canvas and wasn’t constrained by any previous mindsets of what could and couldn't be done on clothing.  The only resources we used, in the beginning, were photoshop/illustrator and a very basic Wix website that Phil (graphic designer) knocked up.  A close friend of mine who ran a small but rapidly growing digital marketing firm said he would help generate sales leads via Google ads before we got the organic traffic increased.  This was great as it proved the concept to us.  Later on, we used Shopify to power the store for a while before moving 100% to Wordpress and Woocommerce. Wordpress gave us the platform to really push the content growth forward.  We ended up at the top of Google for pretty much any search terms surrounding custom triathlon clothing and near the top for custom cycling kit. Which proved to be the perfect place to find people looking for a new kit for their rapidly expanding clubs or even for wealthy individuals who had deeper pockets than most.  Some of the initial hurdles we encountered were around sizing. One obvious area was the ladies’ kit. It became very clear, very quickly that a size 8 UK standard was completely different from the majority of places people bought their clothing from. So, I later found out that some brands would purposely downsize their women's clothing range so they would come back to that shop rather than be a size 10 in another shop. How bizarre!  We had to look at how we could get people to try the kit on before they placed their order with us. As the clothing was manufactured to a bespoke design and printed into the fabric, there was no way to reuse/resell these if they didn’t fit.   We ended up putting together a “sizing sample” pack which would be sold at a heavy discount. Phil also came up with the idea of marketing some of the other products on the design of the samples. Genius! It meant no-one would nick the kit from the clubs but also helped us to increase sales in other clothing as they were trying the kit on.  Pricing we kept this really straight forward. We had a price list from our supplier for all the kit we sold. We just doubled the price on the majority of kit so we would have a 100% mark-up. Some items of kit we would actually triple the price due to the competition charging a premium for that particular item.  We were making good money on the kit, it was the other areas of the business we didn’t manage that great! All of our sales, in the end, came through the website, we would get referrals from other clubs but no matter where you mapped the sales back to it would stem from initial engagement through the website.  We did a massive amount of promotion for the brand, alongside the search marketing we would sponsor GB triathletes and also became the sponsor to a number of great organizations.  We provided kit to the Help for Heroes Rehabilitation triathlon team called Team True Spirit. I still take part in events with these guys as they’re such a massive inspiration.  As well as providing all the kit to the North West Triathlon junior performance group. This was great for the brand as we were helping youth GB triathletes and were very proud to see some of these go through and make the senior GB teams.   We also sponsored Amy Kilpin she was a GB Age group triathlete who was in marketing so would provide us with a great outlet. She would write for some of the biggest publications within the Triathlon world. Again great to be represented with Amy.  One area I was heavily involved with was the North West Textile association. They had government funding to try and help re-shore a lot of manufacturing that has moved overseas over the last number of decades.  Via this, I was interviewed on BBC News and Channel 4 news around the time the Brexit vote had been announced. They were looking for my views on foreign workers and also how we might be able to bring manufacturing back to the UK. ",," I’m big into my sports and helping out charities raising funds where I can.  A local lads and girls club had a team that were rowing the Atlantic Ocean from Europe to Antigua and I ended up being part of the team.  During the training for the event, we were entered into Ironman UK which is a 1.2-mile open water swim, 112-mile bike ride and then a 26.2-mile marathon run at the end.  Whilst training it became abundantly clear there was no-one catering to the market properly from a design point of view. Every Triathlon suit seemed to be one color and most often they were just black. Pretty boring for a sport which took so much out of you.  I knew of the process of sublimation printing into man-made fabrics so I went about trying to source this in the sports I was constantly training for.  Before I started VO2 Sportswear I had started and grown a very successful business telecommunications company called Comms Consult. It was through the connections I made building this company that the opportunity to row came.  I was always on the hunt for things that mixed my passion for sports, charity, and business together.  The brand was started whilst I was still running the Telecoms company but things took their toll on my relationship with my co-founder and after a falling out we decided to go our separate ways. I then sold my half of that business to him and took on the challenge of growing VO2.  I was only 26, I had a lovely apartment and a brand new 370Z on the drive. Living a pretty cool lifestyle for a young age. In hindsight, I had a lot too young probably as it made me very overconfident in my ability. ‍"," If I started over with VO2, firstly it would be a side project for a good few years while we built up enough traction to pay a full-time salary.  I would outsource everything at first to make sure we had very little fixed overheads.  With regard to online marketing, we’d go all-in on organic search and make sure we became the only place people would find.   Looking back I would worry much less about what people think about you and just make sure you do it your way. I listened to a few too many people at the start who were suggesting things we shouldn’t have done.  "," Everything we did was online, we started using social media to spread the word. We got our first customer/team very quickly. I think some of it was luck and the rest just lots of cool information being shared around Twitter.  At the time of starting VO2, Facebook was also a good platform for spreading the word. At that time the organic visibility of pages was still pretty good before they turned into a full-on pay to play platform.  At first we used Google Ads to gain traffic and sales leads. This helped us build a good level of data on what people searched for and which keywords/phrases converted better.  The main growth happened as soon as we started using Search Engine Marketing. When our SEO kicked in we ended up receiving between 2-5 sales leads per day on our good days, which became the lifeblood of the company.  From my experience, SEO is the way to go when it comes to finding people who are in the market and have an intent to buy.  It can take a good amount of time for organic traffic to start flowing but when it does start to come in as long as you keep investing time and resources then it just gets better and better. Hence why this is the main area of business for me now.  ", My new company is Tao Digital Marketing and also Quotonga. I write a lot about a number of areas including search marketing (obviously) and business in general on my LinkedIn profile. I’m an avid runner and have completed a number of Ironman Triathlons but my proudest and favorite was a run through the Wadi Rum Desert in Jordan in October 2018. ," Here’re some websites: Moz’s Blog: Great information all of the time from Moz.

I remember one that talked about the facebook like button and how it took millions of hours to design just the one button. "," With regards to revenues  Year 1: £6,500 Year 2: £99k Year 3: £250k Then we ran out of cash flow. We managed to gain a small investment of £15k towards the end but in hindsight, this was just scratching the surface of what we needed to raise and I wish to this day I hadn’t taken it.  Put us under massive pressure but the investor was a really nice guy and it ended up not being a very nice situation when he lost it all.  Our overheads ended up at about £13k per month which for a small business was just way too much. The website needed constant investment, the team became a huge drain on money and not bringing enough back in. But all in all, it was the lack of liquid cash that ended everything as we were growing too fast to sustain without serious backing.  By the end of VO2, I had spent almost 4 years working pretty much full time. I even put more than full-time hours in really as I spent a lot of time with clubs and teams we were working with taking part in running events, triathlons and cycling to build vital relationships with potential new clients.  We had managed to build up overheads of about £13k per month in the end with this type of overhead and only averaging £21k per month in sales at a 50% average gross profit margin, the numbers didn’t stack up in our favor.   ",e-Commerce,Lack of Funds,United Kingdom,"November 20, 2019",Matthew Tomkin,https://www.failory.com/interview/vo2-sportswear,"['https://taodigitalmarketing.com', 'https://quotonga.com/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/matttomkindigitalmarketeer/']",failure,0,,"After realizing no triathlon clothing brand was properly catering to the market from a design point of view, Matthew decided to do it himself and started VO2 Sportwear.

271,vulpine," I’m Derric Haynie, 35 years old, based out of Oakland California. I’m now running Ecommercetech.io, a media and events company connecting Ecommerce merchants with the right Ecommerce tech tools. Just a couple years ago, while I was based in San Diego, California, I was running Vulpine Interactive, a social media and advertising agency focused on Facebook and Instagram advertising, creative marketing, and social listening and engagement. I ran the company with my wife and business partner for 4-5 years. We had around 10 clients at peak, and 5 employees underneath us. We did everything from overseeing major campaigns, working with video teams to shoot quality footage we could then use for ads, to creating strategies for responding to rude comments. ‍"," The challenge with an agency is scaling out the services. How do you hire someone to do what you’ve been training yourself to do for years? And then once I have to pay someone to do it, I don’t make nearly as much money as I used to. But I still have to oversee the account, and the employees work, and now I have payroll, and my own internal HR to deal with. We have meetings to discuss things that I just used to do on my own. A 30 minute meeting to get someone to do 1 hour of work… I could just basically do it myself, right? That was the basic problem, actually scaling. Combining that with juggling the execution of services and marketing/sales and getting new business/pipeline. It was quite the nightmare. I remember some months where paying my employees meant I didn’t make any money. And you can only go so long doing that until you go broke. We brought in massive debt, at least $70k, maybe closer to $125k when you include an investment that we took in. And while I think my employees were good at their job and accomplished, the #1 reason we failed was because we didn’t hire the right people. And ironically, I’m not even sure if we could afford to hire the person we needed - which would have been essentially another “me” that could take the accounts completely off my plate from day 1, manage and retain them, and perhaps even work on a largely commission basis. So maybe taking it a step further, we could also say the problem was that we wanted to grow to be a large agency, but we hadn’t really saved the budget and established ourselves as just a 2 person consultancy. Growth as an agency really does require an investment - you hire the employee, train them, can now get more business than before, and then you start to reap the rewards 4-8 months out. All of these issues speak to the fact that we were first time employers, learning the ropes of small business, and even though over the 5 years the company ran, we had a really good grasp on the values of digital marketing and social ads, we were never very keen on business to business relationships, professionalism, and some of the corporate values that we never got having come from a background in poker, and my wife not having much corporate experience either. ‍  Finally, at the end, we had an extremely successful campaign for one of our clients, and yet again, for maybe the 12th time in my career at this point, they were about to pull the cord on the relationship. I flew to Miami to meet with them, and I remember the CEO being very busy, he barely wanted to meet at all. We sat down, he was distracted, which was not unusual, I knew, and he said, “But we can’t tell if this is making us any money.” And I said, “No, we can, and it’s making us a lot,” and I turned my laptop around and showed him the numbers. The numbers from the report I sent him and my point of contact weeks ago said “Hey we are printing money, can we ramp this up?” He had never looked at them… This is certainly a common theme working with clients, sadly. When he saw them, I told him that he may one day want to hire internally for this role and we’d be happy to scale and set that up. He said he wanted me for that job, I threw out a number that I thought was insane, he said yes, and we knew we’d have to move to Miami and shut down the agency to take the job.",,,,," It came from getting our first client. They needed a new website and some local SEO work. We didn’t know exactly what we were doing, to be honest, but we knew we could learn as we went. Some Google searches (thanks Moz) and we were able to really drive a lot of business for them. That started to shape our product offering at the start, but it took a long time to really get it right... We knew early on that we needed to “find a niche.” But knowing this doesn’t make it any easier to actually gain traction in a specific area. Originally we thought we’d do small ad campaigns for local small businesses. Turns out they are really tough to deal with and have small budgets… We originally called the company “Splash - Online Presence Management.” Or SplashOPM for short… But OPM means to many people “Other People’s Money” and that wasn’t really a good name for us. At one point we had this grand vision of opening a brick and mortar “store” where people could walk in, order digital marketing services, and walk out… That never happened and would have been a huge mistake, luckily some early feedback shot that down. From there, we pivoted and rebranding to Vulpine Interactive. We called ourselves a growth marketing agency and we wanted to work with early-stage startups. The problem there is that they often don’t have great product-market fit and everything you are doing for them is a test. And that’s a lot of risk… Finally we honed in on the channels we felt we were best at - social and social ads - and the market we thought we could benefit the most - largely Ecommerce although we never officially niched down all the way into Ecommerce. We stripped away our product offering - we removed Google ads, SEO, and website design/development. In fact, we removed all creative services from being in-house and would rely on additional partners for video and image creatives, only doing the lightest amount of adjusting the content for our dimensions/platforms. One thing we always knew we had to do was provide and prove immense value with all of our clients. We never wanted to be priced overly aggressively, simultaneously, we didn’t always know how much our services were going to cost us internally - ad campaigns are very scalable, but social media customer service is not. It took a while to realize that it wasn’t that we were priced too low, but that we were working with clients that were too small, so we started to increase our minimum monthly rate to $3,000 and then $5,000. Each client has a lot of naturally occurring cost - reporting, meetings, overhead - and you need a healthy minimum retainer to really scale an agency."," Our main growth channel was actually speaking and hosting events. We were able to acquire and grow a Meetup collective to over 12,000 members, and use that to send people to marketing events. We would do in-kind sponsorships of marketing events, handling all social media and advertising, in exchange we would get a booth at the event, and that would often result in business. Other than that, we had 2nd order business. A few of our clients ended up leaving certain companies, which ironically typically meant our arrangement was going to come to an end as well. And when they would land at another company, they would bring us in. So it wasn’t so much referral, like in other agencies, but actually 2nd order business. And the 3rd and most unique to us way we secured business was talking about our competitors and pricing transparently on our website. We ranked #1 for “Digital Marketing Agency San Diego” back when we were nothing and the big companies honestly should have been able to hold that spot. But because we compared our competitors to us, we outranked them. They all shared our content and loved that we sent them leads, and that was fine for us, because every agency works with different types of businesses, and we highlighted when to go to Internet Marketing Inc, or IDEA, or any other agency that would have honestly been a better fit. In that way, we got the right leads for us, and automatically sent out the ones that weren’t a good fit. Now, that being said, we had lots of content fails, like when we thought we should use an online course to get new clients - so I created a course on setting up a Wordpress site, maybe got 4 people to buy it, no clients, and wasted a good 2-3 weeks of my time on that one. And of course, there were some partnerships and events that never really panned out. One event in particular cost us a lot of work and when all was said and done, no one in the audience seemed to be a good fit target client for us, you could tell right at the start of the day too, so 80 hours of work to get the sponsorship and one whole day of “tabling” wasted. The one learning from all this is really understanding who you want to engage with (from a target audience perspective) and making sure you really understand why they would want to engage with you, where they hang out, what problems they have. Of course, this is something a marketing agency is supposed to know really well, but even the best will make mistakes or overlook something. ‍"," Before Vulpine, I was a high stakes poker player, from there I created an educational tech app for a card game and, combined with my degree in Business Management Economics, that is where I learned the ins and outs of digital marketing. The card game app was very niche and never going to be a big success, and while I was doing that, a lot of people started asking me to help them with their website and marketing. Thus the agency was born. I always like to tell people that I started two companies and had a child in the same year, only the child survived... ‍"," I’m an entrepreneur through and through, I can’t work for someone else, but most likely, you can. Start by being the apprentice of someone with more experience than you, learn what they do, learn from their mistakes, maybe get them to pay you money, be their employee. If I had seen inside another agency for 2 years prior to starting my own, I would have been in a much stronger position in so many ways. I did a lot of things right: I read ~150 books in 4 years, attended over 70 events where I both learned and networked, and I listened to all the feedback from those around me. I grew very fast, but started with too little knowledge to really turn it around in time. I do also think I spread myself thin with various side projects, clients that didn’t pay enough, or sponsoring or hosting so many events. A laser focus is more powerful, and being patient with your growth. Instead of aiming for millions, start with thousands, and be happy when you get any tiny victory. ‍",," You can check out the agency here. Here’s our current business, which is a culmination of everything I learned from running an agency and working in Ecommerce and technology."," Firstly, the number one mistake I see people make when learning, is that they aren’t learning what they need to know right now. So what is your biggest problem or weakness? Be sure you know. Secondly, the second biggest mistake is: Not learning from the best. The best information is worth 10x more than second best.

We’re lucky to have a strong support system - family, friends, and investors - and I always knew I could make money in other areas of my life, so for me, I was leveraging as much as I could to pursue this, and because it didn’t work out the way we expected, it slowed our growth (financial wealth as a family) to this day. ‍",Social Media,Mismanagement of Funds,United States,"November 11, 2020",Derric Haynie,https://www.failory.com/interview/vulpine,"['https://vulpineinteractive.agency/', 'http://ecommercetech.io/']",failure,0,,"Derric Haynie is an entrepreneur based in Oakland, California who, years ago, launched Vulpine Interactive, a social media and advertising agency.

272,wantremotejob," I’m a 33 years-old software engineer from Latvia, with vast experience in different projects of all shapes and sizes. I am currently working on my next big venture, which I hope will get to the level of success I’m looking for.  WantRemoteJob was a self-funded startup, which was supposed to help people looking for real remote, permanent job opportunities in IT, rather than working 3-4 days a week remotely and the rest of the time in the office. ‍"," What can I tell, I was a jack of all trades in this project, but I’ve failed to do in-depth market research. I needed to check with every HR and every company publishing remote positions to see if they are truly up to remote work and not just throwing a click bait there for contractors and freelancers. I needed to check it inside out and I didn’t. The joy of making a project and contributing to overall work/life balance (that feeling when you think your project will make a difference) made my focus to be narrow. The business model was fine, the tech was fine, but I had little to no data and my great idea of permanent remote positions and one stop shop in this niche collapsed like a broken dream. The funny part is that I was well aware of the things I needed to do, before diving deep. I knew it’s not enough to have a great idea (everyone has it) and I knew that the business model needs a validation (even if that requires to do a lot of manual work). My wife said, I was too obsessed with building something of value and not just for a paycheck, that everything else just slipped under my radar. ‍"," In terms of challenges, I wouldn’t be the first to say that after the initial joy of starting a project you get into a lot of details, which were covered for you, when you were an employee. It seems like a quick skill to get, but it takes time, patience and effort. It drags your attention await from building project and puts you in a very new and not so friendly territory of being your own boss and business owner. This is the time when you need your friends/family support and they don’t need to tell you what you do right or wrong, all you need is a warming “You will handle this”. Do not underestimate how much you don’t know about running a business, do your homework and read about company types, taxes and what’s required to actually run the business. It the skill that will be paid off for sure and you won’t make it in 2 weeks like I thought it would be.",,,," I’ve built many web projects working for various companies and it was and still is something I do really well. So, there was no big issue to pull it all together from hosting/domain/emails to NodeJS/MySQL running on an AWS cloud with proper logging, monitoring, etc. The only thing I wasn’t good at was the visuals, but that was covered as an outsourced task thanks to Fiverr. All in all, I think it took me 3 month of full time (I was supposed to take a break from the last job) and somewhere mid-2017 it was all ready and shiny to let it out into the big world. In terms of obstacles in the process, I think it was more or less all good, without considering 1 thing that took me almost 3 weeks to deal with. It were those email templates and correct triggers...takes ages to think through, find the right service and configure it without risking to get into SPAM folders on day 1 of running the service. Pricing model was an educated wild guess, based on inner gut feeling and position of the sun relative to earth on a given day. To be true, there was no great thinking behind pricing, simply an excel sheet with P&L projections for 6/12/24 months (I knew how to do it from my previous job). Almost forgot, all the expenses were based on my own savings and there was no plan to get into debt to finish this project, so in that sense, I think I was lucky.",," I guess I can say this project related to my personal situation to some extent. I’ve left my 9 to 5 job and wanted to take a small break to see if I could potentially work remotely with companies/projects I believe in, rather the moving my things from one city/country to another. At a time (it was mid-2017) I saw a niche, which wasn’t quite covered by recruiting agencies and various job listing boards I’ve seen around. It was never a competitor of RemoteOk nor was it similar to Freelancer/Elance portal. The initial plan was to spin it up as a job listing board, where real companies (not agencies) would post an actual remote & permanent position for a small fee of $99 for 30 days. From there it was supposed to be a one stop shop for screening/testing and final offer service to keep it all in one place. It was my first try in business and I was very motivated to make it happen. ‍"," We all learn from mistakes (well some of us do) and my failure from the business point of view actually helped me to learn a lot of things. I know where I felt short and never again will I not check any business idea from all angles before diving deep. No matter what’s the idea you have, test it out. Put on a hat of already a running business, where are your customers, how do you collect payments, what about support, what’re the minimum expenses for running your business. Without a doubt, any plan you will build most likely will change during the execution, but having no plan is the worst thing you can do. Another thing I’ve learned is that once you will get into building business mode there will be a lot of ideas floating in the air and it’s ok to fail. Running a business is a journey, not a destination. ‍"," That’s the part which I’ve underestimated not from a budget perspective... I knew that I could pull in my own contacts and get a word of mouth marketing, but the thing I’ve overestimated was how market/companies are looking at remote work (or at least how they were looking at it back in 2017). For whatever reason, I thought that it would be easy to get the list of remote and permanent positions and I was happy enough to publish them for free initially to get some tracking and traffic. Oh, boy was I wrong...It turned out that a lot of remote positions where only half remote and in the end, companies wanted to get employees into their fancy/shiny/modern and super friendly office. In case if positions were truly remote, a candidate still needed to be on the same time zone as the rest of the team (which makes sense, but in IT nearly every big company has a team working in different time zone). In other words, I had little to no (just around 10-20) remote positions to show on my board and I could not guarantee, that a company HR person would not change their mind and add a restriction making it very hard to pass. In terms of marketing efforts, the good part was my own list of contacts. I knew who would use and benefit from this service. I also knew they would do a word of mouth marketing if it was working out well for them. The rest of efforts to get into search engines and email marketing was pretty much left aside and I don’t regret it, to be true. A list of well-targeted users is 100% better than any AdWords/Facebook campaign for sure! The part I regret about is not creating a social/product buzz to make it more official, it would have improved my chances to build better cooperation models with companies interested in permanent remote positions. ‍"," I’m always open to new connections, so feel free to reach out on LinkedIn."," It’s a funny thing, but I’ve realized that at the very beginning I was reading like crazy, blogs, forums, news portals. I wanted to grab the idea what it’s like to be an entrepreneur. I’ve read so many articles from personal time management to top X list of mistakes...But then it hit me, the reason I was reading all of this is that I wanted to see how other entrepreneurs similar to me are dealing for emotions and challenges they face. They say there is no one size fits all and it’s so true for any business. If you will find yourself reading articles and posts about how to make a business you won’t have much time left to actually make it! ‍"," There was 0 revenue and 5-6K in expenses 30% for setting up a business entity and 70% for building a product that failed. Again, I was very lucky to have personal funds and I knew how and where to save money building the product and the business entity expenses is something you just have to face, nothing new there. One important lesson I’ve learned is that a lot of people say you build and run your project first, then work out business entity and legal.

I’m Primoz Cigler and at the moment I’m taking a flight from the USA back to Slovenia, EU where I live.  Currently, I’m running two WordPress businesses: ProteusThemes and ProteusPay. At ProteusThemes, we’re helping web agencies build beautiful, fast, and mobile-friendly WordPress-powered websites. We create WordPress themes based on a thorough research of various niches which are easy to use and allow the agencies deliver more websites faster. ProteusThemes specializes in WordPress themes for local businesses. The other project is called ProteusPay and it’s an eCommerce integration between WordPress and FastSpring platform. We started using FastSpring ourselves a year ago at ProteusThemes and had to build the integration from scratch. Many people approached me for the solution around that, so we’ve decided to release it as a plugin so every website owner can easily connect the FastSpring to WordPress and start selling digital products without any extra time or money spent on integration, taxes and invoicing. It’s especially valuable for businesses located in Europe or those who are selling to EU. ‍"," Not long after I’ve started buying the links and applying the black hat SEO tactics, the whole BuildMyRank PBN network has been discovered by Google.

I cannot remember if I’ve put it on Flippa or not, but anyway it was worthless without the traffic and the revenue. I didn’t even bother to extend the domain when it was due. I’ve checked out months later that someone else bought it, but didn’t do anything with it really. Surprisingly, I went to check it out again at the time of writing this and waterproofdigitalcamerablog.com is available again. So, if you want to, you can go ahead, buy it and continue where I left off. I can maybe even find the old articles for you on my server if you’d like to start with that :)",,,,," There was no business plan in the true meaning of the word. Everything I’ve started and tried back then somehow emerged from experimenting and doing things I’ve liked and when something gained traction and opportunity to earn some money, I’ve got more motivated and put more focus into that. This kind of approach always worked for me because I started micro businesses because I was interested in something and not because I wanted to get rich. I started blogging about waterproof cameras because I was interested into this and I did my research already anyway (to buy one for myself), so there was just this extra step where I needed to organize my thoughts on the stuff I’ve learned and publish them online. If you’re putting something valuable out there and you’re starting getting the traffic, you can always think about the monetization later on. Consistently getting enough traffic on your site is always one of the hardest things that startups are struggling with. There were two plans how to monetize the site: with the ads (think AdSense) and Amazon affiliate program. But first I had to grow the traffic.",," Waterproof Digital Camera Blog was one of the more successful side-projects I’ve started prior ProteusThemes. Until it wasn’t, as we’ll see a little bit later on. Since I was 13 I was very interested in photography. Then in 2011 I attended the diving school and obtained a scuba diving license. So, I thought maybe I should try and level-up my skills in underwater photography. The underwater housings for the DSLR cameras were way too expensive for me, but a new range of cameras arrived in the market at that time - compact waterproof digital cameras. I started doing some research on which one I’d like to buy and there were no good reviews of these cameras out there back then. None of the online resources focused specifically on waterproof cameras. This is when it clicked in my mind - maybe I should start one? I’ve been freelancing for years at that time so spinning up a new WordPress blog was easy for me. I registered a domain name waterproofdigitalcamerablog.com and started writing “dry” reviews, with all the information I was able to find online about these cameras. I even started a Facebook page back then to start a community around the topic. I was so excited when I started getting visitors and also the Facebook page started getting some organic likes.  The idea was to have the reviews and list of all the waterproof cameras under $1,000 available on the market. ‍"," First and foremost: this was the first and the last time I’ve applied black hat SEO. It’s not worth it, in the long run it doesn’t pay off. Google has an army of the best experts in the world for detecting black hat trickery and it’s only a matter of time when they’ll find you and knock you out of the search results. The second thing I’d do is that I’d select a better name for the blog and more brandable domain name. Years back, there was an advantage of having a domain name with your main keyword inside. Today it looks silly and spammy, so I’d avoid it and come up with anything, but a generic keyword-powered name. ‍  Don’t mess around with Google. There are no shortcuts to success, not in SEO not anywhere else. If something feels too good to be true, it probably is and eventually, you’ll have to pay the debt. In my case, it cost me months of work that went to nothing and I had to stop the project. ‍  If you will be working on the content marketing and SEO, be prepared it will take months before you’ll start seeing the first effects and years before it will eventually pay off. But *it will* pay off only if you are consistent and focus on your readers/users.  More than always when producing new content, plan at least 50% of your time on promoting your content. I learned most of the ways how to do it by following Neil Patel’s Marketing School podcast. ‍"," The SEO was the only traffic channel I was truly aiming for. But there’s that little problem with SEO - it takes months, if not years before it starts getting into effect. The most important aspect of SEO is that you have a high quality, in-depth content. There are hundreds of factors impacting your Google rankings, but none of them will help you as much as having a truly unique and outstanding content. After a few months, Google’s spiders started paying attention and the traffic started to grow. I’ve signed up for the Amazon affiliate program and placed CTA links at the end of the individual camera review articles. I remember that only days after placing the links someone bought the camera on Amazon and I got my first affiliate fee cut. I couldn’t believe it’s happening. It was especially motivating because the cameras I was reviewing were in the $300 - $500 range so I got around $20 from each individual sale. When I’ve started seeing the first sales coming in, I decided to double down on Waterproof Digital Camera Blog. I became impatient and this eventually lead to the failure of the project. The first thing I started doing were the real reviews of the waterproof cameras. I remember it was early summer 2011 and I’ve just obtained my scuba diving license. I wanted to get the real cameras to test them out in the water. I’ve written to several big-name brand representatives who had an office in Ljubljana, if they have models for testing. It turns out that they had cameras who they lent to magazine writers for the reviews. I’ve prepared a pitch how I’m running this successful blog in English and supported it by same numbers. Apparently, this was convincing enough that they were happy to provide me their cameras for a couple of days. In the middle of the summer, I was even allowed to take the camera from Olympus to the 1-week-long scuba diving cruising around Adriatic Sea. From actually having the cameras, I was able to write the hands-on reviews, take sample shots, videos, so the quality of the reviews improved a lot at this stage. From simple 1,000-words dry reviews of the features, they became longer in-depth articles I’ve usually broken down to 6 or 7 subpages (technical overview, design & quality of build, quality of the image, sample shots). The second thing I’ve got this blog into was eventually fatal to the business. Even though the initial SEO results were promising, I became impatient and wanted the results faster. I have discovered that hugely popular blog of networks called BuildMyRank where you were able to buy the backlinks to your site from domains with a good PageRank (yeah, PageRank was the thing back in the days!). ‍"," At the beginning of this year, I’ve started writing a blog in English where I transparently share how I run the business along with the revenue reports and marketing techniques that work.

274,watu," I’m Pablo, a 37-year-old entrepreneur, and programmer, originally from Buenos Aires, but currently based in London, UK after having lived in many different countries. I remember exactly the day when I started coding, it was my 7th birthday. My birthday present was a computer and on those days, they came with manuals with code to copy and play with and that’s what I did when I got bored of the games. Except for a brief interlude in which I tried to be a musician, I coded pretty much my whole life. These days, as a side project, I’m building I’m OK, a little tool to help my friends with isolation, feeling sad, depressed, etc. Watu was an application for temporary staffing agencies. For example, when Samsung needed a lot of people to be at the booths to show their phones during the 2012 Olympics, they hired a temporary staffing agency, which in turn used Watu to define the jobs, the teams, who works when, where, shifts, payroll, reviews, etc. I was the CTO at Watu for the first couple of years. I wrote the first line of code, hired the developers, etc. 2 years later or so I became the CEO when my business partner left. "," I think there are several. My business partner leaving was a blow I couldn’t recover from. That’s the other side of the coin of working on an industry you know nothing about. If the domain knowledge person leaves, you might be in trouble. A big mistake I made, as CTO, was to allow technical debt to grow too much. I hired a great developer, someone who is very efficient but at that point had little regard for technical debt, had little regard for maintainability of the code. We all worked very closely together, so, when the developer said “We could do it in a week, but without tests”, the CEO was happy and would push for that. I should have raised my voice more frequently but it was a hard sell to take 2 weeks to do what a developer was claiming to take only 1 week. When that developer left we grind to a halt. Nobody else could maintain and evolve his code. We tried several times to re-write it, but we always got stuck. I personally never accepted defeat, but one day, the majority of the shareholders told me it was time to stop trying. They used the control of the company to force it into maintenance mode, firing most of the people, reducing costs, and starting generating profit. I was one of the fired. I was very angry at that time, but it was probably the right call. Not because it was the best thing to make out of this company but because I couldn’t personally do better. They gave me an opportunity and I failed. If I was in the same position again, I would try harder to get to know the industry instead of finding another one. My business partner says that one of the reasons we failed is because we didn’t raise money. He said he was scared of the commitment towards an investor. We tried to sell the company several times but to no avail. Only when a competitor started to win customers away from us, we declared the end of the line and made a deal with a competitor. We told them: you can fight us or you can buy us you’ll probably win the fight, but you’ll make more money buying us. They didn’t have the funds to pay us cash for our customer base, so, they bought it in installments for over 2 years. I think it was a deal we all benefited from."," The biggest mistake was to build an application that matched the UK market very well, and other markets not at all. Despite the fact that we had great sales and a great product, we quickly found the UK market was smaller than we expected and that our application was not as useful abroad. This meant our international expansion was a failure. But that’s not all. When we tried to sell the business, a SaaS product with about $20k MRR, and a churn of effectively 0%, we found no buyers. The reason was that American entrepreneurs didn’t want to buy a foreign business and there aren’t enough British entrepreneurs for the market of selling companies to be liquid enough. ",,,," For the first 9 months or so, it was just my business partner and me. I started the project using Ruby on Rails. The project didn’t have anything particularly complex but it was big with lots of, let’s call them, modules. I developed the concept of wide and narrow products when working at Watu. Some products are narrow, like Twitter, while some products are wide, like LinkedIn. In a narrow product, you can polish more while in a wider product you need to tick boxes and move on to the next thing. I don’t think neither is intrinsically better, but knowing what you are doing is important. One problem I ran into was the reliability of server uploads to AWS S3 when hosting the app in Heroku. My solution was to move to our own servers, hosting all the files in a GlusterFS cluster I set up. This was a mistake as it was a maintenance nightmare over the years. The day I turned off I was so relieved. I wish that I tried more workarounds to stay within Heroku and S3. I remember we had the first customer up and running sometimes on month 6 or 7 but it took until the middle of the second year and our first hire for us to have the all-important job module that would allow companies to build jobs, shifts, teams, assign staff, track attendance and feedback. At that point, our value jumped and we started onboarding customers very consistently.",," Any ideas I have tend to be the sort of ideas a software developer can have because that’s who I am. Those tend to have a lot of competition and generally good competition. I wanted to work on those niches that you’ve never heard of. Those can be a gold mine, a consistent gold mine. At the same time Jules, a friend of a friend was searching for a CTO to build his idea. I’ve never met him before, but he pitched Watu to me and I was immediately sold. Before starting Watu, Jules was running several staffing agencies of various kinds and was very well connected and respected in the industry. This ended up being a bit of a challenge because other staffing companies didn’t want to share their private books with us, but eventually, they understood we weren’t trying to steal their customers. He also commissioned various applications built for his own company which gave him experience in what an app like Watu was supposed to do. ‍",," When my business partner was around, that was the marketing strategy. Well… we weren’t really doing marketing, but high touch sales. He was the sort of person that could find customers everywhere. He would go out to buy a pen and come back with a customer. I always appreciated it, especially when I was forced to do it myself. We did have growing organic signups but nothing spectacular. We tried several marketing strategies but it didn’t make a difference in either direction. What always made a difference was Jules doing high-touch sales. Sadly, one day he realized he needed to do something else, he was burned out from working at a startup. It was very abrupt. He told me that either I stayed as CEO or we were closing down the company. I chose to stay. Without him, our growth stagnated. I kept the company going by making sure it was well staffed and maintained. I managed several developers and support staff. I tried for a while to make it grow, we re-launched a new website, did some marketing, but nothing I did really moved the needle. We grew 2x or 3x during that time because the product was good and because our churn was 0%. I’m not kidding. Our churn for the first 3 years or so was literally 0%. Watu was a very sticky product, and once a company started using it, it was very unlikely for them to leave. Most of our churn were companies going out of business. I had a period of trying to pivot the company. I felt a lot of responsibility towards my staff, their jobs, their families. But nothing I tried really worked and eventually, we dialed down the company to the bare minimum, reducing costs, generating profit, and doing profit sharing. We only started to consistently lose customers to a competitor in 2019, about 8 years after we started it and about 4 years after we stopped developing. That’s how good of a business it was. At that point, we approached several of our competitors and we made a deal to sell the company. ‍", Here’s my blog. Pretty much everything I do appears there in one way or another. You can also follow me on Twitter.," I think all entrepreneurs should read The Hard Thing About Hard Things. I re-read that book every year and whenever things get hard. It’s even very entertaining. When it comes to podcasts there are two that I listen to two consistently. One is This Week in Startups which is very aspirational, about changing the world, about making unicorns. The other one is Startups for the Rest of Us which is about bootstrapping, about sustainable entrepreneurship without going all-in for unicorn or death. I think I prefer the bootstrapping model unless I stumble upon a potential unicorn, which is very unlikely. "," We did have revenue. About $20k MRR at the top if I recall correctly. Our expenses were about $4k/month on computers and $1k/month or so on other services, like email, SMS, project management, customer service, etc. We sent millions and millions of emails and SMS. We were almost always breaking even, the rest of the expenses were salaries and taxes. I think overall, Watu probably made a 2x return on the money invested. My business partner was one of the investors and he worked for free while he was working. If we had to add his salary to that equation, Watu probably broke even.

275,wavve," Howdy! 👋🤠  I’m Baird. I’m 33 and based in Charleston, SC. I am a founder at Wavve, Zubtitle, and a founding partner at Lofi Ventures. Most of my day job is running Wavve alongside Nick Fogle & Rob Moore. Wavve is a SaaS product that helps podcasters, musicians, and other audio creators to promote their content on social media. Here are a few examples: ‍ Our business model is typical SaaS. We offer monthly and annual subscriptions that range between $8 and $60 per month. We currently have about 6,000 active subscribers. ",," It’s funny, our biggest disadvantages have almost become some of our biggest advantages.  The disadvantages we started with were our price point, time, and our market. Podcasters generally don’t have much a budget for tools outside of their hosting platform (most podcasters don’t make any revenue). As a result, we had to set our price fairly low to start. We also didn’t have an audience and the podcast market is very fragmenting. This made getting started very slow.  When we started, I had just spent a year with no-pay trying to get our startup off the ground (which failed) and Nick had recently passed the bar (he is a lawyer) and decided to become a software engineer. I didn’t have much money left and Nick had a mountain of student debt. Becoming a lawyer isn’t cheap after all.  These two disadvantages made us build the business slowly while also freelancing on the side. We had to be patient and watch the business grow while constantly re-evaluating whether or not it would be a side project or could become a full time gig.    Our main disadvantages when we got started was a lack of experience and capital and a naivety around building products. We didn’t understand how to properly evaluate a market, do customer discovery, and make fast decisions while attempting to get the business off the ground.  We made a lot of mistakes along the way. Our biggest mistake before Wavve was relying on feature development to drive traction rather than use marketing & transaction to fill our funnel. We fell into the feature fallacy and thought the next big feature would set us on the right course.  We also commonly made the mistake of listening to the loud minority. Say 10 users come in the funnel: 4 would convert and one would be upset. We would listen to that one upset user and let them drive product development rather than listening to the happy 4 customers that paid.  One example of this was all the time we spent supporting social integrations for a small set of very vocal users that wanted to post to social directly from our app when the majority were fine downloading the mp4 video and uploading themselves.  I sometimes think we might have taken too long to pay ourselves. We were so desperate to get the business to a certain revenue point that we never were able to feel the effect of SaaS revenue in our own pockets. I would suggest founders to pay themselves something as soon as possible. ‍",," For the last year, our north star metric has been 1M ARR. It’s a bit arbitrary and alone doesn’t tell the story of a healthy business so we also want to ensure we are keeping our profit margins in the same ballpark they are in now (70% - 80%). We are hoping to hit this by Q3 2020.  Around the same time, we want to find an operator (or team of operators) to come help continue the business forward. At heart, we are creators and at a certain point it will be time for us to transition the project so we can create other things.  We also run another SaaS product called Zubtitle which is growing rapidly and we have a few other concepts we are working on this year under the Lofi Ventures brands.",," We actually built Wavve as an internal marketing tool just before we sold the codebase and IP of the previous company (even with the sale, we were still way in the hole).  We wanted to share audio from our social network on social media but realized very quickly that it isn’t possible to do that. Nick built the initial version of a weekend but it was only used internally. I had to commit images & design specs to Github to update the hard coded templates that were in place. It was a pretty manual process but I was able to navigate it fairly well and use it for social media marketing.  Once we realized the original company wasn’t going to work out, we started creating ‘audiograms’ for podcasters and showing them how it works. We got interested on social media pretty quickly and realized there was a market for this product.  The original web app was built using angular.js, node.js, and mongoDB. We used a few open source libraries including FFMEG to create the animations. The original infrastructure wasn’t extremely efficient as it relied on large EC2 instances behind a load balancer. However, our usage was fairly predictable so we were able to scale it up and down manually as needed.  Getting those first 10/100+ customers was really hard. We relied primarily on direct outreach via cold email and social media messaging to obtain those first customers. Taking the time to reach out directly to customers for a $7/month plan was painful but the insights we gained from those conversations was invaluable. We learned why customers purchased the product and that helped inform our content marketing strategy which started working after about 6 months.  We never did an official launch of any kind. We just pushed the app live and used direct emailing, social media outreach, and constant product development based on feedback. We also learned pretty quickly that podcasters don’t have large budgets (if any), and needed a price point around the $10-20 per month range for this type of product. That meant that we needed to go for a large number of customers to make this a full time gig for us.",," My first job out of college after studying communications was with a large software company in Charleston answering Tier 1 support calls. We supported an enterprise CRM product for non-profits. Then I moved into sales as an early employee at a local startup (also in non-profit tech), so most of my background is in support & sales/marketing.  I was pretty lucky to have opportunities in tech and work with a growing startup to learn skills. The support job taught me how to work with existing customers and how to listen properly to help them solve a problem. As a sales-engineer, I was able to work between the sales & engineering team to help them with demos, scopes, technical evaluations, etc.,  I got married in January 2015 and in February, I told my wife I wanted to quit my job and start a company. It was the first she had heard of this 😬😬 I kept telling her about all my ideas and she finally forced me to meetup with one of her close friend’s husband, Nick, who was also driving his wife crazy. We were both getting the entrepreneurial itch. Our wives got tired of hearing all about our ideas and forced us to go get coffee and talk to each other about them.  We started in 2015 with an attempt to build a new kind of social network. One where you followed radio shows, podcasts, topics, and other subjects and verbally talked with other fans about them instead of typing. Think Reddit crossed with audio & Twitter.  Long story short, we launched the product in 2015. It took on a few different iterations as we pivoted around looking for product market fit. We found it with consumers but never actually built a business around it.  I had already left my job and was working on this full time hoping to raise money, which never happened. Trying to simultaneously bootstrap the product, gain initial traction, and fundraise was really stressful. It felt like we were grasping for straws with any partnership we could find or feature we could build. We lost about 2 years of our time and $30k of my savings (which was most of it).  We held on to the dream way too long. We kept chasing the next feature, the next business model idea, the next big partnership, etc., until we ran out of time & money.  "," The first thing I would tell my former self is to relax. Entrepreneurship is much more of a journey than it is building your first business. I would spend  much time pressuring myself and worrying about making it work that I would cloud my vision when it came to making business decisions.  Instead of forcing that first businesses until the last minute, I wish we would have cut our losses sooner and moved on to the next thing.  I also spent a lot of time early worrying about what people in our startup community would think if I failed. I felt a lot of pressure from that, which was useless. And as it turns out, we did fail and then became a success that no one has heard about.  Cutting the cord on the B2C venture-backed play could have saved us a lot of time and money. We also always knew we didn’t really want to run an investor-backed company but we pressed forward because it was the only option we saw ahead of us at that time. ‍"," When we launched the first version of Wavve we didn’t have an audience and thanks to our failed startup the year before, we didn’t have any funds. The only real resource we had was time (outside of freelancing to pay the bills) so we started with direct sales. Direct sales was a great way to validate the product and ensure that we people would pay for the product. It seems obvious now but podcasting was really starting to hit its stride in 2016 & 17 so we decided early on to double down on podcasters. We built some scraping tools to build a list of podcasters and began reaching out to them personally via email. The results came in slowly but this was a great strategy to test our messaging, pricing, and packaging.  Once we realized our price point was going to fall between the $10-$30 range, we knew we had to find something more scalable. We then started focusing on content marketing through our blog. We started with simple how-to pieces and then graduated to more podcast focused content. Our approach wasn’t very scientific. We simply put ourselves in the shoes of our target customers (podcasters that also have a related business) and wrote content around how to start, launch, and grow a podcast.  Traction has always been slow and linear for us. We never really hit any specific inflection point that made us feel like the business was going to “make it”. Rather, we just keep being consistent with content marketing and social media. With every month of growth, our monthly recurring revenue began to grow We have been lucky in that our product creates shareable social content. This naturally encourages word of mouth growth. Once we noticed this happening, we really doubled down on making sure our product made videos stand out on social media. The more we could get people asking “Wow. How did you make that video?”, the more referrals we would get.  We focused a lot on creating high-quality, custom audio animations. These animations are a staple of our product and while we had competitors, no one has animations quite like ours. Making sure these animations and other video elements stand out from the rest was key.  Revenues growth has always been linear and predictable with consistent month over month growth: We have kept the team lean with only 3 equity partners and a small team of contractors that help with support, marketing, and engineering. Running lean has allowed us to really focus on product development to deliver more features to our customers. Most notably, we were able to complete a massive project for supporting subtitles/captions within Wavve videos. ‍"," You can find our website here.

276,waydev," Hi, I’m Alex (33) and I’m the CEO & Co-founder of Waydev, a Git analytics tool that helps engineering managers gain better visibility into their development team. Waydev focuses on increasing team productivity and helps managers be data-driven.  In the last 12 years, I founded and led several other businesses, most of them related to the eCommerce space. I was the CEO and founder of Copimaj, a digital eCommerce full-service agency, through which we launched several other projects and services for brands. I started my entrepreneurship back in 2007 by building an IT&C online store called LiveMag. Later, I started developing products dedicated to eCommerces as Live2c, an eCommerce platform that helped small, local businesses create online shops integrated with their suppliers. It was the first SaaS eCommerce platform in Romania, my home country. A few years later, I founded StoreBeez, a marketplace platform that led to a 3-months experience at the Birmingham Oxygen Accelerator – an intensive bootcamp for tech startups. Before leaving Romania to the U.K. tech scene I sold two of my previous businesses, LiveMag and Live2C. Upon returning from the UK, I went on and launched an email marketing platform called Lupsale at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2013 San Francisco conference. In 2014, after realizing a gap in the market, I built an accessible ERP (enterprise resource planning) and, one year later, I launched an invoicing app called BillMe.  ",," Wow, there are so many… The hardest part was to find money each month in order to survive We had an angel investor but last year he decided to stop founding us and my job was to find money in order to keep Waydev alive. I did a lot of sacrifices. I moved with my parents and didn’t spend any cent on me for a long period of time. Hopefully, now we’re profitable and we have a very good growth rate. In terms of obstacles, the hardest part was to find valuable engineers with the same values as me, but this is part of any successful startup.   I don’t like to use the word “mistake” because in a startup everything is about keeping the startup alive until you succeed, and any “mistake” is part of the road: the road of keep going until you find a way of making money, because money is the best metric related to a startup success.

Because of this, I've created Waydev, for helping managers like me have better visibility in the development progress. What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)? Code management is now in the cloud on Github, Gitlab, Azure DevOps or Bitbucket. Now it is possible to track the engineering team output. At this moment, most of the technology companies look at reports created with manual input from the engineers, but if an engineer didn’t log the work in the report, it's inefficient and often not accurate. With Waydev we’ve done the mistake of targeting the wrong target, the non-technical managers until the end of 2018 when we switch our target to technical managers and managed to have our first paying customers. We’ve launched the new product in January, and are rapidly iterating based on users feedback. With this change, most of the users started giving us feedback and managed to build features based on their feedback.",," In order to validate our idea, we focus on Product Hunt. We’ve done five launches in about two years, with which we managed to build and better our product and reach our first paying customers. Here’s an overview of the PH launches: ‍ 1st launch - November 2017 ‍ This was our first launch on Product Hunt. It was our first MVP, an app that took the stats directly from the GitHub API. We managed to have some users on the app but we didn't have a database to store the users :) I know... it was a big mess. I remember in the first half an hour after the launch our landing page was down and our engineer didn't respond to the phone... in the end, it was a good test that helped me with the decision of changing the technical team. ‍ 2nd launch - August 2018 ‍ This was the first launch done with my co-founder, Valentin Buzea and a decisive launch for our path. We managed to become the 5th product of the day and receive over 80 negative comments from the engineers because the product was meant to help non-technical managers to better understand the engineers. We didn't realize we were targeting the wrong audience. However, a few months later, without any paying customer, we did realize pivoted from non-technical managers to technical leaders (CTO's, VP's, CIO's and engineering managers). ‍ 3rd launch - January 2019 ‍ This was the decisive launch for our company I remember we managed to finish a big feature on Wednesday and we launched on Friday in order to test if the Product Hunt community would still hate us.  We tagged all the people who had left us negative comments to see what would happen. Fortunately, we managed to have 0 negative comments and also to have a lot of new users who started to use our platform. The old users began to give us valuable feedback, as well, and told us they would upgrade. It took us about on month since this launch until we scored our first paying customer. ‍ 4th launch - May 2019 ‍ Now our company started to grow, and we prepared for our big launch on Product Hunt, a launch with a product with more features and valuable customers. We managed to convince the #1 community member of 2018, Hiten Shah, to hunt us but we failed. We weren’t featured because we didn't have six months since the last launch. It was a black day for us, but we decided to wait another three months. ‍ 5th launch - August 2019 ‍ After 23 months since the first launch on Product Hunt and 29 months since the incorporation, the stars have aligned perfectly to bring us # 1 position of the Product Hunt homepage. It was a celebration of the past 29 months of hard work and sacrifices. This was just the start of Waydev. As a startup, you don’t have too many resources to use and you have only a few silver bullets. Product Hunt was, fortunately, one of those bullets. Nowadays, we’re writing valuable content on our blog (one blog / week) and cold-reaching engineering managers in order to motivate them to try our product. We’re growing +40% month over month in terms of revenue, and we also have a retention of over 40% on an 8 week period.", Check out my blog posts on Hackernoon and Waydev blog.

277,wedmap," Hey guys, I’m Tauras, 30 years old entrepreneur originally from Lithuania, but based in Switzerland. During my entrepreneurial journey, I have founded multiple startups and my full focus at the moment is on 21 Day Hero - an online marketplace for 21 Day Challenges that are designed to help you lose weight, improve your fitness and reduce stress, by changing your habits. While I’ve enjoyed my fair share of failures, the most notable is probably the one at Wedmap, a startup that aimed to digitize the wedding planning process. I’ve found it together with 2 other guys and we ran it for almost 3 years before deciding to pull the plug.  Whoever had to play a role in planning a wedding, knows that it is full of inefficiencies and it lures entrepreneurs in every market to come up with the solutions. Our thinking was simple - in the age of Airbnb, gig-economy, and sharing-economy, people are so used to finding and booking the services online, that it's only a matter of time until you can find and book ALL of the services needed for your wedding - completely online. Thus ultimately, we aimed to be an online marketplace for wedding locations and service providers, using a usual marketplace business model - taking a % of the booking amount. "," Oh boy, where do I start…:) As all of you know, there is never one reason for failure. A certain combination of timing, skills and resources can take you to the top, but a wrong mixture will slowly burn you down.  Team Let’s start with the most crucial part of any startup - team. We were 3 men working in a market driven by women. We knew that, but thought that it didn’t really matter. In the hindsight, I’m sure a lot of our potential clients went somewhere else, because of the lack of feminine touch in our product and communication. On the other hand, me and Gian had skills that were too overlapping. We both had experience and wanted to play a role in business development, product, marketing, sales & design. Up till the very end our egos were in the way, preventing the ability to trust one of us with the CEO title. We both wanted to be in charge. It was childish, but once again - it was a reality and it created another hurdle towards making WedMap successful.  Resources We definitely didn’t have a lot of spare cash to invest. Living in Switzerland without an income, will burn through your savings quicker than you can imagine. We were always under the intense pressure to succeed NOW, max next month. We kept buying time from our better-halves, promising them that it’s just a few more months until we launch this great new feature people were waiting for. Nobody was actually waiting, but the lies you tell yourself and others to keep that wishful thinking going... Also, we aimed to be a software-startup, but Pawel, our third co-founder was the only engineer. He was building this huge product we wanted WedMap to become. Looking back - we could have used his skills much better, but we didn’t understand this at that time. On the bright side, we were hustlers and super scrappy when it came to getting stuff for free.  I’m sure we were able to last so long with no income because we were smart (sort of) in where we spent the little cash we had...  Skills While we thought that we had all of the skills we needed to succeed, the truth is, we were too cocky. We were more interested in playing entrepreneurs than actually doing the things entrepreneurs should really do.  We didn’t lack determination, but we had little experience in product development, building a two-sided marketplace, generating 1000s of visitors cheaply and doing sales in this new market. Nevertheless, I’m so happy we just went for it - it made me the much better entrepreneur that I am now (still a long way to go, though).  Product As mentioned before, we got lost in product development. We didn’t speak to enough users before deciding on what to build, didn’t go deep enough to understand what it is people would really pay for and for some reason we were thinking it’s a great idea to invest all this time in building a sport-car before building a great bike first. ‍ -- We stopped working on WedMap in June 2018, but we didn’t shut down the company until the end of 2018. A stripped down version of it is still online, but it’s only a 2% version of what WedMap was at its peak. As you can see, the shutdown process was gradual, it took us at least a year after we stopped working on it actively to fully pull the plug. I guess the attachment to our ‘baby’ was too strong. At least for me, I couldn’t face the failure right away and wanted to keep the door open to supply us with a false hope of someone wanting to buy it. Admitting to failure is so, so hard. What happened after June 2018, I have written extensively about in my blog post “How my failed startup made me the healthiest version of myself”. ‍"," I’ve talked about it quite extensively in the previous question, but to summarize I’d point out the 3 biggest mistakes: ‍1. Failing to utilize off-the-shelf tools to get product-market-fit Knowing what I know now, we could have built 80% of WedMap with 20% of time-spent, simply using Wordpress Themes for marketplaces and a bit of custom coding, that our co-founder was more than capable to do. It would have saved us at least 6 months of time. 6 months...I’ll leave you with that thought.  2. Not talking to our customers and thinking we know what the market needs You heard this one 100s of times already. Why? Because it’s true. It takes a certain level of naivety and arrogance to THINK you know what your market needs. Please note that the majority of our market was the opposite sex. We all know that men can’t know what women need :) Jokes apart - it took us 1.5 years to really start talking to our customers. And even then, we were simply looking for affirmations to our ideas and ignored the red flags.  3. Not being ready for a marathon During the last 6-8 months of WedMap, we were exhausted from encountering problematic hiccups and reacting to them by desperately looking for quick-fixes, quick wins. We started to engage in multiple side-projects looking for any revenue streams. Our bank accounts were empty and arguments at home were more frequent - it’s an immense pressure to experience and I wish everyone to be in that place at least once. Our response to that situation was bad, because when starting WedMap, we had high expectations that everything would work out within the first 6-12 months. Ridiculous when I think about it now, but it only shows that we were not ready to look at WedMap as a marathon and not a sprint. That mentality led us to a series of really bad decisions.",,,," We built our first prototype in a month and launched it right away. Initially, we intended to list all the wedding locations and vendors on the map (hence the name WedMap), using the Google Maps API and a custom front-end. It was built from scratch by our CTO Pawel and designed by my co-founder Gian. It was simple and beautiful. But then, we got lost in the perpetual product development, wrongly thinking that MORE is what we need. We quickly realized that the Google Maps API was a limiting factor and after adding more than 100 map pins with infoboxes, the site was loading extremely slow. Thus for the next 6 months, we rebuilt WedMap to look similar to Airbnb. We had a full-featured backend for both, engaged couples and wedding vendors. But everything was buggy, not fully mobile responsive and slow. Pawel was our only engineer. He had only 2 hands and 12h in a day. On top of that, we made a mistake of thinking about having a ‘scalable’ platform right away instead of using more off-the-shelf tools like Wordpress + Themes + Plugins. Our business model changed a couple of times too - from a listing model, to lead generation, to revenue sharing. It’s a whole different story, that perhaps needs another full blog post.  But what was great is that we really enjoyed the whole process. We were optimistic, happy to work hard and really wanted WedMap to succeed. And we were happy to talk about WedMap everywhere we went - we basically flooded the Swiss startup scene with our pitches in every single event we could go to, which in the hindsight, perhaps was also a sign of not having a focus in the right place... ",," I was involved quite heavily in planning my own wedding and as an entrepreneur, I couldn’t understand - why is information so scattered, hard to find and moreover, why in 2015 (at the time) everything is so offline? Seeing a market opportunity, I talked to a couple of friends, Gian and Pawel and convinced them, that it’s our chance to build something great. Did we have prior experience in building successful tech startups? No. Did we have any experience doing business within the wedding market as non-consumers? Nope. Did we realize how important it is to talk to your users, before building the whole set of features? Not really. Did we have any clue about the challenges of a 2-sided marketplace? We had no clue. But that’s the whole beauty of it - we just went for it and learned stuff the hard way. ‍"," It relates a lot to the biggest mistakes I mentioned previously. I’d say to myself - make sure you really talk to your customers, make sure you find ways to put your product out there and find out what people are ready to pay for as soon as possible. And finally - if you’re not really ready for this to be at least 3-5 years of ups and downs - don’t do it. "," I was the marketing guy at WedMap and I have to admit - I did a lousy job. We tried many things, but none of them really well. Social Media, Email Marketing, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, SEO… We knew all the right tools, but lacked having the right priorities, which hindered our marketing efforts and we made a usual mistake unexperienced founders do - focused too much on the product, thinking that it will sell by itself. We had some success with Facebook ads as our customer LTV was pretty decent and could offset the CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost). But our sales processes were not optimized, took a lot of manpower and sometimes we got too many leads, sometimes not enough. Looking back, I would have had much more success if I better focused on SEO as our competitors were not doing a very good job with it and we could have generated so much needed traffic, with very reasonable costs. But we wanted results now and SEO was too long-term. Ads were expensive but it brought traffic now. Sounds silly, I know, but that was the reality. One highlight though, I was reading a book titled ‘Traction’ by Gabriel Weinberg. It gave us the structure in our marketing strategy we needed. For a while at least... ‍"," If you want to improve your mental or physical health - go on and try one of our amazing 21-Day Challenges here. If you need to boost your SEO - reach out to my agency. If you’re interested to follow me on Social Media, let’s connect on LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram or Medium."," In terms of websites, I really enjoy this one and this one. I also like the well-known books Traction, by Gabriel Weinberg, and Hooked, by Nir Eyal. I also usually listen to podcasts like Smart Passive Income by Pat Flynn, Marketing School with Neil Patel & Eric Siu, Entrepreneurs On Fire by John Lee Dumas and many more... In terms of tools, I generally use Wordpress + Elementor (great for prototyping), MailerLite (great for email automation) and Envato Elements (great for various licensed media assets for an affordable price). ‍"," We always kept our expenses low. Perhaps the biggest month was around $2k when we were making a bit of cash. We never paid ourselves, so our expenses were related to software tools, hosting, paid ads, and participation in wedding exhibitions. We had a bunch of unpaid interns, although we did try our best to pay them at least a little when we had a chance. Our revenue in the first year was around $4k, around $10k in the second year, and around $20k in the third year. Expenses were practically the same as we always invested everything back. So, we didn’t lose a lot of money if you look at the balance sheet, but opportunity costs were extremely high. All three of us left $100k+ job opportunities behind to pursue WedMap full time. Plus, we were burning at least $4k/month on living expenses (told you living in Switzerland is expensive)! ‍",Software & Hardware,Lack of Funds,Switzerland,"May 31, 2019",Tauras Sinkus,https://www.failory.com/interview/wedmap,"['http://21dayhero.com', 'http://sinkusstudio.ch', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/taurassinkus/', 'https://twitter.com/SinTauras', 'https://www.instagram.com/sintauras/', 'https://medium.com/@tauras.sinkus']",failure,0,,"Tauras is a 30-year old entrepreneur from Lithuania.

278,woovly," ‍I am Neha Suyal, and I am changing the way small towns and cities of India discover fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products. Woovly, based in Bangalore, India, is my first entrepreneurial venture. It is India’s leading social commerce platform for fashion, beauty, personal care, and lifestyle products that help customers to shop via AI-driven brand-tagged user-generated content.  As a qualified Computer Science engineer, I have extensive experience building open-source technologies. I left a well-paying job with HP India in 2015 to join the Stanford Ignite program on Entrepreneurship and Leadership, where I met J. Venkat, my co-founder. After completing the program, I went on to work with Quess Corp., Venkat’s earlier venture, to understand the business and improve its business metrics. After working on various Telecom and managed services projects for two years at Quess, I decided to take the plunge as an entrepreneur in 2017 and finally founded Woovly, an adventure experience platform with Venkat in 2019. In 2020, during the pandemic, Woovly pivoted to social commerce for lifestyle products.  ‍",," Though our business was in a healthy state and we were growing, when Covid hit, we as founders had to take a call on our future. Though it was an unforeseen challenge, we took it positively. Our approach was to work with our core principles and business premise, yet transform to stay relevant and maintain our growth. This move has held us in good stead as we saw 600% growth in our user base in the next 18 months. The other challenge that I personally, as a women entrepreneur, faced was the unconscious bias around. There are skeptics everywhere - including family, friends, and even peers. Especially because I hail from a small town (Tier III in India), when I quit my job to start my own venture, no one agreed with my decision. It was considered too risky as I was expected to go the conventional route of holding on to a typical day job. However, with Woovly growing rapidly and setting new benchmarks, I am happy to note that young women find my journey inspirational to start their ventures.   While scaling up, we needed a lot of skilled resources and that’s where I think I fumbled. When the ask was to hire fast, I took a lot of time to hire new talent. When new hires did not perform, I waited too long to let them go, giving them multiple opportunities to come up the curve. In some ways, the slow learners and poor performers slowed down our growth. But very soon, it made me realize that it wasn’t the ideal way to grow. I learned to keep my emotions aside and take tough decisions when necessary.   Another disadvantage we faced was that we were in unchartered territory. Since social commerce as a concept is still in its early phase in India, we had no benchmarks or standards to measure against. There was nobody to share insights into the industry and we just experimented and built as we progressed.  ‍",," In the near term, we aim to grow the number of D2C brands featured on our platform by 400% and expand to 4 categories to bring lifestyle products to our users. India is a country of diverse languages, and we aim to reach out to our users in their own language, i.e., vernacular languages. As per our research, our target audience makes close to Rs. 25000 every month. We hope that by the end of the year, each content creator on the Woovly platform will be able to supplement their income by at least Rs. 12000 per month, on average. This is about 50% of their average monthly income and would help them fulfill their ambition to have a better lifestyle. Our target is to capture 15% of the $100B social commerce market in the next 5 years. Through the Woovly Creator Academy, we hope to train more young girls across Tier II and Tier III cities so that they can prepare and shoot video content. They can become micro and nano influencers and when they create content and build their community as micro and nano influencers, they get the opportunity to earn a livelihood or supplement their income through incentives on our platform.  ‍",," During my trips to various Tier II and Tier III towns while working with Quess, I discovered that the youth living there were hard-working and ambitious and wanted to consume lifestyle products too. This made me realize this segment's consumption behavior, which ultimately laid the foundation of Woovly. I quit Quess in 2017, and Venkat joined me in 2019. We started Woovly as an adventure experience platform but pivoted to social commerce for fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products during the pandemic.  Our biggest challenge came in early 2020. When the pandemic struck, we had just started getting heavy traction and had over a million users. But travel came to a standstill, and we had to think on our feet to transform ourselves. Our experience with making the perfect blend of content, community, and commerce came in handy and we decided to serve it as a unified experience on our app this time with fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products.",," I studied Computer Science Engineering at a Regional Engineering College in Uttarakhand and built my career and expertise at HP, working on open-source technologies. I never had to look far for an idol. 35 years ago, my mother founded the only school in my hometown and continues to run it today. I draw inspiration from my mother’s undying spirit to take on challenges and overcome all odds to fulfill her dreams. In 2015, I met my co-founder at Stanford, and the idea of Woovly was seeded. We discovered we had a shared interest in studying and predicting consumer buying behavior and our belief that buyers were increasingly tending towards discovering products and brands online rather than offline.  After the short-term program, I returned to India and worked for two years at Quess Corp. As a part of my responsibilities, I traveled extensively across small towns and cities termed the Tier II and Tier III cities in India and realized that the young population had aspirations to achieve the lifestyle of their peers in Urban India or the Tier I cities. I recognized a latent need for a platform that would allow them to fulfill their ambitions. Later on, when we finally decided to go down the entrepreneurial path, this learning and our faith in online brand discovery led us to social commerce and Woovly. ‍"," Building Woovly has been exciting and enjoyable. I look back at my journey as an immense learning experience. Every obstacle, disadvantage, and challenge have taught me new lessons and I have treated them as learning opportunities. So, there is nothing I would want to do differently.  ‍"," When we started building our business, we were very clear that we did not want to go the social media advertisements route for promotions. We devised our own growth hack since we wanted to grow organically. For the first 1000 users, we directly reached out, spoke to them, and shared the value proposition. We aimed to make them our ambassadors or brand loyalists who could advocate our brand to their communities. They, in turn, reached out to college students who wanted to be influencers and content creators and brought them on board. As we began to grow, we also tied up with placements cells of Management Colleges and picked students who wanted to become content creators. Over time, we tied up with 1000 such colleges and 10,000 students. This had a powerful network effect and we were able to make our mark among youngsters organically without spending our resources on costly advertisement campaigns. They became micro and nano influencers with their own groups of followers and we had our community of advocates and loyalists. It was our greatest and most successful marketing strategy. To date, 72% of our users have been acquired organically i.e., through word of mouth. 61% of our revenue is from these micro and nano influencers. ‍"," You can learn more from our website, app and my LinkedIn profile."," I am an avid reader and love to read on diverse topics related to business, entrepreneurship, and consumer behavior.

281,wura," I’m Mike, 28 years old based in Atlanta GA. I was born and raised in Lagos Nigeria, moved to the US when I was 12 years old and I fell in love with the computer from an early age. I started simple coding in High school and that would later lead to my career now as a web developer/ internet entrepreneur. WURA started as a pet project, and for 2 years it really was that. My family and I loved to watch our native African/Nollywood movies and we generally had access to those movies on YouTube, except they were all over the place. You had to search and dig through the dirt to find a good quality movie. WURA was a way for me to curate a playlist of titles so to speak. It was an on-demand video platform we one came and built their own playlist of high-quality titles that were readily available. It wasn’t until I had some cash in the bank though that I started thinking about the project more like a business. My other businesses took off and I had the capital to turn it into a legitimate business. And that I did, hired a team of 10 with myself included. And we put together a nice platform to watch movies on your pc and mobile devices. For a monthly fee of $3.99, a user had access to hundreds of new titles (movies and TV shows) both in English and other local dialects. My main task was to oversee everything. I was the owner but I was also part of a team of 9 other incredible people. ‍"," The main cause of failure for WURA was YouTube. Probably with some mistakes and carelessness on my part as well, but YouTube was the ultimate giant that rendered the business model unsustainable. Sadly, I didn’t realize this fact until much later on. Remember when I said that I thought there was a big opportunity once I found out IROKO TV raised $8 million? Apparently, hundreds of others thought the same, particularly the movie producers. So, the same guys we paid a fee to license their contents went behind our backs and flooded YouTube with the same titles and much more. This basically erased whatever monetary value the movie titles had. I considered WURA more of a service than just a movie or video site. But it is extremely hard to sell that service to anyone if their ultimate goal is to watch a movie and that movie is already available somewhere else for free. And not just somewhere else, but YouTube, which was and still is the most recognized name in online videos. That said I had some responsibility for the failure of WURA as well. For one, I focused way too much on the product itself, that I misjudged the market. And in focusing on the product, I made way too may alterations and customizations. I also licensed way too many more titles than I should have. My marketing strategy was backward. I should have had a marketing plan and execution in place before even launching the product. I’d assumed that guys like Iroko had already proven the concept that I just need to gain some of that market share. Wrong! When it was all said and done, I started to realize that the business may not hold due to the trend I was seeing on YouTube, literally every day I would see a new channel pop up showing the same titles that we carry. Although ours were in much greater quality and high definition, still didn’t matter. I naively stayed in the game and hoped for a different outcome or tried a different approach at may be changing the type of content we carried, but even if that were to be successful, I was already running out of cash by this point. Ultimately, I let everyone go and shut down once I ran out of my entire life savings. And for a while there I still left the site online and gained new users daily. I recently just completely shut down the site/server and many of the online social pages. It took about 2 years for me to get there shut down completely. That’s the emotional attachment and pain many of us entrepreneurs deal with. But sometimes you just have to let go."," I wouldn’t say there was a particular BIG mistake or mistakes. I think I had a lot of small things that added up and here I’ll list them. I went too fast and should have taken more time.Should have vetted producers and movie titles much better. Looking back, I spent 3-4 times more than I should have spent on licensing.I moved from New York to California. This was actually one of my biggest mistakes. I had a track record and a stable group of people and connection in NY that would have helped me grow even further. Moving to Los Angeles California, I knew no one and emotional that was bad. Also, California is not business friendly. I paid so much in fees and taxes that I swore to never go back there.I had no exit strategy. As someone who is extremely passionate about what they’re doing, this is the last advice I would give anyone. But having gone through my experience with WURA, I believe that if you’re going to build anything that will cost you north of $100,000, best to have an exit plan. And that could be knowing when to stop or stopping after you’ve invested X amount of dollars of your own money. ‍",,,," Again, when I first started, it was more of a side project because of my current situation at the time. I had to work a fulltime consulting job. But while I could, I initially set up a WordPress website and I remember using the WordPress theme ‘detube’. I made a list of features I wanted to add to the site to make it more usable and easier for users to find titles or build their own playlist. I played around with it by myself for a few months, and then towards the end of the year (2013), I was able to find a buyer to liquidate what was left of my gaming business. I got about $49,000 from that sale, and with the additional income from my day job, I felt I had enough to get serious about WURA. So, I did, and the first person I hired was a PHP programmer/coder, and we started adding that list of features to the site. Then I began reaching out to Nollywood producers and movie makers to acquire titles for a licensing fee Some of the major obstacles I faced were dealing with the West African business ecosystem, also having to transact with people thousands of miles away came with its own challenges. Sometimes hard drives would get lost in shipment or sometimes I get the hard drives and it has the wrong content in it. And this wasn’t something you can just drive to the store and return. It would cost $100-$150 to ship hard drives back and forth. And internet connection there, is not strong enough to send very large files through the cloud. So, to reduce risks, I had producers send me hard drives first that contained several movies. Then from there, we chose 3-5 titles that we really wanted. Over time, that saved a lot of money and headache At the time I was building WURA, I also had a successful entertainment blog that brought in enough revenue for me to continue funding the project. I went on to hire a team of 9 people, designers, writers, editor etc. and my programmer was also brought in full time. Hired a mobile developer as well. So, I had a legitimate business. Had the people, invested thousands in acquiring new titles. All was left was launching and executing with the right marketing plan. Or so I thought.",," When I started WURA in 2013, I was actually just recovering from a failed startup the year before. My background is in web development but I consider myself more as a project manager as I rarely get hands-on anymore with my projects. Between 2008 and 2012 I was in the flash gaming business and I ran a successful network of gaming websites, up until early 2012. Several events happened that year that shut down about 80% of my business. First was Google Panda update or Penguin, whichever it was, I lost my Search engine rankings and that alone completely decapitated my business. Also, by this time smartphones had already taken over the market so many gamers that would typically come on the site to play games now go to their mobile phones. And in my efforts to transition to mobile games and join the trend, I essentially lost about $21,000 to a sham game developer on Elance (be very careful when using freelancers for big projects). Long story short, by the time the year was over, I went from making $75k a year to barely making ends meet. I shut down the servers, sold my car, cleaned out my apartment, and moved back in with my parents. As an entrepreneur, your best insurance policy is mom and dad because when things go south (and they will at some point) you at least have a place to lay your head and try to recoup. And so, it was a few months after living on my parent 's couch that the idea of WURA came about. When you live on the couch, you tend to consume a lot of TV and online videos. At least that was the case for me. When I kept watching these movies on YouTube, that’s when the idea came to me. Also, it helped that I saw another person (IROKO TV) running with the same Idea. Later that year Iroko went on to raise $8 million. And I thought for sure there is a big opportunity here. ‍"," There are a few things: I focused too much on the product and didn’t pay much attention to the market.My Marketing strategy should have come before product launch.Facebook was not the right platform to use as primary advertisingI had way too much money. Looking back, I wish I didn’t have as much money to spend because I would have been much more disciplined with my execution and not invest in useless things. I actually made a video discussing this here.Doing business with Nigerians can be a headache. And it’s not because of the people you’re doing business with, it’s the infrastructure there. Simple transactions to send and receive money can be a mile walk.I made some business decisions based on gut feeling rather than use facts and research. Those later came to bite me.Lastly, I would caution myself to take my time and not try and run someone else’s race. Looking back now maybe I was sucked into WURA because someone else seems to be doing well with the same concept. Perhaps it was their idea and product to launch, and not mine, to begin with. ‍"," For marketing, we had a Facebook and YouTube page, did some SEO, built a mailing list through the site, and I reached out to several startup and entertainment blogs to get our name out there. We also offered promotions and free trial periods to get people in the door. We spent about $35,000 on Facebook alone, that helped get some signups both free and paid, also increased our mailing list. The blog outreach helped build some link juice for SEO for the most part. A mailing list was effective in converting free users to paid. Facebook was a terrible investment. For 2 reasons: Although we gained a lot of new users that signed up through Facebook (and we had a 1 click Facebook signup button on the site), we could not email those users our newsletters because Facebook apparently hides users original email addresses and gives them a Facebook email instead for example mike@facebook.com and because of this, when we send out a newsletter, those to the Facebook domain would bounce back. FYI: about 70% of WURA total users were Facebook users. We later found this out but we had already spent thousands of dollars to get all those users.Facebook algorithm sucks! Every time Facebook changes its algorithm, those with public Facebook pages suffer. After spending all that money and getting all the thousands of followers to our Facebook page, we realized that those followers were almost useless because anytime we made a post, we were only reaching about 3% of our entire followers.  "," You can visit my blog, or check my YouTube channel!"," There are many: Websites: Youtube – YouTube is the best go-to place to learn just about anything.

At early stages, it feels like your startup is nothing more than wishful thinking and any person can easily poke holes in your business concept, and you are bombarded with a wide variety of advice on how you should take your startup forward. It can be pretty terrifying to keep going ahead against all odds.

During our work with SMBs, we realized a huge gap in the market for e-commerce management systems for small companies - that there were none available. This gave us the idea to build a tool ourselves to help our clients sell more on Amazon through smart data analytics and intelligence ad campaign strategies. Some of the initial obstacles were to convince enough small business owners to trust us to manage their Amazon accounts though we had no prior experience at that point. We were lucky enough to get the first few clients, which led to us testing our hypothesis and making the full-fledged tool. ",," I am a first-generation immigrant with an engineering & MBA background. Xena Intelligence started as a fun side project while I had a marketing consulting business for SMBs.

My idea was to automate the entire process, enabling us to use specific algorithms to optimize further online sales - which was the crux of Xena Intelligence. My experience with the needs of small businesses certainly led me to build this tool to enable them to be more competitive against large companies with considerably more ad budgets.

283,yottio," My name is Jon Lawrence, I’m 46 years old and live in the Seattle metro area. I like to say that I haven’t failed enough to quit, but haven’t succeeded enough to make it worth my while, but that’s only half true.  The part that is true, is that I haven’t failed enough to quit, and that’s saying something. The part that isn’t true is that it hasn’t been worth my while.  It is fair to say I’ve never managed to get to a cushy exit from a venture, despite having a $20m term sheet on the table once. But along the way I’ve managed to learn enough from my mistakes that I found my way to leading teams whose work is challenging, sometimes inspiring, always teaching me new things and making a good living while I’m at it. Even better, I continue to learn and grow in ways that should I decide to take another swing at entrepreneurship, I’ll be sure to make new and original mistakes next time! I incorporated my first ‘business’ in 1995 while at college when I created a 501(c)(3) non-profit because some friends of mine and I felt like we could better serve ourselves and our interests in theater with some structure that would help us raise funds and pick productions that we wanted to make. No one really guided me through any of it, I’d just picked up a couple of books, and an “incorporate yourself” software kit that came on a set of 3.5” disks (!).  Little did I know it that would lead to incorporating almost a dozen entities involved in different types of businesses over the years to follow including production companies for media development and production, event production, underground wine storage (yes, really), and technology.  My first tech startup was in 2010 when a couple of friends and I figured that Twitch.tv was on to something, and we knew video production pretty well, so we tried to pair that with the nascent eSports movement. I raised close to $200k from friends and family, spent about 8 months building a beta product, got a few folks into the beta, and then depressingly ran out of runway (it was rather expensive to run hosted video streaming in the cloud 10 years ago). My second tech startup, a few years later in 2013, came on the heels of leading a fairly high-profile mobile game launch for an NBC show called “The Million Second Quiz.” As part of that project, I learned a lot of synchronous/real-time technologies that were really just emerging at a cost-benefit point that made them worth trying to use for media projects (open-source tech like Cassandra and RabbitMQ) and that lead me straight into Yottio. Yottio was a mobile-first mass-participation moderated video participation platform for broadcast television. ‍"," Even though we managed to find good leads at NABshow that were qualified and interested in our product each potential customer rightly wanted us to be able to come physically demo the platform at their broadcast control rooms. We were already running on fumes as far as cash flow went, and the only way we could come up with $20-30k in cash for purchasing and setting up the hardware and travel to do demonstrations was to raise outside capital, which we had been trying to do without much success. Since demo’s weren’t committed purchases, there wasn’t any contractual revenues we could secure debt against either.  This meant that being able to actually go try and close new customers was out of reach until we had a closed round of investment.  Additionally, our license agreements with our clients had an annual renewal fee, and quarterly license payments. When each quarterly bill came due, we invested an inordinate amount of time in chasing payments from our customer who paid months late on each invoice.  I also made a choice before joining as co-founder that I wanted to grow and run the business from Seattle instead of Los Angeles and that was part of my written agreement with my co-founder from the outset. So once we had our first customer on their feet, I set about getting moved to the Northwest and building a small team locally. It’s possible that staying in LA may have helped us turn a corner faster and in retrospect it’s a decision I’m not sure I’d take again (though the move has been demonstrably better for my family).  Simultaneously, as a fully formed corporate entity we were now on the hook for some of my co-founders debts that reared their head once we had some cash flow. In the end, the debt accounted for nearly 40% of the total revenue we had from our single customer. After finding out that we would have to pay at least some of it, I worked to set up payment plans with them so that we could keep operations going and hopefully get over the hump.  At the same time, we were endlessly pitching at startup competitions (never in ones that we had to pay to be a part of) working to secure a seed round of investment. We placed second in a highly competitive Seattle Angels Fund competition and highly in a number of others but never quite enough to close funding that would keep us alive.  Coming out of the NABshow convention, it looked like we had an anchor investor for our seed round which we decided to launch in connection with Flashfunders.  Flashfunders was an early crowdfunding platform designed to be compliant with the existing SEC Regulation D filing requirements, restricted only to accredited investors. Out of our $1.5m round, our anchor was committed to underwriting $400k, and we were ready to take our fundraising show out on the road.  One of the things that investors want to know about, is who’s on the founding team, and what’s their background? I was fortunate enough to have deep sector expertise and my co-founder had had a rather successful previous exit. A week into publicly launching the round, it looked like we might actually pull it off and that was when I got a LinkedIn notification telling me that my co-founder had a new job.  A few conversations later, he made it clear he wanted to do something he was more passionate about and that was that. He was out, but retained most of his stock due (which was a solid majority of the company ownership at ~60%) to the way we’d structured vesting, intentionally. He decided that he’d put some of his personal capital in to try and keep things afloat, meaning just enough that I could keep working on it, keep doing some development and support and that we could pay our taxes due in the next quarter.  The fundraising round almost immediately bogged down, where I struggled to find investors who were comfortable putting capital into a company where a majority shareholder had already decided they would not spend any more of their time.  So I tried to slog on independently with the fundraise, and this was the time we got an interesting acquisition offer from a tech holding company out of San Jose. Given where we were with cash flow, and that we had managed to get a core patent actually approved we decided to take the meetings. We were flown out for some very nice lunches and bottles of wine. We invested the time in providing all the necessary due diligence documentation and within several more meetings and conversations we were reviewing an offer letter for a $20m acquisition.  That was pretty damn exciting until we got into the details. As I drilled down into the offer, it was about $5m in cash, and $15m in stock in their holding company and when asked for an independent valuation of their stock, something started to smell really fishy.  After spending several more weeks attempting to get to an independent valuation of three-quarters of the acquisition offers value it became clear we were not going to be able to get a clear valuation of the stock offer, and quickly became highly questionable if the potential acquirer even had $5m in cash to offer.  The sale imploded the week following these discoveries. After that, my co-founder also seemed to change his mind about backstopping the company any further. Around the same time, it was clear that our Flashfunders round was not going to reach the floor we’d set for the round, which meant that we would not receive any cash from the committed investors without closing the current round and renegotiating some other form of equity investment at a lower price point.  With our one paying customer, whose license ran another four months at this point, we had outstanding functional requirements we were committed to deliver. I took out loans against some of the remaining assets my family and I had, which was largely limited to about $10k against our vehicles. That was enough to pay our developers to get the functional requirements done and delivered, but at this point I had no other way to pay my own bills.  My co-founder agreed that we could attempt to liquidate the IP, namely the core patent we’d been granted and I set about attempting to find a buyer for that while picking up other side work to try and keep a roof over our head. The side jobs managed to get us about a bit further down the road but with no buyers in the immediate future for the patent, the liabilities on the balance sheet and another round of upcoming taxes due I decided I could not continue any further.  With a round of really difficult-to-make phone calls and video conferences, I reached out to all the holders of our debt, and our developers and other stakeholders and made the call that I would resign as CEO. Given that I was not the majority stakeholder, the fate of the business as an entity would pass back to my co-founder. I spent a week or so compiling all the necessary documents and statements about what parts of business would need attention and in what order and delivered all of it in a neat digital bundle, followed on with a few boxes of all the backup physical paperwork and remaining physical assets.  At the end of the day, our failure really came down to: Inability to land new customers fast enough: Our product had a real chicken-egg problem, attempting to crack the egg in a really risk-averse industry where creative innovation moves historically very slowly was a mix that might have been better to just avoid altogether as a bootstrapped startup.  Physical move away from highest saturated market, made additional sales, and demo’s more difficult.Failure on my part to do greater due diligence on my co-founders prior commitments to others, specifically with regards to debts owed. Landing our first customer created early cashflow that overshadowed the misgivings I had about not knowing the full picture of liabilities associated with my cofounder and the efforts he’d undertaken trying to get the product off the ground in the US before he’d brought me in. It was only over the course of the first six months of operations that I really started to get a full picture, even after having fixed the lack of *any* properly papered intellectual property and development agreements, and all the normal paper that goes with a new C corp.  When I resigned, it was, for all intents and purposes, shutting down the company.  It meant letting the developers know what was going on, and offering to help them find other folks they could do work for to keep their lights on.  It meant calling creditors and telling them where the company was at, and what their options were for continuing pursuit of debt collection, and asking for their understanding and forgiveness where I could. It meant calling those folks who had options stakes in our cap table for various contributions and giving them my frank assessment, and apologies.  It meant I now had an extra $10k+ of personal debt to find a way to pay off. ",,,,," The original technology that my co-founder brought to the table was a couple of client-server Java applications that worked only using a static webcam on a desktop computer and standard definition video. It’s original iteration severely limited creative options, and the core tech it was built on was based on video standards no longer in production use.  When we met, he was trying to figure out if there was a market for the original product but had been unable to make any inroads with broadcasters for a couple of years. He had built the core platform and used it in a few broadcast programs in Italy in the early 2000s when the product was abandoned. I dug into the core of the platform to understand if it could be remade for a high-definition, mobile-first world and if so, would that be something we could sell to the market? Our delivery timeline for delivering the mobile product and high-definition video playout were dependent upon our customer having completed their control room build-out and on their completion of their mobile app. This meant we could actually use our initial licensing fee from the customer to pay our developers (and ourselves). With one Java developer, and one mobile developer and about five months of work, we refactored the original product into more modern working beta that was good enough and was still ready before our customer was ready to go live with it.  Because our process included hardware integrations we were literally re-writing the native video card drivers in C++ to get the speed and quality we needed to get low-latency video streams off cellular networks and into HD video mixing consoles within broadcast tolerances while dynamically creating the appropriate audio stream patches for participants and stage crews.  Since several of the hardware pieces would be installed in operating broadcast control booths, we also had to spec out and build a number of high-performance rack-mount PC’s to run the product. Building, installing and integrating the hardware was a task that I did myself for our customer, and included all the follow on support and personnel training on using the product in broadcast programs.  We later added an infrastructure engineer to properly secure out backend services and create some automation around provisioning resources using Ansible.  Building and supporting the platform was incredibly challenging, and most of the time I was the sole full-time employee. Our development team was primarily remote and worked as our funds allowed which was rarely full-time after the initial MVP build. After closing our initial customer, we went on the road to raise additional capital for continuing to build out the product.",," There’s a theory that there’s a correlation between toxoplasmosis and entrepreneurship - which makes me wonder if maybe I rolled around in some cat poop when I was a kid. Since my first entrepreneurial endeavors as a young person (lemonade stand, lawn mowing services) I’ve often made the risk-ignorant assumption that making a living I’m happy with depended upon learning things for myself and creating structure from nothing over and over and over again.  When it came to Yottio, I had a strong background in building interactive broadcast experiences, including working as head of production for a well-known production company where I was deeply involved in the game design and build for a couple of interactive game shows that we had sold to TBS and BET.  From an interactivity standpoint though, I thought the experiences we were building didn’t push the envelope far enough. However, what we could do with participants also had to accommodate the creative and legal processes that went with putting people on-air were things that weren’t easy to solve. The traditional methods of casting contestants and participants for creative formats are designed to give the creative team the most freedom for good stories, and stories that are technically well-produced, using processes that provided acceptable risk-management for the broadcasters.  When it comes to including participants in a broadcast-media format, three key elements that must be present.  Can producers find a participant that meets their creative requirements?Has the participant agreed to the legal release terms of appearing in the broadcast?Can the participant be seen and heard at high enough quality? When my co-founder showed me the original idea behind the desktop-based platform that he’d built, he had a solution that handled the second requirement pretty well, but the first and third were severely limited by requiring potential participants to be at a desktop PC with a webcam and having integration hardware that wasn’t up to modern broadcasting requirements. It seemed clear that we could create entirely new ways of having conversations if we could build a platform that could let anyone, anywhere, anytime be a part of a broadcast reaching millions of viewers live in a way that still allowed the creative production teams to produce and moderate on the fly and manage risk acceptably in the process.  What really made our product different from regular group video calling platforms was that we had a very slick interface for aggregating tens of thousands of potential participants, screening them rapidly based on things like location, battery and mobile device signal strength, audio & video quality, and social reputation and reach. The platform enabled content producers to drag and drop the participants they wanted into a given conversation while still being able to live moderate and control the conversations discreetly, and then output all of the individual video and audio streams in HD broadcast compatible formats in real-time.  The business model was a mix of professional services where we built and installed hardware packages in broadcast control rooms, licensed our software on those machines and paired the stack with companion mobile apps for iOS, Android and a web app.  I thought that if we got it right, our platform could democratize mass media conversations in a way that had not been done before and that it would inevitably be a good thing.  ‍"," If I had to do Yottio over again, I would probably choose to work on it part-time for a year or two, and not sell an enterprise product at all to start. Instead, I’d see if we could build a much properly SaaS-ified product so that we could avoid the hardware requirements for customers to trial. I would have loved to have moved the control interfaces out of their Java applications/GUI’s and into browser-based control. In 2019 this seems like a no-brainer in 2013 it was still pretty advanced to attempt to get multi-stream real-time video running reliably in-browser.  I wish that I had spent more time in due diligence overall though I’m not sure it would have changed my own choices. My co-founder had a core tech that was really neat and it was in my wheelhouse to make it work in a modern world. ‍"," The sales process in particular for our product was lengthy and problematic. A major factor that made sales difficult was that production companies buy or lease technology based on having sold show creative formats that rely on a given technology and the sales cycle time on show formats is much longer generally than the cash runway of your typical tech startup.  Our marketing/sales approach in this regard was to partner with known, successful producers who had existing network deals, and to create pilots and new show formats that could not be done without our technology and help them shop them around the broadcast networks. Because we had not yet raised the capital to move the product into a SaaS delivery model our options to get the product into a broader market was really limited to what we could do based on the professional broadcaster model where hardware was sold in as well.  We were at the right place at the right time, with the launch of a brand-new technology-forward network with Revolt Network. Since they were in startup as well, they were building out a brand-new control room which was a perfect opportunity to integrate our product from the beginning.  We spent a significant part of the first six months post-MVP to get the entire platform working with our customers new control room environment and supporting their app development agency as they attempted to get their app to work properly with our backend.  In early 2014, we launched on-air, with Revolt running segments called “Voices of Revolt” on their daily news program.  Towards the end of 2014 we also landed a competitive spot at a startup hub called “Sprockit” as part of the biggest broadcasters convention in the world, at NABshow in Las Vegas. At the convention, we generated a lot of interest, a lot of leads, and won a “Best of” award as part of our efforts there and this was a core part of our go-to-market approach.  We came away with three to four very solid prospects, that we had a 60-70% chance of converting to paid customers within the next 6 months. That would have put us well over $1m/year in business and in a position with sustainable cash flow. At the same time, we also had regional companies in South America and EU wanting to commit to being value-added resellers and installers in their respective regions, which was pretty exciting.  At this point, we had managed to also create a decent ability to live demo the platform without setting up a full stage production, and made it possible to run the entire demo with only two people (one producer, one participant).  "," In the wake of Yottio’s implosion and subsequent taking of a more “regular job,” I’ve also backed off a lot of my online presence not necessarily out of embarrassment, but much more due to the fact that curating an online presence and engaging in multiple social media channels to prove thought-leadership takes more time than I want to give to it anymore.  For years I had my own site with loads of film, tv, and some tech related work on it and when Quora launched, I invested a ton of time into production related thought leadership. My answers on that platform have been read by over half a million people and still earn three-to-four hundred reads a week almost ten years on (that’s kind of mind-blowing to me:).  Today, I’m active in my regular job, investing my non-work time in raising my ten-year old daughter and being a present husband to my awesome wife, who has hung tight through all of this. I contribute to some of the really neat work happening at the Chaoss Project and once in a while I side-eye some other crazy idea and I inadvertently wonder aloud “hey, maybe I should try that again…” before I come to my senses.  If folks would like to contact me, they can feel free to drop me a line at jon@mpgstudios.com I’m generally open to conversations, though I’m not at all looking for another startup to join. "," Being a middle-aged guy who’s done a few things, my favorite entrepreneurial resources are actually friends and past colleagues from other endeavors. These are friends in various industries, not just tech, who’ve been down their own roads in the past, and are usually willing to generously share their thoughts on strategic and tactical problems I faced.  Initially when I got into tech entrepreneurship, I read most of the standard bullshit TechCrunch, Vator, Gary Vaynerchuck (the early version) and loads of stuff from VC’s, FeldThoughts, Mark Cuban, et al. There were some valuable things to learn from those, especially things around term sheets, cap tables and financial models for investment.  I enjoyed books like the Hard Thing about Hard Things by Ben Horowitz, Startup Communities by Brad Feld the Long Tail by Chris Anderson and How to Get Rich by Felix Dennis (hint: it’s not what you think it is)  I’m a voracious reader, and also invested time in reading through and learning startup legal formation, due diligence preparation and was even jokingly offered a summer internship at Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich and Rosati by one of the partners there whom I’d managed to get to represent our company.  I constantly read about new technologies, primarily in cloud spaces these days since that’s where my current teams build products.  ‍"," Because we mostly bootstrapped our losses were contained to under about $150k in cash over the two years of operation. About $25k of that was convertible debt from friends and family, and the balance was cash from my co-founder and myself.  Our two year revenue was a bit over $200k, which wasn’t terrible for a single enterprise customer, but certainly not enough to sustain operations in a business that still required significant hardware investment.  ‍",Software & Hardware,Lack of Funds,United States,"January 14, 2020",Jon Lawrence,https://www.failory.com/interview/yottio,"['https://www.quora.com/profile/Jon-Lawrence', 'https://chaoss.community/', 'mailto:jon@mpgstudios.com']",failure,0,,"Jon was one of the Yottio’s co-founders, a mobile-first tool that enabled video participation on broadcast television.

284,young-entrepreneurs-program," My name is Fabian and I am a 24-year old content creator and entrepreneur from Berlin. Currently, I am advising early-stage startups between the ideation and seed phase on strategy and fundraising. I am also a sparring partner on content strategy for different companies. For me, my entrepreneurial journey started with a podcast in which I am interviewing successful entrepreneurs for nearly 5 years now. YEP started as a one-year educational program for entrepreneurs aged 17 to 23. We charged a program fee for the year in which they get a set of workshop weekends, a personal mentor, and accountability groups to stay on track. It was a one-man show to organize everything from A to Z, but this was only in my head. ‍"," To be honest, I made many crucial mistakes in the beginning. At first, we focused on entrepreneurs aged 17 to 23 years old because we weren’t a hundred percent sure if we could find enough people with the same industry focus or the same stage. Therefore we found a cohort of 28 participants that were in different stages and industries. The issue was arising to build a program that’s for entrepreneurs in different stages and that wasn’t possible.  The second mistake was to hire a full-time person to help me working on YEP when I wasn’t ready to lead anyone. I could not yet oversee what needed to be done so it felt hard to delegate and/or include somebody in the project. I was neither developing quickly enough nor able to prioritize in the right order. When the pandemic arose, we couldn’t meet in person anymore, which originally was a core part of our offering. During the beginning of the pandemic, we focused on building a paid online community and tried to use the pandemic as a catalyst for a more scalable business model. The willingness to pay substantial amounts of money for an online community wasn’t there, and everybody wanted to have the original program back.   We were able to get more and more members for our digital community but there was still the wish for in-person meetings as a core benefit. We weren’t cash flow positive yet, so when we were planning how to iterate for 2021, it was my turn to strategize. While I was brainstorming on how to continue, I realized that we weren’t set up for success.  At this point, I was the only person working on YEP, having roughly 35 subscribed members and some of them were already inactive and unhappy. At this moment, I realized that I had to reset the whole project and build it up from the ground up. I called my partners and told them that I didn’t think that we would be able to make YEP a successful project without substantial amounts of time and money, and suggested we shut the project down. To my surprise, they understood my perspective and were with me. We then started communicating with our members and shut YEP down during the next few weeks. I felt relieved because I was stressed out about the fact that I knew it wasn’t going as well as planned. ‍",,,,," In November 2018, I started talking to dozens of young founders who were in different stages to identify their needs. The key problems of these entrepreneurs were the lack of guidance and the lack of peers.  Therefore we developed a 1-year program consisting of the following: Peer-to-peer learning in accountability groups, one-to-one mentorship with a successful founder, and dedicated workshops on experiences of founders and hands-on topics every startup needs to know. We started communicating this offer 4 months after starting to research and in the next 2.5 months, we got 28 committed participants from the DACH region. All of them committed to pay 1,800€ per year."," There we find one of the issues: a yearly enrollment doesn’t allow scalability. That’s why at first, we planned two enrollments per year with growing participant numbers. To ensure the quality of members, we needed more applications per seat. As we had a very unique target group, we couldn’t go for Instagram ads or something similar. So we looked for niche communities like entrepreneurship initiatives at top universities, my podcast targeting young and aspiring entrepreneurs, recommendations from the most successful entrepreneurs in our network, and of course entrepreneurs from the network of our participants who were already part of the program.  Later on, we switched to a paid community for young entrepreneurs. This pivot was due to the pandemic and other issues. Our growth strategy with the paid community was the same as before except we could onboard as many entrepreneurs as we want. "," Before we started YEP, I was already running one of the largest German podcasts on entrepreneurship and startups. That means I’ve built a strong network of experienced founders and was the go-to person for young and aspiring entrepreneurs. My co-founder built a university in Germany. The CODE University of Applied Sciences, the first university in Germany where you can build a business and it’s helping you to get your bachelor’s degree. While discussing the startup ecosystem, we were realizing the lack of opportunities for young entrepreneurs to connect with peers and get access to an extensive network of experienced entrepreneurs. That’s when we came up with the idea of the Young Entrepreneurs’ Program. ‍"," Define target personas very clearlyLayout the vision and break it down into sizeable chunksOnly hire when target persona and vision are already setI’d try a more scalable approach from the beginning While conducting research, I would cluster the needs and problems to different target personas and would niche down my further interviews to one specific persona. My MVP would only serve this one customer persona instead of many. If I don’t find a product for this target group, I would try another. These are the concepts of product-market fit but I lost the focus. With that MVP, I would work on a bigger vision and break it down into sizable chunks to understand what needs to be done, and what skills are needed to achieve this. I would only hire somebody when the target persona and vision are already set, and the person aligns a hundred percent with the vision. And I would fire faster. From day one, my focus would be to find a more scalable version of the product than at the beginning of YEP. I knew about the shortcomings of the program approach but I thought we could outsmart the system - mission failed. I did not spend enough time building and leveraging the community we had. We had highly engaged members who would have been more than happy to help, but I thought I needed to be responsible for everything.  ",," The best way to stay updated or contact me for follow-up questions is my LinkedIn.

285,zapstream," 👋🏾 Hey! My name is Devan, I’m a first generation American with family from India, I’m twenty-three as of writing this and I grew up in LA. I started a fashion brand at fifteen and ran it for almost three years, then I co-founded a tech startup called Zapstream, and finally I attended Babson College. These days I run a growth agency for startups called 96, I lecture at high schools on what I call “Teentrepreneurship,” and I’m a proud board member at Project ECHO, a non-profit organization that brings entrepreneurial concepts into underserved high schools.  As mentioned, Zapstream was my first tech startup. Founded in Q1 ‘15, Zapstream was a social live streaming platform with live effects. We launched around the same time as and competed with Meerkat, which is now Houseparty, and Periscope, which was then bought and re-launched by Twitter. Keep reading to hear how we got all the way to 100k users but failed to take it to the next level.  "," The Zapstream product was solid and growing, but we faced fierce competitors. Meerkat had just launched, Periscope was relaunched by Twitter, and Facebook Live soft launched with celebrities. The combination of dwindling engagement, mismanagement of money, and our inability to fundraise further led to a painful and very prompt end to Zapstream. One day we were growing like crazy and everything was great, a week later the company was forced to shut down because the team couldn’t be paid. It was extremely painful to let Zapstream die like that, but revealed valuable lessons about management.  Team - When I first got there, the team was men with an average age of 38. They didn’t truly understand social platforms, they barely had a Facebook, but they understood the value in network effects and were able to pay to build a platform. Generally, this team wasn’t a good fit for the product.  Product - The product was good, but it wasn’t great. It was a social platform for young millennials that was designed by “boomer” technologists. Had the product been designed by the people who might use it, it might’ve been more engaging. Later at Zapstream we brought on a very talented designer to redesign the platform, but, unfortunately, her UI barely saw the light of day.  Fundraising - This was the biggest hitch. Because of the other two problems, fundraising was already tough. With the fundraise we may have been able to amend the product and team, but without it we were dead in the water. We had raised ~$1m for Zapstream from angels and the network of the CEO, so understandably he wanted to raise ~$4m at a much higher valuation. To all the serious investors we talked with, the valuation we were seeking was just too high, and we failed to raise any money because the CEO wouldn’t lower it. Big lesson learned."," The biggest mistake I made was not speaking up and being more vocal. I knew the team wasn’t right, I knew the product wasn’t incredible, but at the time I was extremely unfamiliar with the fundraising process. I truly believe if we raised $1-2m from an institution then we could’ve taken on Periscope, but we played a binary game and lost. Even more unfortunately, I did not overcome my inability to speak up in time, and Zapstream came to a slow and painful end.  ‍",,,," The onLoop resources were pivoted to Zapstream and technical team got to work quickly. The CEO raised another ~$250k from angels in his network and the whole team moved to work on Zapstream. There was no UI designer at the time, so the technical team was forced to design it too, but they designed and built a fully functioning app in ~2 months. We got the app up and running in what felt like no time, but it wasn’t very nice-looking, likely because it was designed by some older engineers. The technical aspect, which usually is the hardest gap to fill, felt like no obstacle at all.  In a short time we built a live streaming app that worked with custom color filters. The big feature that differentiated us were “Zaps,” which evolved over time. First Zaps started out as a broadcaster-selected 15-second snippet of the live stream that stayed native to the platform. What we quickly found was that live creators didn’t want to spend additional time creating a snippet, it was too burdensome. So, after a few weeks, we pivoted Zaps to be viewer-generated GIFs that stayed native in a gallery after the stream was finished. Viewer-generated GIFs were huge, instantly we saw the number of Zaps created skyrocket.",," The story is a little long, but here’s the short version. Social media was my first love. I fell in love with Snapchat as an 8th grader, I must’ve been one of the first few thousand users. It totally changed my social life and even how I thought about marketing later on. I made new friends, made other relationships much stronger, and even got into a romantic relationship, all because of social media before 10th grade.  In February of ‘15 I consulted for a company called onLoop, a messaging platform founded by a forty-something year old that was targeting high schoolers and college students. He had raised a little over $1m and had a full team of eleven including a full time CTO and three other engineers. However, within four weeks I told him with his poor engagement metrics there was no possibility to scale economically and raise money, but he knew it wasn’t going well and already wanted to pivot. He wanted to build a live streaming platform because live video was the most popular tool used in onLoop. I agreed it could be a great idea and he challenged me to come up with a fully fledged idea by the following Monday. I then pitched him my idea, the name Zapstream and all the features it would include, I even made some sketches with some preliminary ideas. They loved it, started to build it in March, and offered me a full time position out of high school as the Chief Marketing Officer.  "," If I tried to start over I would do almost the exact opposite of what we did. I’m a strong believer that the best way to build a consumer product is to create something fun and iterate according to user feedback. Starting from the beginning, I’d start with a paper + pen prototype, then finalize UI in Figma, then create a prototype that I can send out (also in Figma), then create the core MVP and build a beta list of <1000 users. Once you have beta users, pay close attention to their feedback, explore user flows and understand what’s working and what’s not. Make sure you’re not throwing extra money around, spend as little as possible to validate your product.  I still think the Zapstream concept is superior to the other live video products out there. That designer we hired and I are still good friends, just the other day we were joking about how incredible Zapstream could’ve been during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our vision was to take live interaction to the next level, including multiplayer games and fun reasons to go live. There’s definitely still space for that.  ‍"," This was my first time building a full campaign for a technology company, a free mobile app nonetheless, and it was definitely intimidating. We tried a few different strategies, but as a lover of social media I knew that we needed to find a way to harness the power of virality on other social platforms. After lots of testing and iterating, we ended up finding influencers to be the most economical method to grow. Once we figured out the right features, we decided to “relaunch” with an ambitious plan. We teamed up with Jake Paul who was at the time just starting to figure out the business model for his new venture, Team10. Jake and I met at a coffee shop in Beverly Hills, talked for a little under an hour and closed on a deal. If Jake produced over X downloads, he would vest up to Y% of the company’s total equity (and I think a small cash component too). Unfortunately, Jake bailed on the deal after producing a mere 1200 downloads, though we learned good lessons about working with influencers.  Soon after, I created a model that would estimate the number of downloads an influencer would bring in based on their public social media metrics, and we picked ~30 smaller Vine and Instagram influencers using that model. We paid over $60k out to influencers alone, but drove over 75k downloads using this strategy. We were written about on multiple websites and I even got to appear on Fox Business. ‍"," These days I’m helping startups with growth at my firm, 96.

286,zenmaid," I’m Amar Ghose, the CEO, and co-founder of ZenMaid. I also recently launched a podcast, the Surround Sound SaaS Marketing podcast, where I talk about the various things we do for marketing on ZenMaid. I’m 34 years old, and I’m currently based in London, United Kingdom, although I've spent the last 6 years traveling the world as a digital nomad. I built ZenMaid from 33 countries over the 8 years we've been in business. ZenMaid is a niche scheduling software for maid services. We help cleaners manage their schedules, handle communications, and automate various tasks that allow them to earn more while doing less. Our goal is to handle everything that leads up and everything that happens after the cleaning with our software. Our business model is a typical SaaS people pay us on a subscription basis, anywhere from $49 to $500 a month (around $220 on average). ‍",," On a personal level, I'm a non-technical founder. So it’s a challenge when it comes to building a software company. My co-founder and I had almost no leadership experience, so building ZenMaid was just figuring it out as we came. We also didn't have any reputation in the industry, with no audience. When we were cold emailing to get our first hundred customers, people weren’t responding, and our emails were going to spam because we just sounded like two random dudes from India asking them for money for software that didn’t exist yet. We had to hire a friend who had a bit more of a friendly name. In comparison to our competition, we had no funding, which was a significant obstacle to overcome.  We were also working remotely back in 2013 when we first started ZenMaid, although we were still in the same town. We'd see each other a couple of times a week to chat, which was also another challenge. The final obstacle that we've overcome was picking a very challenging market. Maid services tend to be late adopters. It took us a long time to get to $10,000 in monthly recurring revenue, which wouldn't even cover their living expenses for many founders. It took us over three years to go from zero to $10k in MRR, and then another four years to go from $10k to $100k MRR.  As for the biggest mistake that we've made in ZenMaid history, we spent over a year working on a redesign of the software and moving different things around both UI and UX changes, as well as releasing a couple of new features. We took that live and took down our system for almost three days in the middle of the week. It was in 2017 and ended up costing us between 30 and 35% of our MRR over the following six months. We were at $18k in monthly recurring revenue when we launched that redesign. And we essentially went back down to $12k. The new design was much better than the old one, but the transition was very painful. It was poor leadership on my part and then poor communication by multiple parties within the company. ",," The business today is growing nicely, and we're at $1.5 million in annual recurring revenue. We have a full-time team of six people, and then we have another 20 to 25 freelancers agencies, contractors, and part-time folks. Our goal is to keep our slow and steady growth rate. We're looking at 40% year-over-year growth as the minimum acceptable that we're looking for. ",," When we were validating our idea, we started building ZenMaid simultaneously. We had already committed to the idea before doing any customer research. My co-founder was doing all the coding, and I was cold emailing maid services to talk about their scheduling issues. We realized there was a big marketing gap in the industry, which we could fill. Designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product took us six months, and that’s when we finally got paid for it. We got paid $1000 for lifetime access to the software. We got paid about a month before the product was fully ready to go and could be used. Our significant weakness when we started was that neither of us were designers, and that showed for quite a long time until we did a redesign. Luckily we picked an industry where the design wasn’t too important. We weren't working with designers we weren't working with developers. The standards were decently low as long as the software worked as expected. When the product was ready, we felt no one would care. So, we quietly launched the product and began onboarding people as they found us. We started at $19 a month, quickly went to $29 a month. And then we went up to $49 a month. Over time the pricing strategy has changed. Now we're at usage-based pricing, so we still have the $49 based price, but it's now $9 per month per employee in addition to the owner.",," Before starting ZenMaid, I worked for a company in Southern California, and I was pretty miserable there. I was working with my best friend, which was pretty much the only redeeming quality of the job. During that time, I started a maid service called “Fast, Friendly, Spotless”. I was just trying to escape my day job, and after getting tired of both projects, I ended up moving back to where I grew up in Silicon Valley. My previous maid service project helped shape the ZenMaid idea. I started ZenMaid with my friend Arun Devabhaktuni at the same time as I joined a startup called UserVoice. I worked at UserVoice for about two years while working on ZenMaid before and after work. And that was a lot better than my previous job. I was much happier. I was always trying to come up with side hustles but always thinking on a very small scale and small level. If I had been thinking bigger from a younger age, I would have come across something like ZenMaid much faster. I left the United States in 2015 and built ZenMaid while traveling to 30+ countries as a digital nomad. I spent most of the time between Bali, Thailand, and Europe (with 1-2 months in the US each year). "," The number one lesson is to don't give up. When I look at ZenMaid versus some of our competitors that didn't make it, it's just that we kept breaking through barriers and obstacles and wouldn't let anything get in our way. Most of our competitors who closed didn't fail they decided to stop trying at some point. The other thing I would say is playing to your strengths. Focus more on your strengths rather than addressing your weaknesses. My ability to sell one-on-one is not the best, so we doubled down on marketing. Eventually, you can get to the point where you can hire a team to do whatever is fast, and you can just pay people who are good at specific strategies that you want to put in place. But until you get to that point, focusing on what you already do best will move the needle the fastest. Also, document everything or think about everything in terms of processes and systems. I recommend Principles by Ray Dalio, which explains why you want to have everything well-defined within your company.  There’s a good chance that 20% of your day is creating 80% of the results within a business. In some companies, you will have 20% of your customers, making you 80% of the money. Thinking about this can help you figure out how to focus and prioritize. It’s beneficial to revisit and reimplement all these lessons I do it once a year or every 2 years. Every time I do it, my productivity goes up, and I get a little bit happier because I got more time to spend on the things that I love."," I've always considered myself a marketing-first founder. Since day one, we've been running different marketing campaigns and tried many things over the years. Any marketing channel or marketing campaign can work as long as you find the right audience and have the right offer and product. We started with paid advertising of a hundred dollars per month to put into Google Ads for our target keyword, “maid service software”. And we slowly built that up. Now we spend about $20,000 a month on paid advertising. We also used cold email to grow to our first 100 customers. We were listed on every directory that we could find for SaaS companies to get easy backlinks. We have focused a bit on SEO over time, but we mainly published lots of content.

", TwitterThe AmaricanDreamZenMaid Website," I'm not going to recommend any tools because I think the tools change over time. Everyone should do their evaluations and figure out what's best for their company. I want to recommend some books and podcasts that have changed my thinking. The first one is The Ultimate Sales Machine by Chet Holmes. It’s the go-to resource to rethink your sales, your marketing, your go-to-market strategy, how you're getting people to pull out their wallets and give you money. Next up, Principles by Ray Dalio, which is the operating manual. You’ll learn how to develop processes, procedures, systems in your business that can take you to the next level. The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss. This book sells you the lifestyle of working from anywhere around the world. The Jobs Biography on Steve jobs, the Elon Biography on Elon Musk, and the Fish that Ate the Whale, which is about an immigrant entrepreneur who came and built a massive empire. Those three books are excellent in thinking about different business challenges that life throws at you. To recommend two quick podcasts, there's the Tropical MBA podcast for nomadic entrepreneurs or those aspiring to be nomadic entrepreneurs. There's also the more recently popular My First Million podcast with Sam Parr and Shaan Puri. The last resource I would recommend is the Farnam street blog by Shane Parrish, which talks about decision-making and mental models.

ZenOutreach is a lead generation company for agencies. We offer handcrafted lists of leads and cold email as a service. I am the company’s founder, so currently, I am focusing on marketing the company and building the team.  ",,,," We have reached $6k MRR. We have about 75% margins (our costs are currently some software tools + two part-time employees), so that means I can focus full-time. That was my biggest goal this year! Now that we know who we are willing to target, we focus on growth but setting up strong foundations first. I am looking for a Project Manager to handle the day-to-day work + onboard new clients. I am still planning to do discovery calls myself, but once I've got that process ironed out, I'll delegate this as well. We’ll also start investing in SEO with our new agency that’s being onboarded this month. As odd as it is, I am running a lead generation company but haven't set up my CRM yet! The plan is to do that this quarter as well to nurture and follow up on leads.",," When I started ZenOutreach, I decided to offer list-building and cold email services to everyone. After looking at my most successful clients, I decided to focus only on agencies. This helped us clarify our messaging and gave us a clear strategy as to where to get clients. Crystal clear positioning also helps prospects when considering to work with us vs. the competition. We focus on prospects that: a) Have a minimum budget to spend. b) Have a LTV high enough to focus on outreach. c) Are committed to spending 3 months min. with us. d) Have a strong value proposition. This eliminated a lot of prospects in our discovery calls, but those ready to commit were a much better fit/easier to work with and likely to stick longer with our services because they were patient enough to see a ROI and had a strong value proposition.  Once we identified the right-fit prospects, we made sure to properly onboard them. A few areas to consider: a) Clarify what's your role as an agency (what you do/don't do). b) Explain how much input you need from them + what are the expected timelines. c) Give them best practices to be more successful with your services. The idea is to make clients feel part of your team and your agency an extension of their existing team. ",," I am a law graduate and became an entrepreneur. I previously started an online letting agency that grew to $300k/year in revenue. Right before doing ZenOutreach, I was working as a sales manager for an e-commerce service company.  The idea of ZenOutreach came from my past experiences. Every business needs clients, and companies struggle to get them."," Having a specific niche is essential to have tremendous success. Do not hesitate to raise your price when it makes sense. Clients are easier to work with, have more established businesses, and know exactly what they want. Margins are now a lot higher (70-80%), which allows us to reinvest in the team (we can now afford more experienced staff) + reinvest in growth. ", Email outreach mainly from the start until now and networking in different Facebook groups for entrepreneurs. I want now to start also focusing on SEO by onboarding a content writing agency this month.

Zogics caters to the health, fitness, hospitality, educational, and aviation industries. The company was featured on the Inc. 5000 list as one of the fastest-growing private businesses in the US and has won numerous awards for its workplace culture.  In my role, I lead the company’s sales and marketing departments to help grow top-line revenue. I’m able to share my expertise in leading and scaling growth through sales and marketing alignment and ""operationalizing"" sales strategies. With a focus on customer satisfaction and revenue generation, I balance strategic planning and tactical execution. ",," Our biggest challenge so far has been keeping up with the surge in demand due to COVID-19. While many businesses were downsizing or shutting down, we experienced the opposite. Almost overnight our web traffic and sales quadrupled. It’s a good problem to have, but not something we anticipated. We had to quickly hire additional team members and set up systems in place to make sure we have enough products stocked in our warehouse. The challenge we face now is projecting what our business looks like next year and beyond as the impact of the pandemic changes.  One of the mistakes we’ve made is our brand positioning. We were able to gain initial traction by focusing on the fitness industry. This was helpful in the early days of the company because we were able to carve out a niche. However, it also limited our growth opportunities. Because all of the messaging on our website discussed how our products could benefit gym and fitness studio owners, we missed out on opportunities to sell our products to other types of businesses such as airports, hotels, schools, and hospitals. We’re now fixing this mistake by revamping our brand positioning and adding new pages on our website to help attract more customers from industries outside of fitness. However, it’s a challenge to change how a brand is perceived once it has been established.  ",," As I mentioned, our revenue has fluctuated significantly during the pandemic. Last year we did close to $35 million in revenue. However, this year we’re closer to being on track for $20 million. We have approximately 40 employees and contractors. Most recently, we’ve hired a new Chief Operating Officer to help streamline our processes and make the company more efficient. Like many companies, our goal is to continue to grow. We’ll look to do that internally and externally. In the past few years, we’ve acquired two businesses. We may consider future acquisitions if the fit is right.  ",," It all started when the company founder, Paul LeBlanc, was fixing a flat tire on his bike during a long ride. His hands were covered in grease and he had a eureka moment: he needed a wipe to clean his hands and bike. From there, the company started by developing wellness and facility items for gyms.  He spearheaded the initial effort by developing the degreasing wipes and pouring everything into their development, including design, development, and packaging of the degreasing wipes. Funding the development of the wipes was a challenge Paul rented out his home for the summer (and moved in with his parents) to help secure the funds needed. Paul tried several different promotional strategies in the early days. He rented a van and drove across the country from bike shop to bike shop with his wipes, selling directly to shop owners. He also snuck into the largest bike trade show in Las Vegas, giving away free samples of his degreaser wipes as he walked the floor. After a few years of nose-to-the-grindstone, the wipe started to gain traction, and new products were added as the company grew. The first Zogics employee was hired in 2010. ",," The company was started in 2006. The initial goal was to solve a problem the CEO faced: he needed wipes to clean the grease off his hands after fixing his bike. Our brand of cleaning wipes continues to be our flagship product today. However, we’ve expanded into other categories and established the company as one of the largest retailers for facility cleaning, disinfecting, and sanitizing products.   We’re the industry leader in facility cleaning supplies, and experts in facility safety, which encompasses everything from surface disinfecting and cleaning, including List-N approved disinfectants, cleaning, and hand wipes, to electrostatic sprayers, air quality tools, and more. We're proud to provide critical supplies for facilities to keep their employees and guests safe. Before joining Zogics, I ran a digital marketing firm called i3. It was a full-service agency that consulted e-commerce businesses on web development, content marketing, and email nurturing. I was inspired to join Zogics because I wanted to be part of an internal team. At an agency, you gain exposure to different businesses and industries. I wanted to utilize my expertise in e-commerce to help a brand grow. Transitioning from being the CEO of a company I started to CRO of an exiting business was an adjustment. It required humility and an ability to adapt.  ", You don’t need to invest something completely new or revolutionary to be a successful entrepreneur. Some of the longest-standing businesses solve a critical problem for their customers with a simple product or service. That’s why Zogics has been able to continue to grow over years: we’ve been laser-focused on serving our customers and meeting their needs. Is something that has been a common theme throughout my career. ," As an e-commerce company, it’s critical that prospective customers can find our website online. We invest in digital channels like content marketing, SEO, social media, and email. Our most successful marketing so far has been our blog. It has allowed us to write articles that help us inform prospective and current customers about the nuances of our products, which can be very technical.

289,zor-technology," Hi, I’m Mat. The biggest startup failure I’ve had in life was when I decided to put some efforts to build a business. I was always building useless products like Hardcore Prawn Lawn, a website that has no purpose, receives on average 230,000 unique visitors, and was eventually sold for thousands of dollars.  Flip back to 2008, I was a naive 16-year-old who decided to get into importing consumer electronics, such as USB drives and MP3 players. I saved up $1,000 from working a horrible afternoon job and was on my way to becoming the first debt-free graduate in recent years. Fast forward less than 12 months later, the business, which was now named Zor Technology, was on track to do 6 figures in its first year, I was put on one of those humiliating “top ten young entrepreneurs to watch” lists and overnight, it ended with a threatening call from Apple. Nowadays, I’ve grown up. I’m currently working on Wacky Waving Man, the world’s first USB-powered wacky waving man desk toy. This is something that I’m incredibly passionate about. It’s useless, it has cost me a shit ton of money to create, is over-engineered and again, serves no purpose.  ‍"," The business failed because I didn’t know my shit. If I had ten years’ experience, I would have known that you can’t sell a product that so closely resembles other companies IP. I still remember the day I got the phone call, I was sitting in the library processing orders and talking with my supplier when my phone starts ringing with an unusual number on the caller ID. It was a man who claimed to be from a law firm representing a major business in the MP3 industry. The similarity between my MP3 Player and this company’s product was too close. I had to cease operations immediately or be sued. I couldn’t take another order, I couldn’t accept any more payments, and I couldn’t even trade under the same name. My stomach dropped, I started to sweat and I was utterly… confused. On the computer screen were orders and legally, I couldn’t touch them from now on. The past 7 months of my life gone. I remember coming home, walking into my room and just laying down and staring at the roof for hours, just thinking about what I was going to do. I was a 16 year old in too deep. ‍"," The entire process of building a consumer electronics business back in 2008 as a 16-year-old was a challenge. I'm pretty sure my internet connection at the time here in Australia was close to dial-up speeds so imagine the shock when I found out that I could connect to suppliers in China over the web. I mean, everything back then was new to me, I had no fucking idea what I was doing so everything was a challenge. Heck, even getting online at the time was a challenge. I know now I would be able to manage the business much better. Anyway, I would definitely don’t start again. It’s tough to decide to go back to when you were 16 years old and start over. Majority of my teenage regrets have nothing to do with business and more to do with… other things.",,,,," At first, I was selling all my products on eBay. If you’re unfamiliar with eBay as a seller, it’s essentially like your first time with a prostitute. Everybody is disappointed with the end result, the seller is always the one getting fucked and when it’s all over you’re crying in the dark alone. I realized it wasn’t a long-term solution and decided to move away from it. Over time I would sell my products on my own website, however I didn’t invest a single dollar into marketing. All sales were made either through word of mouth or referrals. I’d like to refer to my blog post titled: “My Early Business Life: A 6 Figure Business That Fell Apart When I Was 16” where I talked about one of my marketing strategies: “Because I was always busy both before and after school, some of my friends caught wind of what I was doing and wanted in. Looking back now, I had somehow recruited affiliates, but back then they were simply friends helping out. I had designed a flyer template which I gave to each affiliate (I’ll stick with the term affiliate for now) and had them add in their name and contact number at the bottom of the flyer. I raised my prices to $55.00 per item giving each affiliate $15.00 per sale which left me with $40.00 profit. I remember before the Christmas break going to school a few times with a box full of MP3 players and handing out lots of 10 to people who expressed interest in selling. This was probably one of the easiest things I did to make a few thousand dollars – who knew teenagers were good salespeople!” Within a few months, the business was doing it pretty well and was on track to 6 figures in the first year. My entrepreneurial story started to go viral which helped me make Zor Technology more famous. However, everything was going too well to be true. Only a few months before the business turned one year, I was forced to shut it down."," I was 16 years old when I first started importing consumer electronics. My only motivation was to help improve my families’ standard of living. Prior to this, I was at school Monday-Friday and working every afternoon at my local printers getting paid $6.50 an hour. When you grow up with a single parent working 4 jobs to put food on the table, you realize pretty quickly that you need to help out in whatever way you can. ‍",,," You can check out my Twitter, my blog or my new project. Thanks for reading!"," I have to be honest when I say that I don’t actively seek out “entrepreneurial resources”.

I no longer have access to the financials. However, we had a great profit margin. For example, one of our MP3 players was being purchased for $4.20 and sold for $49.95.
